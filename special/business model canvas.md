```Python

# import ../../tools/utility.py.md
```

## business model generation

Business model generation is for {@{the entrepreneurial-spirited, value creators, and business innovators}@}. A business model shows {@{how an organization create, deliver, and capture value}@}.

## canvas

The business model canvas consists of 9 [building blocks](#building%20blocks). It can be used for {@{new or existing business models}@}. It works best when {@{it is on a large surface and groups of people can contribute and discuss}@}.

### building blocks

There are 9 building blocks to a business model canvas:

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("28ba", "e441",),
  R"""
CS: [customer segments](#customer%20segments)
VP: [value propositions](#value%20propositions)
CH: [channels](#channels)
CR: [customer relationships](#customer%20relationships)
R$: [revenue streams](#revenue%20streams)
KR: [key resources](#key%20resources)
KA: [key activities](#key%20activities)
KP: [key partnerships](#key%20partnerships)
C$: [cost structure](#cost%20structure)
""".strip().splitlines(),
)
```

#### customer segments

The customer segments building block shows {@{the different groups an organization is trying to serve}@}. Customers are the heart of any business model because {@{without them, no business can work}@}.

Customers should be separated into different segments if {@{they have different needs, need different [distribution channels](#channels), different [customer relationships](#customer%20relationships), very different profitability, or needing different aspects of your products}@}.

##### customer segment examples

There are different types of customer segments. Examples include:

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("cc13", "9b8a",),
  R"""
diversified: serving unrelated customer segments
mass market: not distinguishing between customer segments
multi-sided platforms: serving interdependent customer segments
niche market: focusing on specific, specialized customer segments
segmented: splitting slightly different customer segments
""".strip().splitlines(),
)
```

#### value propositions

The value propositions building block shows {@{products and services that create value for customer segments}@}. Value propositions can be {@{disruptive or an improvement over existing products}@}.

##### value sources

Values can come from many things:

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("9ab1", "c321",),
  R"""
accessibility
brand or status
convenience or usability

performance
performing the job well
price
risk reduction
""".strip().splitlines(),

#### channels

The channels building block shows {@{the ways to reach customers and deliver value propositions}@}. Channels phases are split into {@{five phases, in chronological order: awareness, evaluation, purchase, delivery, and after sales}@}. Channels can be classified into {@{own or partner, and direct or indirect. Partner channels are always indirect}@}.

#### customer relationships

The customer relationships building block shows {@{the types of relationships with customer segments}@}. Proper customer relationships help with {@{customer acquisition, customer retention, and upselling}@}.

##### customer relationship examples

There are different types of customer relationships. Examples include:

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("0362", "ca84",),
  R"""
automated services
co-creation
communities

#### revenue streams

The revenue streams building block show {@{how the organization generates money from customers}@}. There are two main types of revenue streams: {@{transaction, one-time payment; and recurring, recurrent payment}@}. There are [many ways to generate revenue streams](#revenue%20stream%20examples). There are also two main ways to price things: {@{fixed, pricing based on static conditions; and dynamic, pricing based on market conditions}@}.

##### revenue stream examples

There are different types of revenue streams. Examples include:

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("bb35", "1942",),
  R"""
advertising
asset sale
brokerage fee
lending, renting, or leasing
licensing
usage fee
subscription fee
""".strip().splitlines(),
)
```

#### key resources

The key resources building block shows {@{important assets required for the business model}@}. They can be categorized into {@{financial, human, intellectual, and physical}@} assets.

#### key activities

The key activities building block shows {@{important activities required for the business model}@}. They can be categorized into {@{platform or network, problem solving, and production}@} activities.

#### key partnerships

The key partnerships building block shows {@{important suppliers and networks required for the business model}@}. They can be categorized into {@{buyer–seller relationships, coopetitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances between non-competitors}@}. Partnerships can {@{acquire particular activities and resources, optimize for economy of scale, and reduce risk and uncertainty}@}.

#### cost structure

The cost structure building block shows {@{all costs required to run the business model}@}. Business models, with respect to the cost structure, can be categorized into {@{cost-driven and value-driven, though most organizations fall somewhere between these two}@}.

In cost structures, costs can be {@{fixed costs or variable costs}@}. Costs can be reduced by {@{economies of scale and economies of scope}@}.

### fit

Business model fit can be achieved by {@{reiteration between changing the value propositions and the rest of the business model}@}, because these two {@{are interdependent on each other: changing one entails changing the other}@}. The changes can be {@{big or small}@}: pivot {@{means making radical changes to the business model because your code idea requires more exploration}@}, while iteration {@{means reorienting the business model slightly but still closely related to the original}@}.

## comparison with other models

The business model canvas can be grouped into {@{4 sections: "how" for key blocks, "what" for value propositions, "who" for customer blocks, and "how much" for cost structure and revenue streams}@}. It can also be grouped into {@{3 sections: "feasibility" for key blocks, "desirability" for value propositions and customer blocks, and "viability" for cost structure and revenue streams}@}. This is similar to {@{[design thinking](../general/design%20thinking.md)}@}.
