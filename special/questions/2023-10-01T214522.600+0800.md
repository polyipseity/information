# 2023-10-01T214522.600+0800

A block of mass $m_A$ is on a table. It is connected to a block of mass $m_B$, which is hanging in the air, via an inextensible massless string. The string is hung over a pulley of radius $R$ and moment of inertia $I$ at an edge of the table, and does not slip over the pulley. The kinetic friction coefficient between the block on the table and the table surface is $\mu_k$. The system is released from rest, and the hanging block descends by $d$. Express the speed of the hanging block $v_B$ as a function of $d$. Assume all variables have standard SI units.

## strategy

- inspecting "Express the speed of the hanging block $v_B$ as a function of $d$." :@: Equate the energies in terms of $v_B$ and $d$.

## solution

$$\begin{aligned}
m_Bgd&=\frac12(m_A+m_B)v_B^2+\frac12I\left(\frac{v_B}R\right)^2+m_Agd\mu_k\\
m_Bgd-m_Agd\mu_k&=\left(\frac12(m_A+m_B)+\frac{I}{2R^2}\right)v_B^2\\
v_B&=\sqrt{\frac{2m_Bgd-2m_Agd\mu_k}{m_A+m_B+\frac{I}{R^2} } }
\end{aligned}$$
