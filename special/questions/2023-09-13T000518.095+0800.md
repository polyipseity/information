The length of a piece of plastic pipe is measured as 7.0 m correct to the nearest 0.1 m.

1. Find the least possible length of the plastic pipe.
2. Is it possible to cut this pipe into some pieces of shorter plastic pipes, with each length measured as 30 cm correct to the nearest 0.1 m? Explain your answer.

> 1. <a></a> $$\begin{aligned}
\text{required answer}&=7-\frac{0.1}2\\
&=6.95\text{ m}
\end{aligned}$$
> 2. <a></a> $$\begin{aligned}
&\begin{aligned}
\text{least possible number of pipes}&=\frac{695}{30+\frac{0.1}2}\\
&=\frac{695}{30.05}\\
&=23.1\text{ (cor. to 3 sig. fig.)}\\
\text{most possible number of pipes}&=\frac{700+\frac{10}2}{30-\frac{0.1}2}\\
&=\frac{705}{29.95}\\
&=23.5\text{ (cor. to 3 sig. fig.)}\\
\end{aligned}\\
&\because\text{There are no integers in between 23.1 and 23.5,}\\
&\therefore\text{No, it is not possible.}
\end{aligned}$$
