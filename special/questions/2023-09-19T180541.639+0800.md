# 2023-09-19T180541.639+0800

Starting from the origin, what range of initial speed $v_0$ should a projectile thrown at 45 degrees above horizontal have such that it falls in between $(6D, 2D)$ and $(7D, 2D)$? The only force acting on the projectile is the force $g$.

## strategy

- inspecting "what range of initial speed $v_0$ should a projectile thrown at 45 degrees above horizontal have such that it falls in between $(6D, 2D)$ and $(7D, 2D)$" :: Find the equation for position of the projectile as a function of time. By intuition, the initial velocity lower limit is determined by $(6D, 2D)$, while the upper limit is determined by $(7D, 2D)$. <!--SR:!2025-02-19,170,310-->

## solution

$$\begin{aligned}
&\begin{aligned}
\vec{r}&=\left(\frac{\sqrt2v_0t}2,\frac{\sqrt2v_0t}2-\frac{gt^2}2\right)\\
\end{aligned}\\
&\text{For }(6D,2D)\text{,}\\
&\begin{aligned}
\frac{\sqrt2v_0t}2&=6D\\
t&=\frac{12D}{\sqrt2v_0}\\
\frac{\sqrt2v_0t}2-\frac{gt^2}{2}&=2D\\
6D-\frac{36gD^2}{v_0^2}&=2D\\
\frac{36gD^2}{v_0^2}&=4D\\
v_0^2&=9gD\\
v_0&=\sqrt{9gD} && (v_0\ge0)
\end{aligned}\\
&\text{For }(7D,2D)\text{,}\\
&\begin{aligned}
\frac{\sqrt2v_0t}2&=7D\\
t&=\frac{14D}{\sqrt2v_0}\\
\frac{\sqrt2v_0t}2-\frac{gt^2}{2}&=2D\\
7D-\frac{49gD^2}{v_0^2}&=2D\\
\frac{49gD^2}{v_0^2}&=5D\\
v_0^2&=\frac{49gD}5\\
v_0&=\sqrt{\frac{49gD}5} && (v_0\ge0)
\end{aligned}\\
&\therefore{}v_0\in\left[\sqrt{9gD},\sqrt{\frac{49gD}5}\right]
\end{aligned}$$
