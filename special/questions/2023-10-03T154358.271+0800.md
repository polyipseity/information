Water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate of 13000 cubic centimeters per min at the same time that water is being pumped into the tank at a constant rate. The tank has height 15 meters and the diameter at the top is 6.5 meters. If the water level is rising at a rate of 20 centimeters per minute when the height of the water is 2 meters, find the rate at which water is being pumped into the tank in cubic centimeters per minute.

## strategy

- inspecting "Water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate of 13000 cubic centimeters per min at the same time that water is being pumped into the tank at a constant rate. The tank has height 15 meters and the diameter at the top is 6.5 meters. If the water level is rising at a rate of 20 centimeters per minute when the height of the water is 2 meters, find the rate at which water is being pumped into the tank in cubic centimeters per minute." :@: Rewrite the question using mathematics (should have $V$, $h$, $\frac {\mathrm{d}V} {\mathrm{d}h}$, etc.). Abuse Leibniz's notation to produce the required $\frac {\mathrm{d}V} {\mathrm{d}t}$. <!--SR:!2025-12-13,391,310-->

## solution

$$\begin{aligned}
V&=\frac\pi3\left(\frac{650}2\frac{h}{1500}\right)^2h\\
&=\frac\pi3\left(\frac{13}{60}h\right)^2h\\
&=\frac{169\pi}{10800}h^3\\
\frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}h}&=\frac{169\pi}{3600}h^2\\
\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}h}\frac{\mathrm{d}h}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)\Bigr|_{h=200}&=(20)\frac{169\pi}{3600}(200)^2\\
\frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}t}\Bigr|_{h=200}&=\frac{338000\pi}9\\
\mathrm{required\ answer}&=\frac{338000\pi}9+13000
\end{aligned}$$
