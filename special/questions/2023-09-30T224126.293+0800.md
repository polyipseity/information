# 2023-09-30T224126.293+0800

A force is defined by the potential energy function $U(x)=-2.5x^2+0.3x^3$. Find $a(x)$ for an object of mass 0.09 kg initially at rest at small $x$. Also, find the maximum $x$ reached. Assume all variables have standard SI units.

## strategy

- inspecting "A force is defined by the potential energy function $U(x)=-2.5x^2+0.3x^3$. Find $a(x)$ for an object of mass 0.09 kg initially at rest at small $x$." :@: Force is the derivative of the potential energy function with respect to $x$ (displacement). Then find acceleration from the force by $F = ma$. <!--SR:!2028-09-03,1128,310-->
- inspecting "A force is defined by the potential energy function $U(x)=-2.5x^2+0.3x^3$." and "Also, find the maximum $x$ reached." :@: Using intuition on potential energy, the next $x > 0$ such that $U(0) = U(x)$ is the maximum $x$ reached. <!--SR:!2028-07-11,989,290-->

## solution

$$\begin{aligned}
\int_0^x\!F(x)\,\mathrm{d}x&=-U(x)\\
\int_0^x\!a(x)\,\mathrm{d}x&=-\frac{U(x)}m\\
&=\frac{250}9x^2-\frac{10}3x^3\\
a(x)&=\frac{500}9x-10x^2\\
\\
U(0) & = U(x) \\
-\int_0^0 \! F(x) \,\mathrm{d}x & = -\int_0^x \! F(x) \,\mathrm{d}x \\
0 & = 2.5 x^2 - 0.3 x^3 \\
x&\in\left\{0,\frac{25}3\right\}\\
x_\mathrm{max}&=\frac{25}3\mathrm{\ m}
\end{aligned}$$
