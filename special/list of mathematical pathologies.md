## functions

### Dirichlet function

- see: [Dirichlet function](../general/Dirichlet%20function.md)

The [Dirichlet function](Dirichlet%20function.md) is {{$$f(x \in \mathbb{R}) = \begin{cases} 1 & x\text{ rational} \\ 0 & x\text{ irrational} \end{cases}$$}}.

- [continuity](../general/continuous%20function.md) and discontinuity ::: It is not continuous and discontinuous at every [real](../general/real%20number.md).
  - global continuity ::: It is a [discontinuous function](../general/continuous%20function.md).
- [limit of a function](../general/limit%20of%20a%20function.md) ::: It has no limit at every [real](../general/real%20number.md).

### empty function

- see: [function (mathematics)](../general/function%20(mathematics).md)

{{Every [set](../general/set%20(mathematics).md) $X$ has the unique [function](../general/function%20(mathematics).md) $\varnothing \to X$}} called the __empty function__.

- [continuity](../general/continuous%20function.md) and discontinuity ::: It is continuous and not discontinuous in its [domain](../general/domain%20of%20a%20function.md) by [vacuous truth](../general/vacuous%20truth.md).
  - global continuity ::: It is a [continuous function](../general/continuous%20function.md).
- [limit of a function](../general/limit%20of%20a%20function.md) ::: It has limit and it has no limit at every point in its [domain](../general/domain%20of%20a%20function.md) by [vacuous truth](../general/vacuous%20truth.md).
