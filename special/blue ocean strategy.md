# blue ocean strategy

## red ocean vs. blue ocean

Red ocean is about {@{competing in existing market space and exploiting existing demand}@}. {@{Either differentiation or low cost}@} can be satisfied.

Blue ocean is about {@{creating uncontested market space and capturing new demand}@}. {@{Both differentiation and low cost, i.e. value innovation}@}, can be satisfied simultaneously. Value innovation can be represented by {@{2 triangles pointing towards each other, with the 2 triangle tips overlapping in the middle}@}. The upper triangle represents {@{cost reduction while the lower triangle represents value creation}@}, with the overlap {@{representing satisfying both at the same time, hence value creation}@}.

## blue ocean shift

There are 3 steps to creating blue oceans: {@{understand "as-is", imagine "to be", and create "gap"}@}.

### understand "as-is"

In the 1st step, understand "as-is", the goal is to {@{understand where we are now}@}. You should {@{mobilize your team and understand your industry}@}.

To visualize the industry, one can make use of a {@{capture strategy canvas}@}. It is {@{a line chart}@} showing the {@{feature qualities of various offerings of your industry}@}. Ideally, after finishing all the 3 steps, you should also plot {@{your own blue ocean offering}@}, of which {@{some of the features should be respectively eliminated, reduced, raise, or create}@}. This will be mentioned in [§ create "gap"](#create%20"gap") again.

### imagine "to be"

In the 2nd step, imagine "to be", the goal is to {@{imagine where we could be}@}. You should {@{understand pains and look for non-customers}@}.

To understand pains, we can use {@{a customer journey map, which is similar to a [buyer utility map](buyer%20utility%20map.md) but with the column headers replaced with custom steps}@}. Only {@{note down the customer pains}@} on the map, and then {@{prioritize some customer pains by making them red}@}. Finally, {@{decide which pains are worth-solving by reducing or eliminating existing features}@}.

To look for non-customers, we can {@{separate the non-customers into 3 tiers: soon-to-be, refusing, and unexplored}@}. Identify {@{current market's customer}@} first, then identify the non-customers. Soon-to-be non-customers are {@{customers that are waiting to jump ship when a better offering appears}@}. Refusing non-customers are {@{customers consciously not using your market's offerings}@}. Unexplored non-customers are {@{customers in very distant markets, making them not considered by the current market at all}@}.

### create "gap"

In the 3rd step, create "gap", the goal is to {@{create your new strategic move}@}. You should use {@{6 paths to reconstruct and create a new business model using ERRC}@}.

{@{The 6 paths to reconstruct market boundaries}@} are {@{considering alternative industries, considering strategic groups in the current industry, finding buyers across the value chain or redefining buyers}@}, {@{considering complementary offerings, functional—emotional reorientation, and participating in industry trends}@}.

To create a new business model, use {@{eliminate, reduce, raise, and create (ERRC)}@}. These are the 4 actions one can take. After writing the things to be ERRC-ed, {@{go back to the capture strategy canvas in [§ understand "as-is"](#understand%20"as-is")}@}. Plot {@{the features of your new business model}@}. Note that {@{eliminated features should be 0 for the new business model, and created features are added to the canvas and are 0 for existing business models}@}. If possible, {@{order the features in the order of eliminated, reduced, raised, and then created features}@}.
