# blue ocean strategy

## red ocean vs. blue ocean

Red ocean is about {@{competing in existing market space and exploiting existing demand}@}. {@{Either differentiation or low cost}@} can be satisfied. <!--SR:!2025-12-20,372,290!2026-05-30,525,310-->

Blue ocean is about {@{creating uncontested market space and capturing new demand}@}. {@{Both differentiation and low cost, i.e. value innovation}@}, can be satisfied simultaneously. Value innovation can be represented by {@{2 triangles pointing towards each other, with the 2 triangle tips overlapping in the middle}@}. The upper triangle represents {@{cost reduction while the lower triangle represents value creation}@}, with the overlap {@{representing satisfying both at the same time, hence value creation}@}. <!--SR:!2027-02-19,742,330!2026-02-03,400,290!2030-05-08,1694,364!2030-01-19,1604,364!2029-11-22,1557,364-->

## blue ocean shift

There are 3 steps to creating blue oceans: {@{understand "as-is", imagine "to be", and create "gap"}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-12,497,324-->

### understand "as-is"

In the 1st step, understand "as-is", the goal is to {@{understand where we are now}@}. You should {@{mobilize your team and understand your industry}@}. <!--SR:!2030-05-03,1689,364!2030-01-03,1590,364-->

To visualize the industry, one can make use of a {@{capture strategy canvas}@}. It is {@{a line chart}@} showing the {@{feature qualities of various offerings of your industry}@}. Ideally, after finishing all the 3 steps, you should also plot {@{your own blue ocean offering}@}, of which {@{some of the features should be respectively eliminated, reduced, raise, or create}@}. This will be mentioned in [§ create "gap"](#create%20"gap") again. <!--SR:!2029-08-22,1428,324!2028-05-23,1086,344!2027-02-14,723,324!2027-10-29,879,304!2028-03-11,1038,344-->

### imagine "to be"

In the 2nd step, imagine "to be", the goal is to {@{imagine where we could be}@}. You should {@{understand pains and look for non-customers}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-18,1533,364!2026-05-22,475,304-->

To understand pains, we can use {@{a customer journey map, which is similar to a [buyer utility map](buyer%20utility%20map.md) but with the column headers replaced with custom steps}@}. Only {@{note down the customer pains}@} on the map, and then {@{prioritize some customer pains by making them red}@}. Finally, {@{decide which pains are worth-solving by reducing or eliminating existing features}@}. <!--SR:!2027-07-02,801,304!2026-10-18,601,304!2028-12-05,1180,304!2028-07-20,1140,344-->

To look for non-customers, we can {@{separate the non-customers into 3 tiers: soon-to-be, refusing, and unexplored}@}. Identify {@{current market's customer}@} first, then identify the non-customers. Soon-to-be non-customers are {@{customers that are waiting to jump ship when a better offering appears}@}. Refusing non-customers are {@{customers consciously not using your market's offerings}@}. Unexplored non-customers are {@{customers in very distant markets, making them not considered by the current market at all}@}. <!--SR:!2028-05-24,1087,344!2029-11-15,1556,364!2027-01-03,691,324!2028-01-01,997,344!2026-03-27,444,304-->

### create "gap"

In the 3rd step, create "gap", the goal is to {@{create your new strategic move}@}. You should use {@{6 paths to reconstruct and create a new business model using ERRC}@}. <!--SR:!2029-12-11,1576,364!2028-05-07,1070,344-->

{@{The 6 paths to reconstruct market boundaries}@} are {@{considering alternative industries, considering strategic groups in the current industry, finding buyers across the value chain or redefining buyers}@}, {@{considering complementary offerings, functional—emotional reorientation, and participating in industry trends}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-24,122,224!2026-03-21,143,337!2026-08-19,280,377-->

To {@{create a new business model}@}, use {@{eliminate, reduce, raise, and create \(ERRC\)}@}. These are {@{the 4 actions one can take}@}. After {@{writing the things to be ERRC-ed}@}, go back to {@{the capture strategy canvas in [§ understand "as-is"](#understand%20"as-is")}@}. Plot {@{the features of your new business model}@}. Note that {@{eliminated features}@} are {@{0 for the new business model}@}, and {@{created features}@} are {@{added to the canvas and are 0 for existing business models}@}. If possible, {@{order the features}@} in the order of {@{eliminated, reduced, raised, and then created features}@}. <!--SR:!2028-05-06,1069,344!2029-10-25,1538,364!2027-01-07,700,324!2028-11-06,1166,344!2028-05-14,1077,344!2025-12-30,96,377!2026-01-02,99,377!2025-12-29,95,377!2025-12-31,97,377!2025-12-30,96,377!2025-12-31,97,377!2026-01-01,98,377-->
