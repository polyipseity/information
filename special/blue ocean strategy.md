# blue ocean strategy

## red ocean vs. blue ocean

Red ocean is about {@{competing in existing market space and exploiting existing demand}@}. {@{Either differentiation or low cost}@} can be satisfied. <!--SR:!2025-12-20,372,290!2026-05-30,525,310-->

Blue ocean is about {@{creating uncontested market space and capturing new demand}@}. {@{Both differentiation and low cost, i.e. value innovation}@}, can be satisfied simultaneously. Value innovation can be represented by {@{2 triangles pointing towards each other, with the 2 triangle tips overlapping in the middle}@}. The upper triangle represents {@{cost reduction while the lower triangle represents value creation}@}, with the overlap {@{representing satisfying both at the same time, hence value creation}@}. <!--SR:!2027-02-19,742,330!2026-02-03,400,290!2025-09-17,358,344!2025-08-29,339,344!2025-08-15,330,344-->

## blue ocean shift

There are 3 steps to creating blue oceans: {@{understand "as-is", imagine "to be", and create "gap"}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-12,497,324-->

### understand "as-is"

In the 1st step, understand "as-is", the goal is to {@{understand where we are now}@}. You should {@{mobilize your team and understand your industry}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-17,357,344!2025-08-26,336,344-->

To visualize the industry, one can make use of a {@{capture strategy canvas}@}. It is {@{a line chart}@} showing the {@{feature qualities of various offerings of your industry}@}. Ideally, after finishing all the 3 steps, you should also plot {@{your own blue ocean offering}@}, of which {@{some of the features should be respectively eliminated, reduced, raise, or create}@}. This will be mentioned in [ยง create "gap"](#create%20"gap") again. <!--SR:!2025-09-24,338,304!2025-05-19,242,324!2025-02-21,172,304!2025-05-20,222,284!2025-05-07,232,324-->

### imagine "to be"

In the 2nd step, imagine "to be", the goal is to {@{imagine where we could be}@}. You should {@{understand pains and look for non-customers}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-07,324,344!2026-05-22,475,304-->

To understand pains, we can use {@{a customer journey map, which is similar to a [buyer utility map](buyer%20utility%20map.md) but with the column headers replaced with custom steps}@}. Only {@{note down the customer pains}@} on the map, and then {@{prioritize some customer pains by making them red}@}. Finally, {@{decide which pains are worth-solving by reducing or eliminating existing features}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-22,203,284!2025-02-24,152,284!2025-09-12,298,284!2025-06-06,255,324-->

To look for non-customers, we can {@{separate the non-customers into 3 tiers: soon-to-be, refusing, and unexplored}@}. Identify {@{current market's customer}@} first, then identify the non-customers. Soon-to-be non-customers are {@{customers that are waiting to jump ship when a better offering appears}@}. Refusing non-customers are {@{customers consciously not using your market's offerings}@}. Unexplored non-customers are {@{customers in very distant markets, making them not considered by the current market at all}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-25,243,324!2025-08-12,328,344!2025-02-11,164,304!2025-04-09,223,324!2026-03-27,444,304-->

### create "gap"

In the 3rd step, create "gap", the goal is to {@{create your new strategic move}@}. You should use {@{6 paths to reconstruct and create a new business model using ERRC}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-18,333,344!2025-05-14,238,324-->

The 6 paths to reconstruct market boundaries are {@{considering alternative industries, considering strategic groups in the current industry, finding buyers across the value chain or redefining buyers, considering complementary offerings, functional-emotional reorientation, and participating in industry trends}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-24,243,244-->

To create a new business model, use {@{eliminate, reduce, raise, and create (ERRC)}@}. These are the 4 actions one can take. After writing the things to be ERRC-ed, {@{go back to the capture strategy canvas in [ยง understand "as-is"](#understand%20"as-is")}@}. Plot {@{the features of your new business model}@}. Note that {@{eliminated features should be 0 for the new business model, and created features are added to the canvas and are 0 for existing business models}@}. If possible, {@{order the features in the order of eliminated, reduced, raised, and then created features}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,239,324!2025-08-09,325,344!2027-01-07,700,324!2025-08-28,338,344!2025-05-23,241,324-->
