# market segmentation

## why

Business {@{may not be able to satisfy all of their customers}@}. There are few products that {@{appeal to everyone}@}. Segmentation allows {@{the customer needs and wants to be similar enough for our product to target}@}.

## how

A market segment is {@{a group of customers sharing the same interest, traits, and characteristics}@}. Effective segmentation requires {@{measurability}@}, {@{the ability to gather concrete information on the segment}@}; {@{substantiality}@}, {@{the profitability of the segment, affected by attractiveness or stickiness of products}@}; {@{accessibility}@}, {@{how reachable and servable the segment is}@}; and {@{actionability}@}, {@{feasibility for the company}@}.

### segmentation variables

Traditional variables include {@{[demographic](#demographic%20segmentation), [geographic](#geographic%20segmentation), [psychographic](#psychographic-segmentation), [behavioral](#behavioral-segmentation), and [product-specific](#product-specific%20segmentation)}@}.

#### demographic segmentation

Demographic segmentation divides the market by {@{factual and physical data}@}.

#### geographic segmentation

Geographic segmentation divides the market by {@{location-related variables}@}.

#### psychographic segmentation

Psychographic segmentation divides the market by {@{interests, lifestyles, motives, personality, and values}@}.

#### behavioral segmentation

Behavioral segmentation divides the market by {@{individual purchase behaviors}@}.

#### product-specific segmentation

Product-specific segmentation divides the market by {@{product or service-specific factors}@}.

## benefits

By segmenting the market, business {@{can clarify the requirements of their customers and tailor to them}@}. Strategy-wise, we can identify {@{the most profitable and least profitable customers, and the size of the market}@}. Marketers can {@{focus their effort}@}.

## strategy

It is necessary for the company to decide {@{which segments to serve}@}. It can be {@{undifferentiated, ignoring segments; concentrated or focused, one segment; differentiated, two or more segments; or hypersegmented, thousands of or more segments}@}.

Undifferentiated marketing is {@{rare because customers are demanding nowadays}@}. Differentiated marketing is {@{used by most companies, but it incurs a greater cost than undifferentiated marketing}@}. Some companies use focused marketing, which {@{usually has high rate of return but also higher risk}@}. For startups, {@{focused marketing is more suitable as the cost is lower than differentiated marketing}@}. Hypersegmented marketing is {@{rather new and used by companies with data of individual customers. However, there are privacy concerns with this use of individual data}@}.
