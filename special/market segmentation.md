# market segmentation

## how

A market segment is {{a group of customers sharing the same interest, traits, and characteristics}}. Effective segmentation requires {{measurability, the ability to gather concrete information on the segment; substantiality, the profitability of the segment; accessibility, how reachable and servable the segment is; and actionability, feasibility for the company}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-04,19,250!2024-06-13,45,250-->

### segmentation variables

Traditional variables include {{[demographic](#demographic%20segmentation), [geographic](#geographic%20segmentation), [psychographic](#psychographic-segmentation), [behavioral](#behavioral-segmentation), and [product-specific](#product-specific%20segmentation)}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-10,44,250-->

#### demographic segmentation

#### geographic segmentation

## benefits

Business {{may not be able to satisfy all of their customers}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-22,35,270-->

By segmenting the market, marketers {{can better understand and tailor to their customers}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-01,42,290-->

## strategy

It is necessary for the company to decide {{which segments to serve}}. It can be {{undifferentiated, ignoring segments; concentrated or focused, one segment; differentiated, two or more segments; or hypersegmented, thousands of or more segments}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-07,46,290!2024-05-07,9,230-->

Undifferentiated marketing is {{rare because customers are demanding nowadays}}. Differentiated marketing is {{used by most companies, but it incurs a greater cost than undifferentiated marketing}}. Some companies use focused marketing, which {{usually has high rate of return but also higher risk}}. For startups, {{focused marketing is more suitable as the cost is lower than differentiated marketing}}. Hypersegmented marketing is {{rather new and used by companies with data of individual customers. However, there are privacy concerns with this use of individual data}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-06,28,270!2024-05-19,32,270!2024-06-13,56,310!2024-06-02,43,290!2024-05-17,39,270-->
