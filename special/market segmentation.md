# market segmentation

## why

Business {{may not be able to satisfy all of their customers}}. There are few products that {{appeal to everyone}}. Segmentation allows {{the customer needs and wants to be similar enough for our product to target}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-18,132,305!2024-12-31,163,305!2025-02-18,201,325-->

## how

A market segment is {{a group of customers sharing the same interest, traits, and characteristics}}. Effective segmentation requires {{measurability, the ability to gather concrete information on the segment; substantiality, the profitability of the segment, affected by attractiveness or stickiness of products; accessibility, how reachable and servable the segment is; and actionability, feasibility for the company}}. <!--SR:!2025-12-09,418,270!2025-07-22,287,250-->

### segmentation variables

Traditional variables include {{[demographic](#demographic%20segmentation), [geographic](#geographic%20segmentation), [psychographic](#psychographic-segmentation), [behavioral](#behavioral-segmentation), and [product-specific](#product-specific%20segmentation)}}. <!--SR:!2025-07-04,277,250-->

#### demographic segmentation

Demographic segmentation divides the market by {{factual and physical data}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-15,178,270-->

#### geographic segmentation

Geographic segmentation divides the market by {{location-related variables}}. <!--SR:!2026-04-02,532,310-->

#### psychographic segmentation

Psychographic segmentation divides the market by {{interests, lifestyles, motives, personality, and values}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-26,46,230-->

#### behavioral segmentation

Behavioral segmentation divides the market by {{individual purchase behaviors}}. <!--SR:!2025-11-27,450,310-->

#### product-specific segmentation

Product-specific segmentation divides the market by {{product or service-specific factors}}. <!--SR:!2025-12-09,411,290-->

## benefits

By segmenting the market, business {{can clarify the requirements of their customers and tailor to them}}. Strategy-wise, we can identify {{the most profitable and least profitable customers, and the size of the market}}. Marketers can {{focus their effort}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-16,168,310!2025-08-28,344,305!2025-01-31,188,325-->

## strategy

It is necessary for the company to decide {{which segments to serve}}. It can be {{undifferentiated, ignoring segments; concentrated or focused, one segment; differentiated, two or more segments; or hypersegmented, thousands of or more segments}}. <!--SR:!2026-04-02,532,310!2025-01-18,167,250-->

Undifferentiated marketing is {{rare because customers are demanding nowadays}}. Differentiated marketing is {{used by most companies, but it incurs a greater cost than undifferentiated marketing}}. Some companies use focused marketing, which {{usually has high rate of return but also higher risk}}. For startups, {{focused marketing is more suitable as the cost is lower than differentiated marketing}}. Hypersegmented marketing is {{rather new and used by companies with data of individual customers. However, there are privacy concerns with this use of individual data}}. <!--SR:!2025-04-27,280,290!2025-08-31,346,290!2025-02-07,239,330!2024-11-22,172,310!2025-06-06,277,270-->
