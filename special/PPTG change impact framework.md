# PPTG change impact framework

An [operating model](../general/operating%20model.md) of an organization is commonly defined to be {@{_people_, _process_, and _technology_, and optionally _governance_}@}. Making a change in an organization will {@{impact these 4 elements together}@}, so the PPTG change impact framework can help visualize this.

## the framework

The framework consists of 4 aspects: {@{_people_, _process_, _technology_, and _governance_}@}.

- _people_ ::@:: how hiring, organization structure, people, roles, skills, etc. change
- _process_ ::@:: how internal and external organization activities change
- _technology_ ::@:: technologies necessary for the change
- _governance_ ::@:: key performance indicators (KPIs), persons responsible for collecting the KPIs, and interpretation of the KPIs

## extensions

After identifying the PPTG change impacts, we can {@{act to support said change impacts}@}. {@{A table}@} can be used: for each aspect, write down {@{actions to support change, who, and budget}@}. Other things can also be added.
