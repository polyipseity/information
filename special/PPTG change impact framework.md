# PPTG change impact framework

An [operating model](../general/operating%20model.md) of an organization is commonly defined to be {@{_people_, _process_, and _technology_, and optionally _governance_}@}. Making a change in an organization will {@{impact these 4 elements together}@}, so the PPTG change impact framework can help visualize this. <!--SR:!2025-06-04,278,330!2025-01-24,161,310-->

## the framework

The framework consists of 4 aspects: {@{_people_, _process_, _technology_, and _governance_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,304,330-->

- _people_ ::@:: how hiring, organization structure, people, roles, skills, etc. change <!--SR:!2026-01-26,397,290!2026-04-13,501,310-->
- _process_ ::@:: how internal and external organization activities change <!--SR:!2025-02-11,176,310!2026-01-15,428,310-->
- _technology_ ::@:: technologies necessary for the change <!--SR:!2025-12-25,372,290!2025-05-02,252,330-->
- _governance_ ::@:: key performance indicators (KPIs), persons responsible for collecting the KPIs, and interpretation of the KPIs <!--SR:!2026-04-08,468,310!2025-06-29,300,330-->

## extensions

After identifying the PPTG change impacts, we can {@{act to support said change impacts}@}. {@{A table}@} can be used: for each aspect, write down {@{actions to support change, who, and budget}@}. Other things can also be added. <!--SR:!2025-06-03,278,330!2026-11-10,665,330!2026-05-08,514,310-->
