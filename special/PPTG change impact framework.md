# PPTG change impact framework

An [operating model](../general/operating%20model.md) of an organization is commonly defined to be {{_people_, _process_, and _technology_, and optionally _governance_}}. Making a change in an organization will {{impact these 4 elements together}}, so the PPTG change impact framework can help visualize this. <!--SR:!2024-06-26,17,290!2024-06-23,14,290-->

## the framework

The framework consists of 4 aspects: {{_people_, _process_, _technology_, and _governance_}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-26,17,290-->

- _people_ ::: how hiring, organization structure, people, roles, skills, etc. change <!--SR:!2024-06-26,17,290!2024-07-24,33,270-->
- _process_ ::: how internal and external organization activities change <!--SR:!2024-06-23,14,290!2024-06-23,14,290-->
- _technology_ ::: technologies necessary for the change <!--SR:!2024-06-25,16,290!2024-06-24,15,290-->
- _governance_ ::: key performance indicators (KPIs), persons responsible for collecting the KPIs, and interpretation of the KPIs <!--SR:!2024-07-28,39,290!2024-06-26,17,290-->

## extensions

After identifying the PPTG change impacts, we can {{act to support said change impacts}}. {{A table}} can be used: for each aspect, write down {{actions to support change, who, and budget}}. Other things can also be added. <!--SR:!2024-06-25,16,290!2024-06-22,13,290!2024-08-04,44,290-->
