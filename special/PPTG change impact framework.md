# PPTG change impact framework

An [operating model](../general/operating%20model.md) of an organization is commonly defined to be {{_people_, _process_, and _technology_, and optionally _governance_}}. Making a change in an organization will {{impact these 4 elements together}}, so the PPTG change impact framework can help visualize this. <!--SR:!2024-08-30,65,310!2024-08-15,53,310-->

## the framework

The framework consists of 4 aspects: {{_people_, _process_, _technology_, and _governance_}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-05,71,310-->

- _people_ ::: how hiring, organization structure, people, roles, skills, etc. change <!--SR:!2024-08-12,47,290!2024-11-28,124,290-->
- _process_ ::: how internal and external organization activities change <!--SR:!2024-08-19,57,310!2024-07-30,37,290-->
- _technology_ ::: technologies necessary for the change <!--SR:!2024-08-09,45,290!2024-08-23,59,310-->
- _governance_ ::: key performance indicators (KPIs), persons responsible for collecting the KPIs, and interpretation of the KPIs <!--SR:!2024-07-28,39,290!2024-09-02,68,310-->

## extensions

After identifying the PPTG change impacts, we can {{act to support said change impacts}}. {{A table}} can be used: for each aspect, write down {{actions to support change, who, and budget}}. Other things can also be added. <!--SR:!2024-08-29,65,310!2024-08-12,51,310!2024-08-04,44,290-->
