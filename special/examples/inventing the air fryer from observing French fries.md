# inventing the air fryer from observing French fries

How might one invent the [air fryer](../../general/air%20fryer.md) from observing [French fries](../../general/French%20fries.md)?

One may start by considering {{assumptions of making French fries}}: {{It requires frying with a lot of oil.}} Then, we can think of a {{problem statement going against the assumptions}}: {{How to make tasty French fries without frying?}} <!--SR:!2024-10-04,115,290!2024-06-16,38,290!2024-09-21,106,290!2024-06-25,43,290-->

With the problem statement in mind, identify {{what makes French fries tasty}}. They {{have a crunchy exterior, and a light and fluffy interior}}. Next, realize that {{to make the exterior crunchier}}, {{remove moisture from potatoes faster by transferring heat very quickly}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-19,105,290!2024-09-11,91,270!2024-10-03,116,290!2024-08-30,90,290-->

To remove moisture from potatoes faster by transferring heat quickly, the conventional way of {{dipping the French fries in oil}} works. But with creativity, we could also {{use very hot air surrounding potatoes}}, then much less or no oil is needed. <!--SR:!2024-09-08,99,290!2024-06-13,33,270-->

A lot of research later, the air fryer is invented. It uses the principles of {{circulation of hot air, convection, and radiation}}. It {{distinguishes itself}} from prior art as it {{uses much less oil, making the French fries healthier; easy to clean and dispose oil; and safer as there is no high temperature flammable oil}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-04,42,250!2024-06-14,34,270!2024-08-25,77,270-->
