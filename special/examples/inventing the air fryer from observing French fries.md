# inventing the air fryer from observing French fries

How might one invent the [air fryer](../../general/air%20fryer.md) from observing [French fries](../../general/French%20fries.md)?

One may start by considering {@{assumptions of making French fries}@}: {@{It requires frying with a lot of oil.}@} Then, we can think of a {@{problem statement going against the assumptions}@}: {@{How to make tasty French fries without frying?}@} <!--SR:!2026-01-12,461,310!2024-11-14,151,310!2025-11-24,426,310!2024-12-14,172,310-->

With the problem statement in mind, identify {@{what makes French fries tasty}@}. They {@{have a crunchy exterior, and a light and fluffy interior}@}. Next, realize that {@{to make the exterior crunchier}@}, {@{remove moisture from potatoes faster by transferring heat very quickly}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,424,310!2025-08-21,344,290!2026-01-12,466,310!2025-08-27,362,310-->

To remove moisture from potatoes faster by transferring heat quickly, the conventional way of {@{dipping the French fries in oil}@} works. But with creativity, we could also {@{use very hot air surrounding potatoes}@}, then much less or no oil is needed. <!--SR:!2025-10-12,398,310!2026-03-28,526,310-->

A lot of research later, the air fryer is invented. It uses the principles of {@{circulation of hot air, convection, and radiation}@}. It {@{distinguishes itself}@} from prior art as it {@{uses much less oil, making the French fries healthier; easy to clean and dispose oil; and safer as there is no high temperature flammable oil}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-04,383,270!2026-04-05,533,310!2025-03-22,207,270-->
