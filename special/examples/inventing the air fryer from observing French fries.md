# inventing the air fryer from observing French fries

How might one invent the [air fryer](../../general/air%20fryer.md) from observing [French fries](../../general/French%20fries.md)?

One may start by considering {{assumptions of making French fries}}: {{It requires frying with a lot of oil.}} Then, we can think of a {{problem statement going against the assumptions}}: {{How to make tasty French fries without frying?}} <!--SR:!2024-05-10,12,270!2024-05-09,11,270!2024-05-09,11,270!2024-05-12,14,290-->

With the problem statement in mind, identify {{what makes French fries tasty}}. They {{have a crunchy exterior, and a light and fluffy interior}}. Next, realize that {{to make the exterior crunchier}}, {{remove moisture from potatoes faster by transferring heat very quickly}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-09,11,270!2024-05-08,10,250!2024-05-08,10,270!2024-05-07,9,270-->

To remove moisture from potatoes faster by transferring heat quickly, the conventional way of {{dipping the French fries in oil is}} works. But with creativity, we could also {{use very hot air surrounding potatoes}}, then much less or no oil is needed. <!--SR:!2024-05-05,7,250!2024-05-11,13,270-->

A lot of research later, the air fryer is invented. It uses the principles of {{circulation of hot air, convection, and radiation}}. It {{distinguishes itself}} from prior art as it {{uses much less oil, making the French fries healthier; easy to clean and dispose oil; and safer as there is no high temperature flammable oil}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-05,7,250!2024-05-11,13,270!2024-05-10,12,270-->
