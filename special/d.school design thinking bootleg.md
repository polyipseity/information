# d.school design thinking bootleg

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../tools/utility.py.md
```

## process modules

There are 5 "modes" to design thinking. Note that the "mode" order is {@{only recommended and is not must be followed. In fact, the process is nonlinear, can start anywhere, and can be parallel}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-14,558,310-->

```Python
# pytextgen generate data

[define](#define) (green)
[ideate](#ideate) (yellow)

### empathize

Empathy is {@{the foundation of human-centered design}@}. To empathize: {@{observe, view users and their behaviors in their lives; engage, interact and interview users in scheduled or short intercept counters; and immerse, experience in users' shoes for some time}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-21,616,310!2027-03-14,647,250-->

### define

Define is {@{unpacking your findings from empathize into insights, and coming up with your _Point of View_}@}. A _Point of View_ should {@{preserve emotions and the individuals you are designing for. Language should be strong but sensible. The goal is to generate many possibilities}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-31,492,270!2032-02-09,2184,330-->

### ideate

Ideate is {@{generating _radical_ design alternatives, going wild with your imagination}@}. While ideating, it is also important to curtail {@{bad behaviors, like evaluating ideas}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-25,490,270!2026-12-01,741,330-->

### prototype

Prototype is {@{making your idea physical}@}. In early stages, {@{keep the prototypes inexpensive to reiterate quickly}@}. Ideally, the prototypes are {@{interactive}@}. <!--SR:!2026-11-01,664,290!2029-04-30,1351,310!2028-05-13,1169,350-->

### test

Test is {@{testing your idea, gather feedback, and reiterate your design}@}. It is different from prototype that {@{prototype finds success in your design while test finds failure}@}. <!--SR:!2027-01-20,781,330!2026-12-19,664,290-->
