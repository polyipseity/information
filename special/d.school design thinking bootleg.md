# d.school design thinking bootleg

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../tools/utility.py.md
```

## process modules

There are 5 "modes" to design thinking. Note that the "mode" order is {@{only recommended and is not must be followed. In fact, the process is nonlinear, can start anywhere, and can be parallel}@}.

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("2e33", "8baa",),
  R"""
[empathize](#empathize) (blue)
[define](#define) (green)
[ideate](#ideate) (yellow)
[prototype](#prototype) (red)
[test](#test) (brown)
""".strip().splitlines(),
)
```

### empathize

Empathy is {@{the foundation of human-centered design}@}. To empathize: {@{observe, view users and their behaviors in their lives; engage, interact and interview users in scheduled or short intercept counters; and immerse, experience in users' shoes for some time}@}.

### define

Define is {@{unpacking your findings from empathize into insights, and coming up with your _Point of View_}@}. A _Point of View_ should {@{preserve emotions and the individuals you are designing for. Language should be strong but sensible. The goal is to generate many possibilities}@}.

### ideate

Ideate is {@{generating _radical_ design alternatives, going wild with your imagination}@}. While ideating, it is also important to curtail {@{bad behaviors, like evaluating ideas}@}.

### prototype

Prototype is {@{making your idea physical}@}. In early stages, {@{keep the prototypes inexpensive to reiterate quickly}@}. Ideally, the prototypes are {@{interactive}@}.

### test

Test is {@{testing your idea, gather feedback, and reiterate your design}@}. It is different from prototype that {@{prototype finds success in your design while test finds failure}@}.

(empathize) assume a beginner's mindset
