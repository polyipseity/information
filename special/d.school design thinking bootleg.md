# d.school design thinking bootleg

## process modules

There are 5 "modes" to design thinking. Note that the "mode" order is {{only recommended and is not must be followed. In fact, the process is nonlinear}}. <!--SR:!2024-04-21,16,290-->

### empathize

Empathy is {{the foundation of human-centered design}}. To empathize: {{observe, view users and their behaviors in their lives; engage, interact and interview users in scheduled or short intercept counters; and immerse, experience in users' shoes for some time}}. <!--SR:!2024-04-22,17,290!2024-04-26,15,250-->

### define

Define is {{unpacking your findings from empathize into insights, and coming up with your _Point of View_}}. A _Point of View_ should {{preserve emotions and the individuals you are designing for. Language should be strong but sensible. The goal is to generate many possibilities}}. <!--SR:!2024-04-13,8,250!2024-04-18,13,270-->

### ideate

Ideate is {{generating _radical_ design alternatives, going wild with your imagination}}. While ideating, it is also important to curtail {{bad behaviors, like evaluating ideas}}. <!--SR:!2024-04-14,9,250!2024-04-19,14,290-->

### prototype

Prototype is {{making your idea physical}}. In early stages, {{keep the prototypes inexpensive to reiterate quickly}}. Ideally, the prototypes are {{interactive}}. <!--SR:!2024-04-14,9,270!2024-04-17,12,270!2024-04-19,14,290-->

### test

Test is {{testing your idea, gather feedback, and reiterate your design}}. It is different from prototype that {{prototype finds success in your design while test finds failure}}. <!--SR:!2024-04-16,11,270!2024-04-14,9,270-->

## methods and tools

  R"""
(empathize) assume a beginner's mindset
(empathize) extreme users: find amplified pains and gains
(empathize) interview for empathy: interview with two
(empathize) interview preparation: prepare, prioritize, and refine questions
(empathize) what, how, why: from the concrete to the abstract
(empathize/define) journey map: dissect a user process to gain insights
(empathize/define) story share-and-capture: after interviews, exchange stories with the team to gain further insights
(define) 2×2 matrix: plot a _xy_ graph to reveal relations and for visualization
(define) design guidelines: a strategy to solve your design challenge, abstract enough to allow for multiple solutions
(define) point of view (POV): make your design challenge into an actionable statement
(define) why-how laddering: from need, asking "Why?" to follow the chain of reasoning to the root need, and then find other needs by asking "How?" to follow back down the chain
(define/ideate) "how might we" questions: questions to stimulate ideation that are suitably narrow and suitably board
(define/ideate) powers of ten: change the scale by orders of magnitude
