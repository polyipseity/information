# d.school design thinking bootleg

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../tools/utility.py.md
```

## process modules

There are 5 "modes" to design thinking. Note that the "mode" order is {{only recommended and is not must be followed. In fact, the process is nonlinear, can start anywhere, and can be parallel}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-03,180,310-->

### empathize

Empathy is {{the foundation of human-centered design}}. To empathize: {{observe, view users and their behaviors in their lives; engage, interact and interview users in scheduled or short intercept counters; and immerse, experience in users' shoes for some time}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-12,152,290!2024-09-19,104,250-->

### define

Define is {{unpacking your findings from empathize into insights, and coming up with your _Point of View_}}. A _Point of View_ should {{preserve emotions and the individuals you are designing for. Language should be strong but sensible. The goal is to generate many possibilities}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-05,57,250!2024-09-25,126,290-->

### ideate

Ideate is {{generating _radical_ design alternatives, going wild with your imagination}}. While ideating, it is also important to curtail {{bad behaviors, like evaluating ideas}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-04,56,250!2024-11-20,172,310-->

### prototype

Prototype is {{making your idea physical}}. In early stages, {{keep the prototypes inexpensive to reiterate quickly}}. Ideally, the prototypes are {{interactive}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-12,64,270!2024-09-15,116,290!2024-06-18,60,310-->

### test

Test is {{testing your idea, gather feedback, and reiterate your design}}. It is different from prototype that {{prototype finds success in your design while test finds failure}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-29,182,310!2024-07-09,61,270-->

(empathize) assume a beginner's mindset

(empathize) interview for empathy: interview with two
(empathize) interview preparation: prepare, prioritize, and refine questions
(empathize) what, how, why: from the concrete to the abstract
(empathize/define) journey map: dissect a user process to gain insights

(define) why-how laddering: from need, asking "Why?" to follow the chain of reasoning to the root need, and then find other needs by asking "How?" to follow back down the chain
