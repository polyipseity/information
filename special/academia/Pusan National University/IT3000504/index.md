- topic: measuring a nation's income
- [microeconomics](../../../../general/microeconomics.md) ::@:: It is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources and the interactions among these individuals and firms.
  - microeconomics / vs. macroeconomics ::@:: Microeconomics focuses on the study of individual markets, sectors, or industries as opposed to the economy as a whole, which is studied in macroeconomics.
- macroeconomics
  - macroeconomics / vs. microeconomics
- [gross domestic product](../../../../general/gross%20domestic%20product.md) \(GDP\) ::@:: It is a monetary measure of the total market value of all the final goods and services produced and rendered in a specific time period by a country or countries.
  - gross domestic product / measure ::@:: GDP is often used to measure the economic activity of a country or region.
  - gross domestic product / income ::@:: Theoretically, income equals expenditure, because a dollar spent by one is another dollar received by the other. <p> So it also measures the total income of everyone in a specific time period by a country.
- [circular flow of income](../../../../general/circular%20flow%20of%20income.md) ::@:: It is a model of the economy in which the major exchanges are represented as flows of money, goods and services, etc. between economic agents. <p> The circular flow analysis is the basis of national accounts and hence of macroeconomics.
  - circular flow of income / flows ::@:: The flows of money and goods exchanged in a closed circuit correspond in value, but run in the opposite direction.
  - circular flow of income / two-sector model ::@:: In the basic two-sector circular flow of income model, the economy consists of two sectors: \(1\) households and \(2\) firms.
    - circular flow of income / two-sector model / flows ::@:: All household expenditures become income for firms. The firms then spend all of this income on factors of production such as labor, capital and raw materials, "transferring" all of their <!-- utkarsh --> income to the factor owners \(which are households\). The factor owners \(households\), in turn, spend all of their income on goods, which leads to a circular flow of income.
    - circular flow of income / two-sector model / missing sectors ::@:: The model assumes that there is no financial sector \(borrowing, lending, saving, etc.\), no government sector \(government purchases, taxes, etc.\), and no foreign sector \(currencies, exports, financial assets, imports, etc.\).
- gross domestic product
  - gross domestic product / keywords ::@:: domestic production, final, market value, time period, goods and services
    - gross domestic product / keywords / market value ::@:: Use the market value of goods and services measured in the same unit \(currency\). Goods and services without market value are excluded.
    - gross domestic product / keywords / final ::@:: Final goods and services are intended for end users \(households\). Intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year.
    - gross domestic product / keywords / goods and services ::@:: Goods are usually _tangible_. Services are usually _intangible_.
    - gross domestic product / keywords / domestic ::@:: Any production \(not consumption\) that occurs in a country counts, whether by citizens or foreigners.
    - gross domestic product / keywords / time period ::@:: Usually a year or a quarter \(3 months\).
  - gross domestic product / determination ::@:: GDP can be determined in three ways, all of which should, theoretically, give the same result. They are the production \(or output or value added\) approach, the income approach, and the speculated expenditure approach. It is representative of the total output and income within an economy.
    - gross domestic product / determination / expenditure ::@:: The third way to estimate GDP is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services \(all uses except intermediate consumption\) measured in purchasers' prices.
      - gross domestic product / determination / expenditure / unsold goods ::@:: Market goods that are produced are purchased by someone. In the case where a good is produced and unsold, the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves. Therefore, measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production. This is known as the expenditure method of calculating GDP.
      - gross domestic product / determination / expenditure / components ::@:: __GDP \(Y\)__ is the sum of __consumption \(C\)__, __investment \(I\)__, __government expenditures \(G\)__ and __net exports \(X − M\)__. <p> &emsp; __Y__ = __C__ + __I__ + __G__ + __\(X − M\)__
      - gross domestic product / determination / expenditure / consumption \(C\) ::@:: It consists of private expenditures in the economy \(household final consumption expenditure\). These personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories: durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. <p> Purchase of new housing is _excluded_. For renters, rent payments are included. For homeowners, only the imputed rental value \(a fictitious income amount\) is included, but not mortgage payments or purchase price.
      - gross domestic product / determination / expenditure / investment \(I\) ::@:: It includes, for instance, business investment in equipment \(annotation: buildings, equipment, inventory, etc.\), but does not include exchanges of existing assets. Spending by households \(not the government\) on new houses is also included in investment. <p> In contrast to its colloquial meaning, "investment" in GDP does not mean purchases related to financial investments. Buying financial products is classed as 'saving', as opposed to investment.
      - gross domestic product / determination / expenditure / government expenditures \(G\) ::@:: It is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services. It includes salaries of public servants, purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government. It does not include any transfer payments, such as social security or unemployment benefits.
      - gross domestic product / determination / expenditure / net exports \(NX\) ::@:: __X \(exports\)__ represents gross exports. GDP captures the amount a country produces, including goods and services produced for other nations' consumption, therefore exports are added. <p> __M \(imports\)__ represents gross imports. Imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms __G__, __I__, or __C__, and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic.
  - gross domestic product / examples ::@:: United States: 29.18 trillion USD \(2024\)
  - gross domestic product / per capita ::@:: GDP can be adjusted for population growth, also called _Per-capita GDP_ or _GDP per person_. This measures the average production of a person in the country.
    - gross domestic product / per capita / advantages ::@:: The major advantage of GDP per capita as an indicator of the standard of living is that it is measured frequently, widely, and consistently.
  - gross domestic product / nominal GDP ::@:: The raw GDP figure given by the equations above is called the nominal, historical, or current GDP.
  - gross domestic product / real GDP ::@:: The GDP adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real GDP.
    - gross domestic product / real GDP / motivations ::@:: When comparing GDP figures from one year to another, compensating for changes in the value of money—for the effects of inflation or deflation is desirable. To make it more meaningful for year-to-year comparisons, a nominal GDP may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the GDP was measured and the value of money in a base year.
    - gross domestic product / real GDP / base year ::@:: Prices of this year are used to compute the real GDP of all years. The nominal GDP of this year equals the real GDP via the definition.
