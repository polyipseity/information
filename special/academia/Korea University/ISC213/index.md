It also provides information about the outputs and inputs of each entity and the process itself. A data-flow diagram has no control flow — there are no decision rules and no loops. Specific operations based on the data can be represented by a flowchart. <!--SR:!2026-02-20,157,428!2026-02-07,146,428-->
  - data-flow diagram / characteristics ::@:: data dictionary \(specify contents of data flows and data stores\), process specifications, structured chart <!--SR:!2026-02-04,143,428!2026-02-12,150,428-->
  - data-flow diagram / components ::@:: data flow \(arrows\), process, warehouse, terminator \(e.g. entity, external entity, interface, etc.\) <p> \(__this course__: use _entity_ or _external entity_\) <!--SR:!2026-02-06,145,428!2026-02-05,144,428-->
  - data-flow diagram / reading ::@:: The boxes can be warehouses, processes, or terminators. There are \(probably\) many arrows with annotating text in between boxes. <p> Everything included is _inside_ the system's boundary. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,151,428!2026-02-06,145,428-->
- [object-oriented analysis and design](../../../../general/object-oriented%20analysis%20and%20design.md) \(OOAD\) ::@:: It is an approach to analyzing and designing a computer-based system by applying an object-oriented mindset and using visual modeling throughout the software development process. <!--SR:!2026-02-09,148,428!2026-02-06,145,428-->
  - object-oriented analysis and design / concepts ::@:: _Object_ is the basic unit. It combines data and processes operating on it. _Class_, \(represented by a box with its data and processes\) and _inheritance_ \(represented by arrows pointing from subclasses to parent classes\) are two important concepts. <!--SR:!2026-02-05,144,428!2026-02-04,143,428-->
  - object-oriented analysis and design / characteristics ::@:: iterative, incremental, reusable \(objects are reusable\); thus potentially reduces development cost and time <!--SR:!2026-02-21,158,428!2026-02-14,152,428-->

- [systems development life cycle](../../../../general/systems%20development%20life%20cycle.md) \(SDLC\) ::@:: It describes the typical phases and progression between phases during the development of a computer-based system; from inception to retirement. At base, there is just one life cycle even though there are different ways to describe it; using differing numbers of and names for the phases. <p> It is still often used for large complex systems. <!--SR:!2026-02-19,156,428!2026-02-03,142,428-->
