- topic: information systems, organizations, strategy
- [organization](../../../../general/organization.md) ::@:: It is an entity—such as a company, or corporation or an institution (formal organization), or an association—comprising one or more people and having a particular purpose.
  - organiZation / information technology ::@:: Organization and IT influences each other. Mediating factors include business processes, culture, environment, management, politics, structure, etc.
  - organiZation / technical definition ::@:: A _formal social_ structure that accepts _inputs_ from the _environment_ and _outputs_ back to the environment via _production processes_.
  - organiZation / behavioral definition ::@:: A collection of rights and obligations, and privileges and responsibilities that are balanced _over time_ through _conflict resolution_.
    - organization / behavior definition / conflict ::@:: They are divergent viewpoints about how resources, rewards, and punishments should be distributed, and the struggles resulting from them.
  - organiZation / structures ::@:: business processes, culture, division of labor, hierarchy, processes, rules
  - organiZation / processes ::@:: norms, people, privileges and responsibilities, rights and obligations, values
  - organiZation / features ::@:: accountability and authority, efficiency, hierarchy, routines \(i.e. standard operating procedures\), social aspects \(e.g. culture, environment, politics, etc.\)
  - organiZation / environment ::@:: Organizations and \(physical and social\) environments are open to and depend on each other. <p> Environments generally change faster than organizations. IS can help hasten environment scanning \(obtaining information from the environment\).
  - organiZation / types ::@:: according to Mintzberg: adhocracy, divisionalized, entrepreneurial, machine, professional
    - organiZation / types / entrepreneurial ::@:: A young, small firm managed by an entrepreneur for adapting to fast-changing environments <p> examples: small startups
    - organiZation / types / machine ::@:: Large bureaucracy working in slow-changing environments. Decision making and management is centralized. <p> examples: midsize manufacturing firms
    - organiZation / types / divisionalized ::@:: A combination of machine bureaucracies. All managed by a central headquarters. <p> examples: Fortune 500 firms, large firms
    - organiZation / types / professional ::@:: Knowledge-based organizations that value expertise and knowledge of professionals. Decision making and management is delegated to departments. <p> examples: hospitals, law firms, schools
    - organiZation / types / adhocracy ::@:: Firms consisting of _ad hoc_ task forces for adapting to fast-changing environments. A task force is short-lived, and consists of specialists across disciplines. Decision making and management is decentralized. <p> examples: consulting firms
  - organization / information system ::@:: IT can facilitate faster communication of information, reducing _agency costs_. It can also facilitate cheaper communication, reducing _transaction costs_. <p> As a result, IT can help _flatten_ organizations \(less hierarchical levels\), producing _postindustrial organizations_.
  - organization / agency theory ::@:: People in an organization are self-interested. As people \(agents\) in an organization often work on behalf of others \(principals\) bound by contracts, self-interests may misalign agents and principals, incurring _agency costs_. This is especially high when information or self-interests between agents and principals misalign.
  - organization / transaction cost theory ::@:: Many transactions occur in an organization. Each transaction may incur a _transaction cost_.
- [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) ::@:: They are what is used in the production process to produce output—that is, goods and services.
  - factors of production / factors ::@:: Land, labor, and capital are traditional factors. Entrepreneurship is a commonly added fourth factor. Knowledge \(e.g. information technology\) is a fifth factor proposed by Peter Drucker.

    - Porter's five forces analysis / internet / suppliers ::@:: Procurement over the internet reduces bargaining power of suppliers for similar reasons as customers \(because you become the customer for suppliers\). <p> Separately, suppliers benefit from elimination of intermediaries and reduced barriers to entry due to the internet.
    - Porter's five forces analysis / internet / entrants ::@:: Internet reduces barriers to entry in general, as many business processes, e.g. channels, marketing, sales, can be shifted online. And technology itself makes many business processes easier.
    - Porter's five forces analysis / internet / rivalry ::@:: Pricing pressure increases because the internet widens the geographic market and increases the number of competitors.
- [strategic management](../../../../general/strategic%20management.md) ::@:: It involves the formulation and implementation of the major goals and initiatives taken by an organization's managers on behalf of stakeholders, based on consideration of resources and an assessment of the internal and external environments in which the organization operates.

    - strategic management / information system / competitiveness ::@:: It can help create competitive advantages over competitors. However, competitors can adapt similar systems. In the end, it is needed for survival, because if you do not use it, you lose to everyone else.
    - strategic management / information system / alignment ::@:: It can help analyze systems strategically. This is a business objective.
    - strategic management / information system / transition ::@:: Adopting it requires changing business processes, business objectives, and relations wit customers and suppliers. This is no easy task, so this transition needs to be managed well.
