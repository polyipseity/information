# questions

- HKUST ACCT 2200

Below are some questions or question tips.

## introduction to managerial accounting

- wholesalers vs. retailers ::@:: The former sells to other businesses. The latter sells to the general public. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,14,290!2025-07-07,15,290-->

## job order costing

- profitability by job ::@:: You can calculate the operating profit _separately_ for each job. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,14,290!2025-07-07,15,290-->
- rounding <!-- flashcard ID: 6450c70d-2bfe-47ce-bc52-39a179460870 -->::@:: In general, round to 2 decimal places. But when doing further calculations, keep more decimal places. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-08,16,290-->

## process costing

- rounding <!-- flashcard ID: 94474d74-075a-471e-8be3-09083d78a597 -->::@:: In general, round to 2 decimal places. But when doing further calculations, keep more decimal places. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-08,16,290-->
- weighted average method vs. first-in first-out \(FIFO\) method ::@:: In the former, costs and units last period and this period are grouped in the completion period. Cost per equivalent unit is the weighted average of the costs last period and this period. Since these two costs can differ significantly, calculation is inaccurate. Managers cannot evaluate costs by period independently. <p> In the latter, costs and units last period and this period are separated. Cost per equivalent unit is the average cost this period. Even if the average cost last period differs significantly, calculation is accurate. Managers can evaluate costs by period independently. <p> Managers care about which method is used because they provide different cost information. <!--SR:!2025-07-04,12,270!2025-07-07,15,290-->

## activity-based costing & cost management

- activity-based costing insights ::@:: For each activity pool, give suggestions \(ideally 3\) to reduce the activity or the activity rate \(price\) and briefly explain them. Even "obvious", "stupid", or "trivial" suggestions count! <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-08,16,290-->
- activity-based costing & pricing ::@:: For job orders, you can determine the job price more accurately. You are less likely to overcharge or undercharge customers, increasing customer satisfaction. Profitability of the company may be hurt or enhanced, depending on how the previous traditional costing assigns MOH. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-07,15,290-->
- just-in-time manufacturing advantages & disadvantages ::@:: Inventory costs are lower. Obsolete inventory are less likely. <p> More sensitive to supply chain issues, as there are little to no inventory for buffering. <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
- markup method vs. target cost method ::@:: The former starts from the cost and gives a price. It ignores market demand and supply. You are more prone to producing a product or service that is too expensive to have a market. <p> The latter starts from the market price and gives the target cost. It considers market supply and demand. <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
- rounding <!-- flashcard ID: 9e428c96-94f7-4906-9e68-1f3792ea20a5 -->::@:: In general, round to 2 decimal places. But when doing further calculations, keep more decimal places. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,14,290!2025-07-08,16,290-->
- traditional costing vs. activity-based costing ::@:: The former is less accurate. Only one cost driver is used. Some costs are overallocated or underallocated as some MOH is related to other unused cost drivers. <p> The latter is more accurate. Matching cost drivers are used, which should have some casual relations. <p> If product or service line overheads are available, we can also say if traditional costing overallocates or underallocates overhead for each product or service line. <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
- value added vs. non-value added ::@:: Consider activity effect on the product or service. If it affects the product or service such that its value increases, the activity is value added. Examples: machining, etc. <p> Otherwise, it is non-value added. Examples: inspection, transport, etc. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,14,290!2025-07-08,16,290-->

## cost behavior

- explanatory power ::@:: We use "R square" \(not "multiple R" or "adjusted R square"\) to say how much a model explains the output variable. Higher is considered better, but you also need to consider if it is easy to get the input variables. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,14,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
- high—low method: "high" and "low" ::@:: The "high"/"low" refers to the data point with the largest/smallest _x_ without regards to its _y_. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-08,16,290-->
- high—low method: suitability ::@:: Consider the vertical errors for data points in between. If the errors are high, it is not suitable. Otherwise, it is suitable. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->

## cost–volume–profit analysis

- comparing cost structures ::@:: We can write two profit equations for the two cost structures and equate them. The solved quantity is the indifference point. Above or below it, one of the cost structure is preferred \(determine which one using intuition\). <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-07,15,290-->
- decision making ::@:: CVP analysis produces target sales or units as outputs. <p> Consider if the target sales or units are realistic, e.g. capacity, customer attractiveness, etc. <p> For customer attractiveness, consider the factors \(ideally 3\) affecting it. Even "obvious", "stupid", or "trivial" factors count! Examples: competition, cultural barriers, market demand and supply, etc. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
- operating leverage ::@:: It is higher if the cost structure consists of more fixed costs. If operating leverage is high and there is a sale decrease, then it may not generate enough contribution margin to cover the fixed costs and incur loss. This increases financial risk because higher operating leverage means sale decrease results in a proportionally larger operating income decrease. <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
- rounding ::@:: In general, no need to round answers to integers unless explicitly told to do so. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,14,290!2025-07-07,15,290-->

## incremental analysis for short-term decision making

- opportunity cost due to full capacity ::@:: Use unit contribution margins to find the opportunity cost due to lost production. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,14,290!2025-07-07,15,290-->
- qualitative factors ::@:: customer relationships \(e.g. cutting current production angering existing customers\), employees \(e.g. firing, hiring\), market leader importance \(leading in offered products or services\), morale, price \(e.g. special orders are cheaper than normal orders leading to jealousy\), quality, sustainability goals, timeliness, wages \(e.g. working with outsiders with higher wages leading to jealousy\), etc. <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-08,16,290-->

## budgetary planning

- budgeting uncollectible sales ::@:: Consider uncollectible sales occurring in the subperiod after the last sales collection subperiod. Accounts receivable \(AR\) balance also reflects this. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,14,290!2025-07-07,15,290-->
- current loan balance ::@:: The instructor handles the current loan balance by adding an extra row showing the current loan balance after the ending cash balance. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,14,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
- depreciation :;@:: Remember to "less: depreciation" from cash disbursements, as they are not cash outflows, but likely included in fixed manufacturing overhead.
- preliminary cash balance ::@:: The instructor uses this cash balance to include everything \(including interest expense\) except for cash borrowed or \(repaid\). <!--SR:!2025-07-06,14,290!2025-07-07,15,290-->
- merging formats ::@:: Honestly you do not need to separate budgets exactly like outlined in the lecture slides, e.g. separating cash collection and receipt. Give what the question asks for with minimum effort. <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-08,16,290-->
- rounding ::@:: Some numbers, e.g. production units, may need rounding. Some numbers, e.g. direct materials inventory, do not. See what the question asks for, else use common sense. <p> Dollar amounts are rounded to 2 decimal places. For further calculations, no need to keep extra decimal places \(otherwise it would be painful\). <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-07,15,290-->

## variance analysis

- actual vs. standard ::@:: Actual is actual... pretty easy. Standard can be considered how many direct materials or direct labor hours should have been used given the _actual_ units produced. <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
- aliases ::@:: efficiency/quantity variance, price/rate variance <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-08,16,290-->
- order ::@:: arrow is subtraction direction: AQ \* AP ← \(change price\) ← AQ \* SP ← \(change quantity\) ← SQ \* SP <!--SR:!2025-06-30,5,250!2025-07-08,16,290-->

## decentralized performance evaluation

- balanced scorecard ::@:: Hard to say how to answer... Find more questions and solutions. And it is okay to write "obvious" and "useless" points. Writing more is \(almost\) always good, so blow water \(effectively\). <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
  - balanced scorecard / success ::@:: \(Re\)state the strategy. For each perspective in order, match the measures to the strategy, briefly explain how they correctly measure the strategy, and state if the strategy is successful. Usually, meeting the objectives for all 4 perspectives is needed to be considered successful. <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-08,16,290-->
  - balanced scorecard / finding causes ::@:: If the measures are useful for finding causes, \(re\)state the strategy, explain how they correctly measures the strategy, and infer the causes. <p> If the measures are not useful for finding causes, state many possible causes with reference to the strategy and then say the measures cannot help find the relevant causes among them. Then find one or two perspectives to add measures to, before the perspective of the "currently useless" measures, and state they can be _leading indicators_ for the "currently useless" measures. Then give two or three possible measures and briefly elaborate on them. <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
  - balanced scorecard / adding measures ::@:: Answer the question separately for each perspective. Also say the current focus of the scoreboard \(e.g. people, processes, products\) and the missing focuses. <p> Infer what is important for the company from its strategy. If the measures should be added, state this, and then state how this measures is relevant to the strategy, perhaps using a chain of reasoning along the 4 perspectives in order. Add details if you can think of it \(no need to care if the details carry marks\). <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
  - balanced scorecard / difficulties ::@:: For this one, you will really need to use common sense... <p> Remember to re\(state\) the strategy. Also offer suggestions to avoid this difficulty by using a slightly strategy. If you can think of it, also give a preferred approach/implementation to mitigate this \(e.g. assure employees there are no more layoffs, voluntary severance, etc.\). <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
- cost leadership vs. product differentiation ::@:: Useful in balanced scorecard questions. The strategies described are generally of one of these two types. <p> The former sells goods at a relatively low cost compared to other companies while maintaining acceptable quality. <p> The latter sells goods at a relatively high cost compared to other companies while having superior quality. <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-08,16,290-->
- multiple performance measures ::@:: Different performance measures may give different rankings. State the rankings for each performance measure _separately_. <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
- mutually beneficial transfer price ::@:: This means the price is halfway in between the floor \(_variable_ cost\) and the ceiling \(market price\). <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
- residual income vs. ROI ::@:: Residual income is generally what a company should maximize \(unless resource constrained\), because increasing it is equivalent to maximizing shareholder value \(which may not be the case for ROI\). Any project with residual income is viable. <p> Divisions of a company generally maximize whatever is used to measure its performance. For example, if ROI is used, then managers reject projects with lower ROI that the division's current ROI, regardless if it has positive residual income. Using residual income instead as performance measure can algin divisions' goals with the company's. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-07,15,290-->
- suitable transfer pricing ::@:: If there is no excess capacity, market price is the only suitable transfer price. Otherwise, anything in between the variable cost and the market price is suitable. The final price would depend on the relative bargaining power between the divisions. <!--SR:!2025-07-08,16,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->

## capital budgeting

- decision making ::@:: You can say a decision needs to be made carefully if the NPV is relatively small, the NPV is negative using an alternative discount rate, the accounting rate of return is relatively low, the payback period is long, etc. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->
- internal rate of return \(IRR\) approximation ::@:: There is no closed formula for IRR. But you can guess two IRRs and calculate the NPVs \(one negative, one positive\), and then give an IRR range such that it can answer the question. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-06,14,290-->

## examination 1

## examination 2

- "allocate an additional \$..." ::@:: This is an irrelevant cost. Be aware of the meaning of "allocate"! It means the company has already planned to spend that money, the difference is where the company spends it. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,15,290!2025-07-08,16,290-->
