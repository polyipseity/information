    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / rationale & handling ::@:: Such costs may be impossible or difficult to trace to particular jobs, consists of many different items, and may not be known until the end of a period. <p> So what we do is identify the cost driver (e.g. direct labor costs, direct labor hours, direct materials costs) and use it as an allocation base. Then use estimates to find the predetermined overhead rate (POHR). This rate is "predetermined" because it is determined before a period begins. <!--SR:!2025-06-16,84,288!2025-05-05,61,328-->
    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / underapplied & overapplied ::@:: The _applied_ manufacturing overhead found using POHR is only an _estimate_. At the end of a period, we can find the _actual_ manufacturing overhead. If applied MOH > actual MOH then it is overapplied, and vice versa. If applied MOH < actual MOH then it is underapplied. <p> This discrepancy is accounted for by adjusting the cost of goods sold (COGS), which will be discussed below. <!--SR:!2025-05-05,61,328!2025-05-05,61,328-->

- topic: process costing
- [process costing](../../../../general/process%20costing.md) ::@:: an accounting methodology that traces and accumulates direct costs, and allocates indirect costs of a manufacturing process <!--SR:!2025-04-29,52,342!2025-06-15,92,362-->
  - process costing / the other costing method ::@:: job costing <!--SR:!2025-06-14,91,362!2025-06-15,92,362-->
  - process costing / use ::@:: For _homogeneous_ products or services produced by standardized processes. <p> Product examples: bottled goods, canned goods, frozen food, paper products, petroleum products, etc. <br/> Service examples: claims and reimbursement process (insurance companies), home finance loans (financial institutions), etc. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,67,342!2025-06-12,89,362-->
  - process costing / overview ::@:: Raw material costs are first added to raw materials inventory. Then when they enter a process, the cost is transferred into the process's "direct materials" account. Conversion costs (direct labor + MOH) are directly added into the process's "conversion cost" account. <p> A unit may require multiple processes. When a unit is transferred from a process to another, we also need to transfer its corresponding cost, so we need to find out per unit cost in a process, which is what process costing does. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,67,342!2025-04-28,51,342-->
  - process costing / data ::@:: In a process, you need to track 4 things: direct materials (account), conversion cost (account), number of units in inventory (including new, WIP, and completed units), and percentage of completion (i.e. how much of units in the inventory are complete). <p> To do costing, first obtain the number for these 4 things at period start and period end. <!--SR:!2025-06-12,89,362!2025-04-29,52,342-->
    - process costing / data / direct materials ::@:: Basically just add the direct materials issued to the process during this period. <!--SR:!2025-06-13,90,362!2025-04-29,52,342-->
    - process costing / data / conversion cost ::@:: Basically just add the conversion cost (direct labor + _applied_ MOH) issued to the process during this period.  The _applied_ MOH can be found by multiplying POHR and the cost driver (usually direct labor hours) assigned to the process. <!--SR:!2025-05-05,20,302!2025-05-22,68,342-->
    - process costing / data / number of units in inventory ::@:: Count the units at period start and at period end. Also record how many unit started for production during this period. Then we can compute how many units have been transferred away (of course, the unit must be completed by the current process for it to be transferred away). <!--SR:!2025-05-22,68,342!2025-04-28,51,342-->
    - process costing / data / percentage of completion ::@:: It is likely given in the question. It only considers units that are in the inventory at period start and period end. <p> For weighted average cost, we do not need the number for period start. <!--SR:!2025-06-15,92,362!2025-06-15,92,362-->
  - process costing / steps ::@:: find physical units (transferred) โ convert physical units into equivalent units โ calculate cost per equivalent unit โ reconcile costs (using per unit cost) โ prepare production reports <!--SR:!2025-04-29,52,342!2025-06-10,87,362-->
  - process costing / methods ::@:: first-in, first-out (FIFO), weighted average cost, etc. <!--SR:!2025-06-15,92,362!2025-06-13,90,362-->
  - process costing / equivalent units ::@:: Remember in accounting, costs are only incurred when the performance happens. Since not all physical units in an inventory have been finished, equivalent units account for this by multiplying the completion percentage. <p> Note that it is calculated separately for direct materials (materials may not be all added at the process start) and conversion cost (WIP units). <!--SR:!2025-08-16,123,322!2025-06-15,92,362-->
    - process costing / equivalent units / different methods ::@:: weighted average cost method: The equivalent units include those in the starting inventory. <br/> first-in, first-out \(FIFO\) method: The equivalent units do _not_ include those in the starting inventory. <!--SR:!2025-08-20,128,401!2025-08-19,127,401-->
  - process costing / weighted average cost ::@:: Essentially, the per unit cost is calculated by dividing the _ending_ direct materials and _ending_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units. <!--SR:!2025-05-22,68,342!2025-04-29,52,342-->
    - process costing / weighted average cost / find physical units ::@:: Compute units transferred (which must be completed for them to be transferred in the first place). <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values. <!--SR:!2025-05-22,68,342!2025-04-29,52,342-->
      - process costing / weighted average cost / find physical units / table: [formats ยง process costing \(weighted average\)](formats.md#process%20costing%20(weighted%20average))
    - process costing / weighted average cost / convert physical units into equivalent units ::@:: Calculate equivalent units separately for direct materials and conversion cost. <p> Transferred (hence completed) physical units become equivalent units one-to-one (factor of 100%). Physical units in ending inventory are multiplied by the appropriate factors to become equivalent units. <p> For direct materials, multiply by the percentage of required materials added. (This is 100% if all materials have been added at the beginning.) For conversion cost, multiply by the completion percentage of the ending inventory. (This number is usually given.) <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values. <!--SR:!2025-07-13,97,302!2025-05-22,68,342-->

  - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) ::@:: Essentially, the per unit cost for _newly added_ materials and _newly added_ conversion is calculated by dividing the _added_ direct materials and _added_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units.

- topic: activity-based costing (ABC)
- [activity-based costing](../../../../general/activity-based%20costing.md) ::@:: It is a costing method that identifies activities in an organization and assigns the cost of each activity to all products and services according to the actual consumption by each. Therefore, this model assigns more indirect costs (overhead) into direct costs compared to conventional costing. <!--SR:!2025-06-14,88,368!2025-05-16,61,348-->
  - activity-based costing / the other costing method ::@:: volume-based costing (includes job costing, process costing) <!--SR:!2025-06-18,92,368!2025-06-18,92,368-->
- volume-based costing
  - volume-based costing / predetermined overhead rate (POHR) ::@:: POHR = estimated MOH / estimated cost driver. We need to identify the cost driver (e.g. direct labor costs, direct labor hours, direct materials costs) and use it as an allocation base. <!--SR:!2025-09-14,157,348!2025-05-23,66,348-->
  - volume-based costing / manufacturing overhead cost per unit ::@:: Find the cost driver assigned to the process producing the units. Then use POHR to find the (applied) manufacturing overhead.

- topic: activity-based costing (ABC)
- activity-based costing
  - activity-based costing / vs. volume-based costing ::@:: In volume-based costing, indirect costs are applied as applied MOH. POHR is used to find the applied MOH using a cost driver. <p> The problem is that MOH may be caused by multiple cost drivers. Using the same cost driver to estimate the actual MOH using applied MOH may be inaccurate. Activity-based costing assigns indirect costs to products and services based on the activities they require, making the applied MOH more accurate. This means using multiple cost drivers and having multiple POHR. <p> In this sense, activity-based costing _augments_ volume-based costing instead of _replacing_ it. <!--SR:!2025-05-18,66,348!2025-09-16,159,348-->
  - activity-based costing / two-staged allocation ::@:: Assign indirect costs to _activity cost pools_ (the costs over all pools _should_ sum up to the indirect costs). Then assign the pools to products or services. Note that an activity can be used by multiple products or services, and a product or service can use multiple pools. <!--SR:!2025-05-18,66,348!2025-06-12,86,368-->

    - activity-based costing / activity classification / batch-level ::@:: They support a batch (group of units/group of customers) at once, e.g. machine setup (one setup per batch), ordering materials, shipping a batch, etc. <!--SR:!2025-05-18,66,348!2025-05-18,66,348-->
    - activity-based costing / activity classification / unit-level ::@:: They support a unit or a customer individually, e.g. machining, part installation, product painting, serving a customer, etc. <!--SR:!2025-06-06,82,368!2025-05-18,66,348-->
  - activity-based costing / cost drivers ::@:: The cost drivers we have previously considered before ABC are _volume-based cost drivers_, e.g. direct materials, direct labor, machining hours, units produced, etc. In ABC, we also consider _non-volume-based cost drivers_, e.g. batch count, design count, processing time per unit, quality inspections, setup time, etc. <p> For each activity cost pool, we choose a cost driver that has a causal relationship with the activity, which should be non-volume-based cost drivers. <!--SR:!2025-07-27,109,328!2025-07-27,109,328-->
    - activity-based costing / cost drivers / advantages ::@:: By also considering non-volume-based cost drivers, it can assign indirect costs to products or services more accurately, especially those that require more indirect costs. <!--SR:!2025-06-13,87,368!2025-05-18,66,348-->

  - activity-based management / example ::@:: Instead of looking at processes/jobs to improve, we look at the activities that processes/jobs require across all processes/jobs. <p> Using ABC, then we can find high-cost activities, and improve on them. We can also identify _value-added_ costs (e.g. designing, machining) and _non-value-added_ costs (e.g. advertising, billing, inspection, meeting, transportation). <!--SR:!2025-06-22,90,379!2025-07-24,100,319-->
  - activity-based management / note ::@:: \(__this course__: After performing activity-based costing, how to answer the question "Comment on the results."? <p> Explain how ABC costing is better than traditional costing. Then compare/rank the projects/segments by gross margin \(_percentage_\) and net operating income \(_percentage_\), which shows the gross profit consumed by overhead from ABC costing. Make 3 or more suggestions on improving the project and segment with the lowest net operating income \(_percentage_\), with explanation.

    - activity-based management / note / ABC costing vs. traditional costing ::@:: Traditional costing uses only one cost driver. Thus, costs may be overallocated or underallocated as part of MOH is related to other unused cost drivers. ABC costing is more accurate because cost pools are used to match relevant cost drivers, which should have some causal relationship. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,5,370!2025-04-20,5,369-->

- [target costing](../../../../general/target%20costing.md) ::@:: It is an approach to determine a product's _life-cycle cost_ which should be sufficient to develop specified functionality and quality, while _ensuring_ its desired profit. <p> It differs from markup in that we use the market price (target price) and target profit to set the cost instead of the other way around. This way, market _supply and demand_ is considered. <!--SR:!2025-06-01,69,359!2025-06-03,71,359-->
  - target costing / equation ::@:: The target profit % (margin) is used to calculate the target profit from the target price.

- [variable costing](../../../../general/variable%20costing.md) ::@:: Under this method, manufacturing overhead is incurred in the period that a product is produced. This addresses the issue of absorption costing that allows income to rise as production rises. <p> Variable costing is generally not used for external reporting purposes.

- [total absorption costing](../../../../general/total%20absorption%20costing.md) ::@:: Under an absorption cost method, management can push forward costs to the next period when products are sold. This artificially inflates profits in the period of production by incurring less cost than would be incurred under a variable costing system. <p> Variable costing is generally not used for external reporting purposes. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, income statements must use absorption costing to comply with GAAP. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,91,386!2025-06-10,73,366-->

- variable costing
  - variable costing / from total absorption costing ::@:: Move all manufacturing (e.g. variable manufacturing costs) _and_ non-manufacturing (e.g. variable selling expenses) variable costs to variable costs. The variable costs should be based on units _sold_, not _manufactured_. <p> Move all manufacturing (e.g. manufacturing overhead) _and_ non-manufacturing (e.g. general and administrative expenses) fixed costs to fixed costs. _Importantly_, _all_ manufacturing overhead incurred (instead of the portion corresponding to sold goods) during the period is expensed. <!--SR:!2025-05-27,48,306!2025-04-24,35,326-->
  - variable costing / vs. total absorption costing ::@:: In the former, manufacturing overhead is expensed in the period the goods are produced. In the latter, manufacturing overhead is expensed in the period the goods are sold. <p> So the calculated net operating income differs. <!--SR:!2025-06-26,90,386!2025-05-13,50,346-->
    - variable costing / vs. total absorption costing / net operating income (NOP) ::@:: absorption NOP โ variable NOP = change in ending inventory ร manufacturing overhead per unit <p> Intuitively, changes in ending inventory reflect imbalance between production and sales. When production > sales, inventory increases and absorption NOP > variable NOP. When production < sales, inventory decreases and absorption NOP < variable NOP. <!--SR:!2025-06-04,68,366!2025-07-05,98,386-->

- costโvolumeโprofit analysis
  - costโvolumeโprofit analysis / product mix ::@:: CVP analysis can be applied to multiple products \(product mix\). However, different products may have different contribution margin ratio and unit contribution margin. <p> We can use _weighted average unit contribution margin_ or _weighted average contribution margin ratio_ method instead. They treat these products as if it is one product. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,5,370!2025-04-20,5,369-->
- contribution margin
  - contribution margin / weighted average unit ::@:: Calculate the weighted average by adding the unit contribution margins, weighted by unit mix. <p> When you want to find the _breakeven/target units_ for each product individually, you need to multiply the calculated breakeven/target units by the corresponding unit mix, since the units obtained above are as if each unit is a product mix. This applies for both _breakeven analysis_ and _target profit analysis_. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,5,370!2025-04-28,10,349-->
    - contribution margin / weighted average unit / characteristics ::@:: This assumes the unit mix remains the same regardless of the quantity, which is equivalent to the sales mix remaining the same \(but _numerically_, the mixes are not the same\). <!--SR:!2025-04-20,5,370!2025-04-20,5,370-->
  - contribution margin / weighted average ratio ::@:: Caluclate the weighted average by adding the contribution margin ratios, weighted by sales mix \(_not_ unit mix\). <p> When you want to find the _breakeven/target sales_ for each product individually, you need to multiply the calculated breakeven/target sales by the corresponding sales mix \(_not_ unit mix\). This applies for both _breakeven analysis_ and _target profit analysis_. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,5,370!2025-04-20,2,329-->
    - contribution margin / weighted average ratio / characteristics ::@:: This assumes the sales mix remains the same regardless of the quantity, which is equivalent to the unit mix remaining the same \(but _numerically_, the mixes are not the same\). <p> This approach is commonly used because aggregated information about revenue and costs by product line are usually available. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,5,369!2025-04-20,5,369-->

- opportunity cost
  - opportunity cost / capacity ::@:: At full capacity, existing products needs to be given up to make room for new products. We need to account for benefits and costs of existing products given up. <p> With idle capacity, this is not necessarily. <p> Also see _shadow price_. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,5,370!2025-04-20,5,370-->
- special order ::@:: It is an one-time order that is outside the scope of normal sales. <p> When performing costโbenefit analysis, we only account for the _incremental_ costs and benefits. That is, the change in costs and benefits between accepting and rejecting it. \(Considering the _incremental_ costs and benefits will automatically consider the opportunity costs.\) <!--SR:!2025-04-20,5,370!2025-04-20,5,369-->

    - outsourcing / decision / incremental costs and benefits ::@:: Most if not all direct costs are avoidable. They should be included. <p> Most if not all \(indirect\) fixed overhead costs are unavoidable. They should be excluded. <p> Some costs/benefits can be considered as either an opportunity cost of an option or a benefit of the other option, but not both, otherwise you double count. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,5,370!2025-04-20,5,370-->
    - outsourcing / decision / qualitative factors ::@:: Incremental analysis usually only focuses on the _economic_ aspect of the _triple bottom line_. What about _environmental_ or _social_ ones? <p> For example, outsourcing a food service, they include operation cruicalness, human resources, liability, quality, safety, etc. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,5,370!2025-04-20,5,370-->

  - contribution margin / constrained optimzation ::@:: When a capacity or resource restrict a company from satisfying demand \(implies not demand constrained\), that capacity or resource is a _bottleneck_. <p> Assuming we have only 1 bottleneck. _Contribution margin per capacity or resource_ can be used to allocate said bottleneck to different products or services to maximize contribution margin. Fixed costs are ignored because it will not change _in the short run_. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,5,370!2025-04-20,5,370-->
    - contribution margin / constrained optimization / method ::@:: Assuming there is only 1 bottleneck and there is sufficient demand \(i.e. not demand constrained\). <p> Identify the demands and _bottleneck_. Divide the contribution margin of each product or service by the bottleneck capacity or resource required. This gives _contribution margin per bottleneck capacity or resource_. Finally, allocate resources to products with the highest contribution margins per bottleneck capacity or resource, until either its demand is fully satisfied or the resource has run out. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,5,369!2025-04-20,5,369-->

- topic: budgetary planning
- [budget](../../../../general/budget.md) ::@:: It is a calculation plan, usually but not always financial, for a defined period, often one year or a month. A budget may include anticipated sales volumes and revenues, resource quantities including time, costs and expenses, environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions, other impacts, assets, liabilities and cash flows.
