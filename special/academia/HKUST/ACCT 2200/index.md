- [management accounting](../../../../general/management%20accounting.md)
  - management accounting / purpose ::@:: decision-making orientation: provide useful information to internal managers for making decisions
  - management accounting / vs. financial accounting ::@:: audience, detail level, information nature, report frequency, report types
    - management accounting / vs. financial accounting / audience ::@:: internal parties, e.g. managers, employees (sometimes); external parties, e.g. creditors, investors, regulators
    - management accounting / vs. financial accounting / detail level ::@:: decision-making level; whole-company level
    - management accounting / vs. financial accounting / information nature ::@:: future oriented, relevant, subjective; historical, objective, reliable
    - management accounting / vs. financial accounting / report frequency ::@:: prepared as needed, can be daily or even real-time; prepared periodically, e.g. monthly, quarterly, yearly
    - management accounting / vs. financial accounting / report types ::@:: various internal reports, e.g. budget, cost reports, performance evaluations; financial statements according to GAAP/IFRS
  - management accounting / functions ::@:: plan, implement, control, (cycle); based on decision-making
  - management accounting / role of cost ::@:: inventory valuation; profitability determination; provides management information
- types of organizations ::@:: manufacturing company, merchandising company, service company
  - manufacturing company ::@:: purchase raw material from suppliers, manufacture finished products, sell finished products
  - merchandising company ::@:: sell manufactured goods; wholesalers: to other businesses; retailers: to the general public
  - service company ::@:: provide service to clients or customers
- types of costs ::@:: directness, manufacturing, relevance, timing, variability
  - types of costs / directness ::@:: direct vs. indirect
  - types of costs / manufacturing ::@:: manufacturing vs. non-manufacturing
  - types of costs / relevance ::@:: relevance vs. irrelevance
  - types of costs / timing ::@:: product vs. period
  - types of costs / variability ::@:: variable vs. fixed
- [direct costs](../../../../general/direct%20costs.md) ::@:: convenient and easily traceable to a cost object, e.g. cost of labors and materials to produce a product
- [indirect costs](../../../../general/indirect%20costs.md) ::@:: inconvenient or hardly traceable to a cost object, e.g. advertising, depreciation, supervision, utilities
- [variable cost](../../../../general/variable%20cost.md) ::@:: costs that change according to the activity level; usually we assume the variable cost is proportional to the activity level (constant marginal cost)
- [fixed cost](../../../../general/fixed%20cost.md) ::@:: costs that do not change regardless of the activity level (within a reasonable range); average cost or per-unit cost varies inversely with the activity level
- [manufacturing cost](../../../../general/manufacturing%20cost.md) ::@:: all costs to produce the physical product; the sum of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead
  - [direct materials cost](../../../../general/direct%20materials%20cost.md) ::@:: major material input that are conveniently and easily traceable to the final product, e.g. food ingredients in a pizza, glass windows in a car
  - [direct labor cost](../../../../general/direct%20labor%20cost.md) ::@:: labor cost that are conveniently and easily traceable to the final product,e.g. wages to assembly line workers, wages to cooks, but _not_ wages to managers
  - [manufacturing overhead](../../../../general/overhead%20(business).md) (MOH) ::@:: all costs needed to manufacture a product that are neither direct materials nor direct labor (i.e. indirect costs), e.g. depreciation, maintenance, insurance, property taxes, repairs, utilities, wages to supervisors
  - prime cost ::@:: direct materials + direct labor
  - conversion cost ::@:: direct labor + manufacturing overhead
  - non-manufacturing cost ::@:: includes all other costs that are not manufacturing costs, e.g. general & administration (G&A), marketing, selling
- product cost ::@:: cost that is incurred per product, e.g. manufacturing costs; goes to "cost of goods sold", and generates future benefits
- period cost ::@:: cost that is incurred periodically, e.g. non-manufacturing costs; goes to "period expenses", and does not generate future benefits (directly)
- [relevant cost](../../../../genera/relevant%20cost.md) ::@:: a cost that has potential to influence decision making, which differs between decision alternatives (differential/incremental costs) and must be incurred in the future (non-sunk costs)
  - irrelevant cost ::@:: costs that are not relevant, e.g. sunk costs
- out-of-pocket costs (explicit cost in economics) ::@:: costs that involve actual outgoing cash
- [opportunity cost](../../../../general/opportunity%20cost.md) (same as that in economics) ::@:: forgone benefit of the best decision that is _not_ taken
