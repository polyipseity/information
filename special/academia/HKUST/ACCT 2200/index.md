    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / rationale & handling ::@:: Such costs may be impossible or difficult to trace to particular jobs, consists of many different items, and may not be known until the end of a period. <p> So what we do is identify the cost driver (e.g. direct labor costs, direct labor hours, direct materials costs) and use it as an allocation base. Then use estimates to find the predetermined overhead rate (POHR). This rate is "predetermined" because it is determined before a period begins. <!--SR:!2026-05-26,336,308!2026-02-14,282,348-->
    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / underapplied & overapplied ::@:: The _applied_ manufacturing overhead found using POHR is only an _estimate_. At the end of a period, we can find the _actual_ manufacturing overhead. If applied MOH > actual MOH then it is overapplied, and vice versa. If applied MOH < actual MOH then it is underapplied. <p> This discrepancy is accounted for by adjusting the cost of goods sold (COGS), which will be discussed below. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,281,348!2026-02-12,280,348-->

- topic: process costing
- [process costing](../../../../general/process%20costing.md) ::@:: an accounting methodology that traces and accumulates direct costs, and allocates indirect costs of a manufacturing process <!--SR:!2026-01-07,249,362!2026-09-27,458,382-->
  - process costing / the other costing method ::@:: job costing <!--SR:!2026-09-23,455,382!2026-10-02,464,382-->
  - process costing / use ::@:: For _homogeneous_ products or services produced by standardized processes. <p> Product examples: bottled goods, canned goods, frozen food, paper products, petroleum products, etc. <br/> Service examples: claims and reimbursement process (insurance companies), home finance loans (financial institutions), etc. <!--SR:!2026-04-01,310,362!2026-09-10,442,382-->
  - process costing / overview ::@:: Raw material costs are first added to raw materials inventory. Then when they enter a process, the cost is transferred into the process's "direct materials" account. Conversion costs (direct labor + MOH) are directly added into the process's "conversion cost" account. <p> A unit may require multiple processes. When a unit is transferred from a process to another, we also need to transfer its corresponding cost, so we need to find out per unit cost in a process, which is what process costing does. <!--SR:!2026-04-02,311,362!2025-12-29,240,362-->
  - process costing / data ::@:: In a process, you need to track 4 things: direct materials (account), conversion cost (account), number of units in inventory (including new, WIP, and completed units), and percentage of completion (i.e. how much of units in the inventory are complete). <p> To do costing, first obtain the number for these 4 things at period start and period end. <!--SR:!2026-09-11,443,382!2027-06-30,610,342-->
    - process costing / data / direct materials ::@:: Basically just add the direct materials issued to the process during this period. <!--SR:!2026-09-22,454,382!2026-01-01,243,362-->
    - process costing / data / conversion cost ::@:: Basically just add the conversion cost (direct labor + _applied_ MOH) issued to the process during this period.  The _applied_ MOH can be found by multiplying POHR and the cost driver (usually direct labor hours) assigned to the process. <!--SR:!2026-08-10,373,342!2026-04-11,320,362-->
    - process costing / data / number of units in inventory ::@:: Count the units at period start and at period end. Also record how many unit started for production during this period. Then we can compute how many units have been transferred away (of course, the unit must be completed by the current process for it to be transferred away). <!--SR:!2026-04-10,319,362!2025-12-28,239,362-->
    - process costing / data / percentage of completion ::@:: It is likely given in the question. It only considers units that are in the inventory at period start and period end. <p> For weighted average cost, we do not need the number for period start. <!--SR:!2026-09-25,456,382!2026-09-28,461,382-->
  - process costing / steps ::@:: find physical units (transferred) → convert physical units into equivalent units → calculate cost per equivalent unit → reconcile costs (using per unit cost) → prepare production reports <!--SR:!2027-06-27,606,342!2026-09-01,432,382-->
  - process costing / methods ::@:: first-in, first-out (FIFO), weighted average cost, etc. <!--SR:!2026-09-24,455,382!2026-09-21,453,382-->
  - process costing / equivalent units ::@:: Remember in accounting, costs are only incurred when the performance happens. Since not all physical units in an inventory have been finished, equivalent units account for this by multiplying the completion percentage. <p> Note that it is calculated separately for direct materials (materials may not be all added at the process start) and conversion cost (WIP units). <!--SR:!2027-02-17,548,342!2026-10-03,464,382-->
    - process costing / equivalent units / different methods ::@:: weighted average cost method: The equivalent units include those in the starting inventory. <br/> first-in, first-out \(FIFO\) method: The equivalent units do _not_ include those in the starting inventory. <!--SR:!2027-01-21,519,401!2027-07-15,695,421-->
  - process costing / weighted average cost ::@:: Essentially, the per unit cost is calculated by dividing the _ending_ direct materials and _ending_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units. <!--SR:!2026-04-14,323,362!2026-01-02,244,362-->
    - process costing / weighted average cost / find physical units ::@:: Compute units transferred (which must be completed for them to be transferred in the first place). <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values. <!--SR:!2026-04-13,322,362!2026-01-06,248,362-->
      - process costing / weighted average cost / find physical units / table: [formats § process costing \(weighted average\)](formats.md#process%20costing%20(weighted%20average))
    - process costing / weighted average cost / convert physical units into equivalent units ::@:: Calculate equivalent units separately for direct materials and conversion cost. <p> Transferred (hence completed) physical units become equivalent units one-to-one (factor of 100%). Physical units in ending inventory are multiplied by the appropriate factors to become equivalent units. <p> For direct materials, multiply by the percentage of required materials added.

  - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) ::@:: Essentially, the per unit cost for _newly added_ materials and _newly added_ conversion is calculated by dividing the _added_ direct materials and _added_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units.

- topic: activity-based costing (ABC)
- [activity-based costing](../../../../general/activity-based%20costing.md) ::@:: It is a costing method that identifies activities in an organization and assigns the cost of each activity to all products and services according to the actual consumption by each. Therefore, this model assigns more indirect costs (overhead) into direct costs compared to conventional costing. <!--SR:!2026-09-18,451,388!2026-03-08,295,368-->
  - activity-based costing / the other costing method ::@:: volume-based costing (includes job costing, process costing) <!--SR:!2026-10-06,469,388!2026-10-09,471,388-->
- volume-based costing
  - volume-based costing / predetermined overhead rate (POHR) ::@:: POHR = estimated MOH / estimated cost driver. We need to identify the cost driver (e.g. direct labor costs, direct labor hours, direct materials costs) and use it as an allocation base. <!--SR:!2027-10-06,752,368!2026-04-08,317,368-->
  - volume-based costing / manufacturing overhead cost per unit ::@:: Find the cost driver assigned to the process producing the units. Then use POHR to find the (applied) manufacturing overhead.

- topic: activity-based costing (ABC)
- activity-based costing
  - activity-based costing / vs. volume-based costing ::@:: In volume-based costing, indirect costs are applied as applied MOH. POHR is used to find the applied MOH using a cost driver. <p> The problem is that MOH may be caused by multiple cost drivers. Using the same cost driver to estimate the actual MOH using applied MOH may be inaccurate. Activity-based costing assigns indirect costs to products and services based on the activities they require, making the applied MOH more accurate. This means using multiple cost drivers and having multiple POHR. <p> In this sense, activity-based costing _augments_ volume-based costing instead of _replacing_ it. <!--SR:!2026-04-06,315,368!2027-03-16,546,348-->
  - activity-based costing / two-staged allocation ::@:: Assign indirect costs to _activity cost pools_ (the costs over all pools _should_ sum up to the indirect costs). Then assign the pools to products or services. Note that an activity can be used by multiple products or services, and a product or service can use multiple pools. <!--SR:!2026-04-04,313,368!2026-09-03,434,388-->

  - activity-based costing / cost drivers ::@:: The cost drivers we have previously considered before ABC are _volume-based cost drivers_, e.g. direct materials, direct labor, machining hours, units produced, etc. In ABC, we also consider _non-volume-based cost drivers_, e.g. batch count, design count, processing time per unit, quality inspections, setup time, etc. <p> For each activity cost pool, we choose a cost driver that has a causal relationship with the activity, which should be non-volume-based cost drivers. <!--SR:!2026-12-14,499,348!2026-12-13,498,348-->
    - activity-based costing / cost drivers / advantages ::@:: By also considering non-volume-based cost drivers, it can assign indirect costs to products or services more accurately, especially those that require more indirect costs. <!--SR:!2026-09-14,445,388!2026-04-07,316,368-->

  - activity-based management / example ::@:: Instead of looking at processes/jobs to improve, we look at the activities that processes/jobs require across all processes/jobs. <p> Using ABC, then we can find high-cost activities, and improve on them. We can also identify _value-added_ costs (e.g. designing, machining) and _non-value-added_ costs (e.g. advertising, billing, inspection, meeting, transportation). <!--SR:!2026-10-11,472,399!2026-10-16,448,339-->
  - activity-based management / note ::@:: \(__this course__: After performing activity-based costing, how to answer the question "Comment on the results."? <p> Explain how ABC costing is better than traditional costing. Mention _cost substitution effect_ that overstates the cost of a project and understates another. Since the price is based on \(something\), it is likely a project is _overpriced_ and the other is _underpriced_. For the _overpriced_ project \(traditional costing ranks higher but ABC costing ranks lower\), for each activity, state how its cost driver compares to the other project, and give 2 to 3 suggestions to reduce it. <p> Remember 1 mark 1 point. Don't be afraid to write "obvious" or "stupid" points.\) <!--SR:!2027-02-20,519,410!2027-12-06,784,430-->
    - activity-based management / note / ABC costing vs. traditional costing ::@:: Traditional costing uses only one cost driver. Thus, costs may be over-allocated or under-allocated as part of MOH is related to other unused cost drivers. ABC costing is more accurate because cost pools are used to match relevant cost drivers, which should have some causal relationship. <!--SR:!2027-08-20,700,430!2027-09-25,731,429-->

- [target costing](../../../../general/target%20costing.md) ::@:: It is an approach to determine a product's _life-cycle cost_ which should be sufficient to develop specified functionality and quality, while _ensuring_ its desired profit. <p> It differs from markup in that we use the market price (target price) and target profit to set the cost instead of the other way around. This way, market _supply and demand_ is considered. <!--SR:!2026-05-14,347,379!2026-05-20,350,379-->
  - target costing / equation ::@:: The target profit % (margin) is used to calculate the target profit from the target price. Then use the following equation: <p> target price – target profit = target cost <p> And then the target cost is the maximum amount spendable for lifecycle cost while ensuring a XX% profit/return. <!--SR:!2026-10-15,477,399!2026-11-13,502,399-->

  - total absorption costing / manufacturing overhead ::@:: divided between cost of goods sold (when overapplied, underapplied, or sold) and ending inventory (when unsold) <!--SR:!2026-12-24,529,406!2026-11-04,493,406-->
  - total absorption / formula ::@:: (net) sales, less: cost of goods sold, (subtotal:) _gross margin_, less: non-manufacturing expenses, (total:) net operating income <!--SR:!2027-03-29,544,346!2027-01-01,537,406-->
- variable costing
  - variable costing / from total absorption costing ::@:: Move all manufacturing (e.g. variable manufacturing costs) _and_ non-manufacturing (e.g. variable selling expenses) variable costs to variable costs. The variable costs should be based on units _sold_, not _manufactured_. <p> Move all manufacturing (e.g. manufacturing overhead) _and_ non-manufacturing (e.g. general and administrative expenses) fixed costs to fixed costs. _Importantly_, _all_ manufacturing overhead incurred (instead of the portion corresponding to sold goods) during the period is expensed. <!--SR:!2025-12-17,199,326!2027-10-13,746,366-->
  - variable costing / vs. total absorption costing ::@:: In the former, manufacturing overhead is expensed in the period the goods are produced. In the latter, manufacturing overhead is expensed in the period the goods are sold. <p> So the calculated net operating income differs. <!--SR:!2026-10-20,481,406!2026-01-09,237,366-->
    - variable costing / vs. total absorption costing / net operating income (NOP) ::@:: absorption NOP – variable NOP = change in ending inventory × manufacturing overhead per unit <p> Intuitively, changes in ending inventory reflect imbalance between production and sales. When production > sales, inventory increases and absorption NOP > variable NOP. When production < sales, inventory decreases and absorption NOP < variable NOP. <!--SR:!2026-05-18,348,386!2026-07-21,381,386-->

- topic: cost–volume–profit \(CVP\) analysis, incremental analysis for short-term decision making
- cost–volume–profit analysis
  - cost–volume–profit analysis / product mix ::@:: CVP analysis can be applied to multiple products \(product mix\). However, different products may have different contribution margin ratio and unit contribution margin. <p> We can use _weighted average unit contribution margin_ or _weighted average contribution margin ratio_ method instead. They treat these products as if it is one product. <!--SR:!2027-08-29,708,430!2027-10-02,737,429-->
- contribution margin
  - contribution margin / weighted average unit ::@:: Calculate the weighted average _unit_ by adding the unit contribution margins, weighted by unit mix. <p> When you want to find the _breakeven/target units_ for each product individually, you need to multiply the calculated breakeven/target units by the corresponding unit mix, since the units obtained above are as if each unit is a product mix. This applies for both _breakeven analysis_ and _target profit analysis_. <!--SR:!2027-11-22,772,430!2025-12-11,170,369-->
    - contribution margin / weighted average unit / characteristics ::@:: This assumes the unit mix remains the same regardless of the quantity, which is equivalent to the sales mix remaining the same \(but _numerically_, the mixes are not the same\). <!--SR:!2027-02-22,520,410!2027-03-16,537,410-->
  - contribution margin / weighted average ratio ::@:: Calculate the weighted average _ratio_ by adding the contribution margin ratios, weighted by sales mix \(_not_ unit mix\). <p> When you want to find the _breakeven/target sales_ for each product individually, you need to multiply the calculated breakeven/target sales by the corresponding sales mix \(_not_ unit mix\). This applies for both _breakeven analysis_ and _target profit analysis_. <!--SR:!2027-12-01,780,430!2027-08-10,668,389-->
    - contribution margin / weighted average ratio / characteristics ::@:: This assumes the sales mix remains the same regardless of the quantity, which is equivalent to the unit mix remaining the same \(but _numerically_, the mixes are not the same\). <p> This approach is commonly used because aggregated information about revenue and costs by product line are usually available. <!--SR:!2027-09-23,729,429!2027-03-23,542,409-->

  - irrelevant cost
- opportunity cost
  - opportunity cost / capacity ::@:: At full capacity, existing products needs to be given up to make room for new products. We need to account for benefits and costs of existing products given up. <p> With idle capacity, this is not necessary. <p> Also see _shadow price_. <!--SR:!2027-09-27,733,430!2027-09-06,715,430-->
- special order ::@:: It is an one-time order that is outside the scope of normal sales. <p> When performing cost—benefit analysis, we only account for the _incremental_ costs and benefits. That is, the change in costs and benefits between accepting and rejecting it. \(Considering the _incremental_ costs and benefits will automatically consider the opportunity costs.\) <!--SR:!2027-09-01,710,430!2027-08-30,708,429-->
  - special order / relevant costs ::@:: For products, they include contribution margin lost on regular sales \(due to full capacity\), direct labor, direct materials, _variable_ manufacturing overhead, etc. <!--SR:!2026-04-05,282,389!2027-12-22,798,430-->
  - special order / irrelevant costs ::@:: For products, they include _fixed_ manufacturing overhead, etc. <!--SR:!2027-11-16,767,430!2027-09-29,734,429-->
  - special order / analysis: [formats § incremental analysis \(unit\)](formats.md#incremental%20analysis%20(unit))
  - special order / qualitative factors ::@:: Incremental analysis usually only focuses on the _economic_ aspect of the _triple bottom line_. What about _environmental_ or _social_ ones? <p> For example, price \(e.g. providing cheaper special orders, casuing regular order customers to pressure to lower prices\), timeliness, wages \(e.g. paying better wages to outside contractors than own employees, causing employees to ask for a raise\), etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,144,425!2027-04-04,565,424-->
- [outsourcing](../../../../general/outsourcing.md) ::@:: It is is a business practice in which companies use external providers to carry out business processes, that would otherwise be handled internally. <!--SR:!2027-08-26,705,430!2027-12-14,791,430-->
  - outsourcing / decision ::@:: insoucing vs. outsourcing, make-or-buy <!--SR:!2027-10-05,739,430!2027-09-07,715,430-->
    - outsourcing / decision / factors ::@:: incremental costs and benefits, opportunity costs, _qualitative_ factors \(usually not accounted for when calculating incremental costs and benefits\) <!--SR:!2027-08-23,703,430!2027-09-26,732,429-->
    - outsourcing / decision / incremental costs and benefits ::@:: Most if not all direct costs are avoidable. They should be included. <p> Most if not all \(indirect\) fixed overhead costs are unavoidable. They should be excluded. <p> Some costs/benefits can be considered as either an opportunity cost of an option or a benefit of the other option, but not both, otherwise you double count. <!--SR:!2027-09-15,722,430!2027-09-12,719,430-->
    - outsourcing / decision / qualitative factors ::@:: Incremental analysis usually only focuses on the _economic_ aspect of the _triple bottom line_. What about _environmental_ or _social_ ones? <p> For example, outsourcing a food service, they include operation cruicalness, human resources, liability, quality, safety, etc. <!--SR:!2027-12-24,800,430!2027-08-28,706,430-->

- contribution margin
  - contribution margin / constrained optimzation ::@:: When a capacity or resource restrict a company from satisfying demand \(implies not demand constrained\), that capacity or resource is a _bottleneck_. <p> Assuming we have only 1 bottleneck. _Contribution margin per capacity or resource_ can be used to allocate said bottleneck to different products or services to maximize contribution margin. Fixed costs are ignored because it will not change _in the short run_. <!--SR:!2026-08-04,367,390!2027-09-10,718,430-->
    - contribution margin / constrained optimization / method ::@:: Assuming there is only 1 bottleneck and there is sufficient demand \(i.e. not demand constrained\). <p> Identify the demands and _bottleneck_. Divide the contribution margin of each product or service by the bottleneck capacity or resource required. This gives _contribution margin per bottleneck capacity or resource_. Finally, allocate resources to products with the highest contribution margins per bottleneck capacity or resource, until either its demand is fully satisfied or the resource has run out. <!--SR:!2027-11-20,770,429!2027-04-26,563,409-->

- budget
  - budget / depreciation ::@:: It allocates cost to fixed assets as an expense. However, from a cash flow standpoint, all costs have been incurred at the start, and depreciation are not cash flows. <p> This explains why capital expenditure \(capex\) needs to be added to budgeted cash payments, while depreciation needs to be subtracted from budgeted cash payments. <!--SR:!2025-11-13,140,425!2025-11-19,149,425-->

  - standard cost accounting / standard cost card: [formats § standard cost card](formats.md#standard%20cost%20card)
- flexible budget ::@:: The _master budget_ is based on the best estimate of sales volume, multiplied by the _standard manufacturing cost per unit_. <p> _Flexible budgets_ show how budgeted costs change if the actual sales differ from the best estimate, but still multiplied by the standard manufacturing cost per unit. <!--SR:!2025-11-19,148,425!2027-05-23,597,425-->
- [variance](../../../../general/variance%20(accounting).md) ::@:: It is the difference between a budgeted, planned, or standard cost and the actual amount incurred/sold. Variances can be computed for both costs and revenues. <!--SR:!2025-11-11,138,425!2025-11-19,146,425-->
- variance analysis ::@:: It is a tool of budgetary control and performance evaluation, assessing any variances between the budgeted, planned, or standard amount, and the actual amount realized. Variance analysis can be carried out for both costs and revenues. <!--SR:!2028-01-18,805,441!2025-11-20,147,421-->
  - variance analysis / types ::@:: Variance can be classified into _spending variance_ and _volume variances_. The former accounts for differences between the _actual budget_ and the _flexible budget_ with the same sale units. The latter accounts for differences between the _flexible budget_ and the _master budget_. <!--SR:!2025-11-24,151,425!2025-11-17,144,425-->
    - variable analysis / types / variable ::@:: For variable costs, e.g. direct materials \(DM\), direct labor \(DL\), and variable manufacturing overhead \(VOH\), _spending variance_ can be further separated into _price variance_ and _efficiency variance_ \(_quantity variance_ for DM\). <p> _Volume variance_ is ignored, as it is already accounted for by the _flexible budget_. <!--SR:!2025-11-10,137,425!2025-11-18,146,425-->
    - variable analysis / types / fixed ::@:: For fixed costs, e.g. fixed manufacturing overhead \(FOH\), both _spending variance_ and _volume variance_ needs to be considered. <p> Note that _volume variance_ compares the FOH in _master budget_ \(the _fixed FOH rate per unit_ is also from master budget\) and the _applied FOH_ based on actual volume \(fixed FOH rate per unit multiplied by _actual units_\) instead of that in the _flexible budget_ \(actually, it should be the same as that in master budget because fixed MOH should not change with volume\). <!--SR:!2026-06-17,300,385!2025-11-15,143,425-->
  - variance analysis / favorability ::@:: Variance calculation should always be calculated by taking the planned or budgeted amount and subtracting the actual/forecasted value. Thus a positive number is favorable and a negative number is unfavorable. <!--SR:!2025-11-12,139,421!2027-05-22,561,421-->
    - variance analysis / favorability / causes ::@:: It should be obvious what is _favorable_, e.g. paying lower prices/wages, producing more using less resources, using less materials, using less time, etc. The opposite is _unfavorable_. <!--SR:!2027-12-14,768,441!2025-11-16,144,425-->

  - variance analysis / spending variance ::@:: It is the sum of price variance and quantity variance. It is also the difference between the actual budget and the flexible budget. <p> It is computed as: $$\text{spending variance} = \text{price variance} + \text{quantity variance} = \text{SQ} \cdot \text{SP} - \text{AQ} \cdot \text{AP} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-12-03,421,401!2025-11-09,136,425-->

- [accounting rate of return](../../../../general/accounting%20rate%20of%20return.md) \(ARR\) ::@:: It is a financial ratio used in capital budgeting. The ratio does not take into account the concept of time value of money. ARR calculates the return, generated from net income of the proposed capital investment. The ARR is a percentage return. Say, if ARR = 7%, then it means that the project is expected to earn seven cents out of each dollar invested \(yearly\). <!--SR:!2025-11-11,140,421!2028-02-05,822,445-->

  - accounting rate of return / disadvantages ::@:: The main disadvantage of ARR is that it disregards the time factor in terms of time value of money or risks for long term investments. The ARR is built on evaluation of profits, and it can be easily manipulated with changes in depreciation methods. The ARR can give misleading information when evaluating investments of different size. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,145,421!2025-11-25,152,425-->

  - payback period / calculation ::@:: Calculate the time required to payback the initial investment. No discounting is done. <p> On an annual basis, subtract annual net cash flows from the initial investment until it is non-positive. Each subtraction adds one year to the payback period except for the last year. For the last year, assume the net cash flows is received evenly continuously, so simply divide the remaining unpaid investment by the annual net cash flow, and add this to the payback period. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,142,424!2025-11-14,143,425-->

- topic: capital budgeting
- [time value of money](../../../../general/time%20value%20of%20money.md) ::@:: It refers to the fact that there is normally a greater benefit to receiving a sum of money now rather than an identical sum later. It may be seen as an implication of the later-developed concept of time preference. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,137,425!2025-11-10,138,425-->
  - time value of money / timeline ::@:: This tool can visualize cash inflows and outflows easily. It is a number line staring from time 0 on the left. Label cash inflows \(positive; e.g. return\), cash outflows \(negative; e.g. investments\), and their amounts under the number line. <!--SR:!2025-11-23,152,425!2025-11-20,147,424-->
  - time value of money / future value ::@:: Move the cash flow forward in time: $FV = PV \cdot (1 + r)^t$, where $t$ is the number of time periods forward \(beware of off-by-one error\). <!--SR:!2025-11-13,142,425!2027-05-30,596,425-->
    - time value of money / future value / compounding ::@:: Future value uses compound interest instead of simple interest. In the former, interest is earned on principal only. In the latter, interest is earned on principal and interest received. <p> Given a long enough time, compound interest gives much money money than simple interest. On a graph, compound interest increases exponentially while simple interest increases linearly. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,138,425!2025-11-17,144,425-->
  - time value of money / present value ::@:: Move the cash flow backward in time: $PV = \frac {FV} {(1 + r)^t}$, where $t$ is the number of time periods backwards \(beware of off-by-one error\). <!--SR:!2025-11-10,137,425!2025-11-23,150,425-->
  - time value of money / combining cash flow ::@:: Only cash flows at the same time can be added together. Cash flows at different time must be converted to cash flows at the same time by either compounding or discounting cash flows. <!--SR:!2025-11-22,150,425!2025-11-19,146,421-->
- [discounted cash flow](../../../../general/discounted%20cash%20flow.md) ::@:: It is a method used to value a security, project, company, or asset, that incorporates the time value of money. <!--SR:!2025-11-25,152,425!2027-12-22,775,441-->
  - discounted cash flow / methods ::@:: net present value \(NPV\), internal rate of return \(IRR\), profitability index \(PI\) <!--SR:!2025-11-12,139,425!2025-11-23,150,425-->
  - discounted cash flow / assumptions ::@:: Various assumptions are used to simplify calculations when using discounted cash flow. \(__this course__: We make 3 important _assumptions_: future cash flows happen at year end, future cash flows are immediately reinvested, and future cash flows are certain.\) <!--SR:!2027-03-18,551,425!2025-11-21,150,425-->
- [net present value](../../../../general/net%20present%20value.md) (NPV) ::@:: net present value (NPV) = present value (benefits/cash inflows) − present value (costs/cash outflows) <!--SR:!2025-11-18,147,424!2025-11-13,142,425-->
  - net present value / interpretation ::@:: Zero NPV (cf. _normal profit_ in economics) allows us to recover invested capital (i.e. no loss) and receive return on capital (i.e. return comparable with the market interest rate). Positive NPV (cf. _abnormal profit_ in economics) _additionally_ allows us to create _value_ for investors (i.e. extra return above the market interest rate). <!--SR:!2025-11-08,135,425!2025-11-10,139,421-->
    - net present value / interpretation / zero NPV ::@:: From an economics standpoint, in a _perfectly_ competitive/efficient market, there should not be any abnormal profit, i.e. no investments with positive NPV. Investments are either zero or negative NPV. So you _should accept_ zero NPV projects unless you have good \(non-financial\) reasons to not to. <p> \(Of course, the real world is not _perfectly_ competitive/efficient...\) <!--SR:!2025-11-11,139,425!2027-12-16,769,441-->
- [present value](../../../../general/present%20value.md) ::@:: Money obtained in the future has less value in the present due to interest rate. <p> Present value and future value are related by: $$\text{FV} = (1 + r)^t \text{PV} \,,$$ where $r$ is the interest rate in a time period, and $t$ is the number (can be fractional) of time periods. Or just look up in a table... \(Present Value Interest Factors for One Dollar Discounted at _k_ Percent for _n_ Periods: PVIF\) <!--SR:!2025-11-13,140,424!2025-11-12,141,425-->
  - present value / annuity ::@:: The present value, if you add a fixed amount of money at the _end_ (not the _start_) of each period. So it always starts with a number smaller than 1. <p> Look up in a table... \(Present Value Interest Factors for a One-Dollar Annuity Discounted at _k_ Percent for _n_ Periods: PVIFA\) <!--SR:!2025-11-14,143,425!2025-11-17,144,425-->
- [future value](../../../../general/future%20value.md) ::@:: Money obtained in the present has more value in the future due to interest rate. <p> Present value and future value are related by: $$\text{FV} = (1 + r)^t \text{PV} \,,$$ where $r$ is the interest rate in a time period, and $t$ is the number (can be fractional) of time periods. Or just look up in a table... \(Future Value Interest Factors for One Dollar Compounded at _k_ Percent for _n_ Periods: FVIF\) <!--SR:!2025-11-14,142,425!2025-11-21,148,425-->
  - future value / annuity ::@:: The future value at the _ending_ period, if you add a fixed amount of money at the _end_ (not the _start_) of each period. So it always starts with 1. <p> Look up in a table... \(Future Value Interest Factors for a One-Dollar Annuity Compounded at _k_ Percent for _n_ Periods: FVIFA\) <!--SR:!2025-11-13,149,421!2025-11-20,149,425-->
- [annuity](../../../../general/annuity.md) ::@:: It is a series of payments made at equal intervals. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,136,421!2025-11-14,142,424-->
- [internal rate of return](../../../../general/internal%20rate%20of%20return.md) \(IRR\) ::@:: It is a method of calculating an investment's rate of return. The term _internal_ refers to the fact that the calculation excludes external factors, such as the risk-free rate, inflation, the cost of capital, or financial risk. <!--SR:!2025-11-11,140,425!2025-11-21,149,421-->
  - internal rate of return / application timing ::@:: The method may be applied either ex-post (after) or ex-ante (before). Applied ex-ante, the IRR is an estimate of a future annual rate of return. Applied ex-post, it measures the actual achieved investment return of a historical investment. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,142,425!2025-11-16,143,424-->
  - internal rate of return / definition ::@:: It of an investment or project is the "annualized effective compounded return rate" or rate of return that sets the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows (both positive and negative) from the investment equal to zero. <!--SR:!2025-11-11,139,421!2025-11-18,145,421-->
  - internal rate of return / calculation ::@:: Similar to calculating interest rate, there is no closed formula for it. Either use Microsoft Excel, a financial calculator, or use trial-and-error. <!--SR:!2025-11-22,149,425!2025-11-12,140,425-->
  - internal rate of return / interpretation ::@:: It measures the _average return_ of an investment, or the _average interest rate_ of a loan/delayed investment, independent of the actual interest rate/cost of capital. <p> It also measures the _sensitivity_ of the NPV to measurement errors in the cost of capital. The difference between the cost of capital and the IRR is the error margin: By how much your cost of capital can be wrong without changing your decision? \(It applies for both investment and loan/delayed investment.\) <!--SR:!2025-11-14,141,425!2025-11-09,137,425-->
  - internal rate of return / intuition ::@:: It is the discount rate needed to make all cash flows now and in the future to have a net present value of zero. Notice that it does not distinguish between inflow and outflow: Both are discounted by equal amount given that they have the same timing. This means if more inflows are in the farther future, inflows are discounted more. Same goes for outflows. <p> This explains the difference in the decision rules for investment and loan/delayed investment. In the former, the cash flows being discounted are the inflows. Higher IRR means the inflows are worth more to begin with before being discounted. So higher is better. In the latter the cash flows being discounted are the outflows. Higher IRR means the outflows are worth more to begin with before being discounted. So lower is better. <!--SR:!2025-11-13,142,421!2025-11-23,150,425-->
  - internal rate of return / weakness ::@:: It generally cannot be used for non-conventional cash flows \(neither an investment nor a loan/delayed investment\). <p> For mutually exclusive projects, IRR is _scale-independent_ and _timing-dependent_, so it is not suitable. <p> Since all cash flows are assumed to be discounted at the internal rate of return, this means we are assuming an environment where all cash inflows can be \(re-\)invested at the internal rate of return rather than the cost of capital. For an investment with high IRR, this may over-estimate the return. <!--SR:!2025-11-19,147,425!2025-11-21,148,425-->
  - internal rate of return / decision rule ::@:: For a standalone investment, _accept_ those with an IRR of _at least_ the cost of capital. _Reject_ others. For a standalone loan/delayed investment, _accept_ those with an IRR _not higher than_ the cost of capital. _Reject_ others. These rules are _consistent_ (i.e. make the same decision) as that for NPV, given that projects are of _similar_ _duration_/_life_, _scale_, and _timing_. <p> For non-conventional cash flows (neither an investment nor a loan/delayed investment) or mutually exclusive projects, IRR is generally unsuitable, and we should use NPV or other rules instead. <!--SR:!2027-04-23,581,425!2025-11-20,147,425-->
- [profitability index](../../../../general/profitability%20index.md) \(PI\) ::@:: It is the ratio of payoff to investment of a proposed project. It is a useful tool for ranking projects because it allows you to quantify the amount of value created per unit of investment. <!--SR:!2025-11-19,146,425!2025-11-23,151,425-->
  - profitability index / calculation ::@:: The ratio is calculated as follows: $${\text{Profitability index} }={\frac {\text{PV of future cash flows} }{\text{Initial investment} } }=1+{\frac {\text{NPV} }{\text{Initial investment} } } \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-11-12,141,425!2025-11-20,149,425-->
  - profitability index / interpretation ::@::Assuming that the [cash flow](../../../../general/cash%20flow.md) calculated does not include the investment made in the project, a profitability index of 1 indicates break-even. Any value lower than one would indicate that the project's present value \([PV](../../../../general/present%20value.md)\) is less than the initial investment. As the value of the profitability index increases, so does the financial attractiveness of the proposed project. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,145,421!2025-11-16,143,425-->
- net present value
  - net present value / decision rule ::@:: For standalone projects \(i.e. either take or leave\), _accept_ positive NPV projects. _Reject_ negative NPV projects. _Accept_ zero NPV projects unless you have good \(non-financial\) reasons to not to, for the reasons described above. \(__this course__: indifferent for zero NPV projects\) <p> To choose among mutually exclusive projects, choose the alternative with the _highest non-negative_ NPV. If all projects have negative NPV, then _reject all_. <!--SR:!2025-11-13,141,425!2025-11-12,140,425-->
  - net present value / NPV profile ::@:: It is a _xy_-plot that, given a cost of capital, shows the NPV of an investment or loan/delayed investment. The point where the graph crosses _y_ = 0 \(zero NPV\) has an _x_ value that is the _internal rate of return_ \(IRR\). <p> For an investment, the graph is decreasing. For a loan/delayed investment, the graph is increasing. <p> Note that for unconventional cash flows, all of the above \(include increasing/decreasing graphs\) may not be true. In fact, it is possible to have multiple points where the graph crosses _y_ = 0, yielding _multiple IRRs_. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,144,425!2025-11-16,145,421-->
  - net present value / incremental ::@:: When using incremental NPV to compare two choices, identify which one is the "default" choice. Then the incremental cash flows are computed by subtracting the other choice by the "default" choice. <p> The decision rule is the same. <!--SR:!2027-04-13,563,425!2025-11-13,140,425-->
  - net present value / note ::@:: \(__this course__: Ideally, use a _table_ to calculate the NPV. _Manufacturing-related_ depreciation can sometimes be considered part of fixed manufacturing costs. When you sell an asset, you need to use its after-tax salvage value if calculating _cash flow_.\) <!--SR:!2025-11-14,141,425!2027-06-01,597,425-->
- profitability index
  - profitability index / use ::@:: It is used to prioritize non-mutually exclusive investment projects given limited capital. The higher the index, the higher its priority. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,146,421!2027-12-17,770,441-->

- topic: capital budgeting
- [free cash flow](../../../../general/free%20cash%20flow.md) \(FCF\) ::@:: It is the amount by which a business's operating cash flow exceeds its working capital needs and expenditures on fixed assets \(known as capital expenditures\). It is that portion of cash flow that can be extracted from a company and distributed to creditors and securities holders without causing issues in its operations. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,144,425!2025-11-16,144,425-->
  - free cash flow / tax ::@:: Calculated as EBIT × _marginal_ corporate tax rate. It is a cash outflow. If negative, it becomes _tax credit_ and is a cash inflow. \(In accounting, the treatment of taxes is much more complicated.\) <p> Note that since FCF is usually _unlevered_, i.e. exclude effects of debt, tax shield due to interest expense is ignored. This explains why tax is calculated using EBIT instead of \(EBIT – interest\), even though the _actual_ tax is based on the latter. <!--SR:!2025-11-10,137,425!2025-11-19,146,425-->
  - free cash flow / incremental earnings ::@:: Note that since FCF is usually _unlevered_, i.e. exclude effects of debt, tax shield due to interest expense is also ignored \(apart from ignoring interest expense\). Thus, the incremental earnings calculate tax using EBIT instead of \(EBIT – interest\). Hence, incremental earnings is also called _unlevered_ net income. <!--SR:!2025-11-11,140,425!2025-11-21,148,425-->
  - free cash flow / interest expense ::@:: Interest expense and tax shield due to interest expense is not included. <p> The motivation is FCF is cash distributable to both stockholders and _debt holders_. So a project should be judged with its operating cost, not financing cost. <p> The debt—equity mix should be considered separately. <!--SR:!2025-11-12,139,421!2025-11-19,147,425-->
- [tax shield](../../../../general/tax%20shield.md) ::@:: It is the reduction in income taxes that results from taking an allowable deduction from taxable income. For example, because interest on debt is a tax-deductible expense, taking on debt creates a tax shield. <p> \(Note that FCF is usually _unlevered_, so debt tax shield is excluded.\) <!--SR:!2025-11-16,143,425!2025-11-12,139,421-->
  - tax shield / importance ::@:: Since a tax shield is a way to save cash flows, it increases the value of the business, and it is an important aspect of business valuation. <!--SR:!2025-11-13,141,425!2025-11-15,142,425-->
  - tax shield / free cash flow ::@:: When calculating incremental earnings/_unlevered_ net income, depreciation is subtracted before applying the tax rate. Then, when calculating FCF, depreciation is added back. <p> With the tax shield approach, when calculating FCF, depreciation is _not_ subtracted before applying the tax rate. After applying the tax rate, depreciation _multiplied by the tax rate_ is added back. This is mathematically equivalent to the previous paragraph. <p> Note that FCF is usually _unlevered_, so debt tax shield is excluded. <!--SR:!2025-11-12,139,425!2025-11-17,144,425-->
    - tax shield / free cash flow / application ::@:: The tax shield approach is very good for simplifying calculations, as long as you understand it. For example, it can be used to compute the change in FCF after buying an equipment due to depreciation. <!--SR:!2025-11-21,149,425!2025-11-20,147,425-->
- net book value
  - net book value / after-tax salvage value ::@:: The difference between the actual sale value and the net book value is the gain or loss from selling the asset in accounting. This gain or loss is subject to tax. If you have gain, you have tax due. If you have loss, you have tax credit. <p> Thus, the actual cash flow is the actual sale value and the tax effect: $$\text{after-tax salvage value} = \text{sale price} - \text{gain} \times \text{corporate marginal tax rate} \,.$$ For loss, the "gain" is negative, so the above equation still applies. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,143,425!2025-11-21,149,424-->

## week 13 makeup lecture

- datetime: not applicable
- topic: decentralized performance evaluation
- [decentralization](../../../../general/decentralization.md) ::@:: It is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those related to planning and decision-making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group and given to smaller factions within it. <!--SR:!2025-11-22,149,425!2025-11-12,140,425-->
  - decentralization / responsibility ::@:: Decentralization often occurs as organization grows. Smaller decisions often get pushed to lower level managers. This decentralizes _responsibility_. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,143,425!2025-11-23,150,425-->
    - decentralization / responsibility / advantages ::@:: develop managerial expertise <br/> free up time for strategic issues for higher level managers <br/> lower level managers can make more informed \(more knowledge in their responsible areas\) and quicker decisions <!--SR:!2025-11-12,140,421!2027-03-06,541,425-->
    - decentralization / responsibility / disadvantages ::@:: duplication of resources performing the same functions in multiple areas <br/> principal–agent problem: managers may make decisions that benefit themselves but not necessarily the organization as a whole <!--SR:!2025-11-08,135,425!2025-11-25,152,425-->
- [responsibility center](../../../../general/responsibility%20center.md) ::@:: It is an organizational unit headed by a manager, who is responsible for its activities and results. In responsibility accounting, revenues and cost information are collected and reported on by responsibility centers. <!--SR:!2027-12-13,766,441!2025-11-15,142,425-->
  - responsibility center / responsibility accounting ::@:: It supports __responsibility accounting__, which allows managers to be responsible for a _particular_ area of an organization and _only_ for that area. Then, performance can be evaluated based on centers. <!--SR:!2025-11-20,147,425!2025-11-11,139,425-->
  - responsibility center / types ::@:: 4 common ones: cost center, investment center, profit center, revenue center <!--SR:!2025-11-25,152,425!2025-11-25,152,425-->
  - responsibility center / cost center ::@:: It is characterized by the lowest level of responsibility compared to the other two centers. Their managers are expected to produce as much output with a fixed amount of resources/input and to reduce costs. <p> Managers are generally evaluated based on cost control and reduction as they have no delegation to increase sales generation. <p> Examples include purchasing managers. <!--SR:!2025-11-25,152,425!2027-05-19,585,424-->
  - responsibility center / revenue center ::@:: It is characterized by the lowest level of responsibility compared to the other two centers. Their managers are expected to generate as much revenue by increasing sales. <p> Managers are generally evaluated based on sales and revenue generation. <p> Examples include account managers of online sales team. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,145,421!2025-11-15,142,425-->
  - responsibility center / profit center ::@:: It  is characterized by the responsibility to choose inputs and outputs with a fixed level of investment. <p> A typical measurement for profit center management is the ability to maximize profits as they are responsible for both costs and revenues. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,143,425!2025-11-23,150,425-->
  - responsibility center / investment center ::@:: It has the highest level of delegated autonomy. Investment center's have the highest level of autonomy as they can determine the level of inputs, outputs and additional investments. <p> The most common metric for evaluating management performance is the return on investment \(ROI\). The unit can be held responsible for generating an adequate ROI as the business unit has the autonomy to determine the key influencing variables. <p> Examples include real estate managers. <!--SR:!2025-11-10,137,425!2025-11-11,138,424-->
- [transfer pricing](../../../../general/transfer%20pricing.md) ::@:: It refers to the rules and methods for pricing transactions within and between enterprises under common ownership or control. <!--SR:!2025-11-23,150,425!2025-11-19,146,421-->
  - transfer pricing / range ::@:: The floor is the unit variable cost, otherwise the selling division would have negative contribution margin and not produce the product \(shutdown\). <p> The ceiling is the market price, otherwise the purchasing division would buy from the market directly. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,145,421!2025-11-08,135,421-->
  - transfer pricing / methods ::@:: cost-based method \(floor, approximately\), negotiation, market-price method \(ceiling\) <!--SR:!2025-11-25,152,424!2028-02-04,821,445-->
  - transfer pricing / market-price method ::@:: Use the market price \(ceiling\), the price a company would charge to external customers. <p> It is appropriate when the selling division has no excess capacity, since the selling division would have opportunity cost equaling the market price. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,143,425!2025-11-14,142,424-->
  - transfer pricing / cost-based method ::@:: Use the unit variable cost \(floor\), unit full cost, or unit variable cost with percent markup. Any transfer price above the unit variable cost provides contribution margin to the selling division. <p> It is appropriate when the selling division has excess/idle capacity \(usually due to insufficient or no market demand\), since the selling division have zero opportunity cost. <!--SR:!2025-11-13,140,421!2028-01-17,805,444-->
  - transfer pricing / negotiation ::@:: Price is determined by negotiation between managers of the selling division and purchasing division. <p> The resulting price depends on capacity of the selling division and their relative negotiating power \(the more power a division has, the more favorable the transfer price is to the division\). <p> Disadvantages include management time used on negotiation and potentially creating adversarial relations between divisions. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,137,425!2025-11-22,151,425-->
  - transfer pricing / effect ::@:: Assume the pricing is in between the floor and the ceiling. Then the transfer price determines the amount of benefits received by the selling division \(contribution margin/_gain_\) and purchasing division \(_savings_ compared to buying from the market\). <!--SR:!2025-11-20,148,425!2025-11-19,147,421-->

- topic: decentralized performance evaluation
- [balanced scorecard](../../../../general/balanced%20scorecard.md) ::@:: It is a strategy performance management tool – a well-structured report used to keep track of the execution of activities by staff and to monitor the consequences arising from these actions. <!--SR:!2026-01-05,164,442!2026-01-05,164,442-->
  - balanced scorecard / motivation ::@:: Management wants to execute its strategy. It needs a way to track the execution using performance measures. Employees can also understand and accept these measures to know how to improve themselves. <!--SR:!2025-12-24,154,442!2026-01-03,164,442-->
  - balanced scorecard / first generation ::@:: The first generation of balanced scorecard designs used a "four perspective" approach to identify what measures to use to track the implementation of strategy. The original four "perspectives" proposed were: \(results\) _financial_ ← _customer_ ← _internal business processes_ ← _learning and growth_ \(causes\). <!--SR:!2026-01-05,164,442!2026-01-04,163,442-->
    - balanced scorecard / first generation / financial ::@:: It encourages the identification of a few relevant high-level financial measures. In particular, designers were encouraged to choose measures that helped inform the answer to the question "How do we look to shareholders?". <!--SR:!2026-01-03,164,442!2026-01-05,164,442-->
      - balanced scorecard / first generation / financial / measures ::@:: cash flow, economic value added \(EVA\), profitability, residual income, return on investment \(ROI\), sales growth, etc. <!--SR:!2026-01-02,163,442!2025-11-15,115,422-->
    - balanced scorecard / first generation / customer ::@:: It encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "What is important to our customers and stakeholders?". <!--SR:!2026-01-04,163,442!2025-12-24,161,442-->
      - balanced scorecard / first generation / customer / measures ::@:: customer satisfaction, market share, on time delivery, percent of sales from new products, share of important customers' purchases, etc. <!--SR:!2025-12-29,159,442!2025-12-18,148,442-->
    - balanced scorecard / first generation / internal business processes ::@:: It encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "What must we excel at?" or "What do we need to meet the needs of our customers, employees, and stakeholders?". <!--SR:!2026-01-03,164,442!2025-12-18,148,442-->
      - balanced scorecard / first generation / internal business processes / measures ::@:: average days to market, cycle time, defective rate, inventory stock outs, percent of new products, unit cost, yield, etc. <!--SR:!2026-01-03,164,442!2026-01-04,163,442-->
    - balanced scorecard / first generation / learning and growth ::@:: It encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "How can we continue to improve, create value and innovate?". <!--SR:!2026-01-05,164,442!2026-01-01,160,442-->
      - balanced scorecard / first generation / learning and growth / measures ::@:: employee satisfaction, lifecycle to product maturity, number of new patent applications, research and development \(R&D\) spending, time to market versus competition, etc. <!--SR:!2026-01-02,163,442!2026-01-04,163,442-->
- [return on investment](../../../../general/return%20on%20investment.md) \(ROI\) ::@:: It is the ratio between net income \(over a period\) and investment \(costs resulting from an investment of some resources at a point in time\). <!--SR:!2026-01-03,164,442!2025-12-24,161,442-->
  - return on investment / formula ::@:: $$\text{ROI} = \frac {\text{NOI} } {\text{AIA} } \,,$$ where ROI is return on investment, NOI is net operating income, and AIA is average invested assets. Expanding: $$\text{ROI} = \text{IT} \cdot \text{PM} = \frac {\text{SR} } {\text{AIA} } \cdot \frac {\text{NOI} } {\text{SR} } \,,$$ where IT is investment turnover, PM is profit margin, and SR is sales revenue. <!--SR:!2025-11-08,108,422!2026-01-04,163,442-->
  - return on investment / average invested assets ::@:: Take the average of the invested assets at year start and year end. <!--SR:!2026-01-05,164,442!2026-01-04,163,442-->
  - return on investment / investment turnover ::@:: Literally just $$\text{investment turnover} = \frac {\text{sales revenue} } {\text{average invested assets} } \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-12-17,147,442!2026-01-05,164,442-->
  - return on investment / profit margin ::@:: Literally just $$\text{profit margin} = \frac {\text{net operating income} } {\text{sales revenue} } \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-12-22,152,442!2026-01-04,163,442-->
- [residual income valuation](../../../../general/residual%20income%20valuation.md) \(RIV\) ::@:: It is an approach to [equity valuation](../../../../general/equity%20valuation.md) that formally accounts for the [cost of equity](../../../../general/cost%20of%20equity.md) capital. Here, "residual" means in excess of any [opportunity costs](../../../../general/opportunity%20cost.md) measured relative to the book value of [shareholders' equity](../../../../general/shareholders'%20equity.md); __residual income__ \(RI\) is then the income generated by a firm after accounting for the true [cost of capital](../../../../general/cost%20of%20capital.md). <!--SR:!2026-01-04,163,442!2026-01-04,163,442-->
  - residual income valuation / residual income ::@:: It is computed as: $$\text{net operating income} - \text{minimum acceptable profit} \,,$$ where the minimum acceptable profit can be computed as: $$\text{average invested assets} \cdot \text{hurdle rate} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-12-19,149,442!2026-01-03,164,442-->
    - residual income valuation / residual income / return on investment ::@:: It can be computed from return on investment: $$\text{average invested assets} \cdot \text{residual return} \,,$$ where residual return is computed as: $$\text{return on investment} - \text{hurdle rate} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-01-02,163,442!2026-01-05,164,442-->
  - residual income valuation / hurdle rate ::@:: It is the required return on invested assets, sometimes called the _required rate of return_. <!--SR:!2026-01-05,164,442!2026-01-03,164,442-->
  - residual income valuation / interpretation ::@:: It is a company's extra profit that is in excess of needed to meet the required rate of return. <!--SR:!2026-01-05,164,442!2026-01-04,163,442-->
  - residual income valuation / characteristics ::@:: It is _scale-variant_, i.e. takes project _scale_ \(average invested assets\) into account. <p> It is a _lagging_ indicator of financial performance, based on historical financial information, and does not necessarily predict future performance. <p> Using this as a measure may cause managers to focus on short-term financial results only. <!--SR:!2026-01-04,163,442!2026-01-02,161,442-->
- return on investment
  - return on investment / characteristics ::@:: It is _scale-invariant_, i.e. does not take project _scale_ \(average invested assets\) into account. So managers may make wrong decisions if ROI is used as the only performance measure. <p> It is a _lagging_ indicator of financial performance, based on historical financial information, and does not necessarily predict future performance. <p> Using this as a measure may cause managers to focus on short-term financial results only. <!--SR:!2026-01-03,164,442!2025-12-23,153,442-->
- [triple bottom line](../../../../general/triple%20bottom%20line.md) \(TBL\) ::@:: It is an accounting framework with three parts: _social_, _environmental_ \(or ecological\) and _economic_. Some organizations have adopted the TBL framework to evaluate their performance in a broader perspective to create greater business value. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,143,425!2025-11-25,152,425-->
  - triple bottom line / social ::@:: The people, social equity, or human capital bottom line pertains to fair and beneficial business practices toward labour and the community and region in which a corporation conducts its business. A TBL company conceives a reciprocal social structure in which the well-being of corporate, labour and other stakeholder interests are interdependent. <!--SR:!2025-11-13,141,425!2025-11-24,152,425-->
  - triple bottom line / environmental ::@:: The planet, environmental bottom line, or natural capital bottom line refers to sustainable environmental practices. A TBL company endeavors to benefit the natural order as much as possible or at the least do no harm and minimize environmental impact. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,144,425!2025-11-13,140,421-->
  - triple bottom line / economic ::@:: The profit or economic bottom line deals with the economic value created by the organization after deducting the cost of all inputs, including the cost of the capital tied up. It therefore differs from traditional accounting definitions of profit. In the original concept, within a sustainability framework, the "profit" aspect needs to be seen as the real economic benefit enjoyed by the host society. It is the real economic impact the organization has on its economic environment. <!--SR:!2025-11-22,150,425!2025-11-19,146,425-->
    - triple bottom line / economic / confusion ::@:: This is often confused to be limited to the internal profit made by a company or organization \(which nevertheless remains an essential starting point for the computation\). Therefore, an original TBL approach cannot be interpreted as simply traditional corporate accounting profit _plus_ social and environmental impacts unless the "profits" of other entities are included as a social benefit. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,141,425!2027-03-13,547,425-->

    - residual income approach \(−2\) ::@:: They need you to calculate the residual income of the \(incremental\) project only as well; that is, you need to calculate the original residual income, the project only residual income, and the new residual income. <!--SR:!2026-01-05,164,442!2026-01-04,163,442-->
    - return on investment approach \(−2\) ::@:: They need you to calculate the return on investment \(ROI\) of the \(incremental\) project only as well; that is, you need to calculate the project only ROI and the new ROI \(the original ROI is also calculated but carries no marks\). <!--SR:!2025-12-31,161,442!2026-01-04,163,442-->
  - question 4: capital budgeting \(−9\) ::@:: Given three paragraphs of text, use net present value \(NPV\) to decide if a project is worth it. <!--SR:!2026-01-01,162,442!2026-01-04,163,442-->
    - delayed tax savings \(−3\) ::@:: It turns out they define tax savings as tax savings due to depreciation only \(and potentially loss from sale on assets, but not sure\), not tax savings due to negative operating income. Also, operating expenses are excluded. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,115,422!2025-12-30,160,442-->
    - final answer \(−2\) ::@:: Hard to obtain, since it requires you to do the work of a spreadsheet software. Honestly they could have deducted more, from their marking scheme. <!--SR:!2025-12-22,152,442!2026-01-03,164,442-->
    - sale on assets \(−4\) ::@:: Probably presentation problem. Better to calculate the after-tax operating income, then add the sale on assets, and then remove the tax on gain from sale on assets. <!--SR:!2026-01-05,164,442!2027-01-26,445,422-->
