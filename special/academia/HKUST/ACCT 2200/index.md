  - types of costs / variability ::@:: variable vs. fixed <!--SR:!2025-02-08,4,270!2025-02-08,4,270-->
- [direct costs](../../../../general/direct%20costs.md) ::@:: convenient and easily traceable to a cost object, e.g. cost of labors and materials to produce a product <!--SR:!2025-02-08,4,270!2025-02-08,4,270-->
  - [cost object](../../../../general/cost%20object.md) ::@:: a term used primarily in cost accounting to describe something to which costs are assigned <!--SR:!2025-02-08,4,270!2025-02-08,4,270-->

  - [direct labor cost](../../../../general/direct%20labor%20cost.md) ::@:: labor cost that are conveniently and easily traceable to the final product,e.g. wages to assembly line workers, wages to cooks, but _not_ wages to directors <!--SR:!2025-02-08,4,270!2025-02-08,4,270-->
  - [manufacturing overhead](../../../../general/overhead%20(business).md) (MOH) ::@:: all costs needed to manufacture a product that are neither direct materials nor direct labor (i.e. indirect costs), e.g. depreciation, maintenance, insurance, property taxes, repairs, utilities, wages to supervisors <!--SR:!2025-02-15,8,250!2025-02-08,4,270-->

  - non-manufacturing cost ::@:: includes all other costs that are not manufacturing costs, e.g. general & administration (G&A), marketing, selling <!--SR:!2025-02-08,4,270!2025-02-08,4,270-->
- product cost ::@:: cost that is incurred per product, e.g. manufacturing costs; goes to "cost of goods sold", and generates future benefits <!--SR:!2025-02-08,4,270!2025-02-08,4,270-->
- period cost ::@:: cost that is incurred periodically, e.g. non-manufacturing costs; goes to "period expenses", and does not generate future benefits (directly) <!--SR:!2025-02-08,4,270!2025-02-08,4,270-->
- [relevant cost](../../../../genera/relevant%20cost.md) ::@:: a cost that has potential to influence decision making, which differs between decision alternatives (differential/incremental costs) and must be incurred in the future (non-sunk costs) <!--SR:!2025-02-08,4,270!2025-02-08,4,270-->
  - irrelevant cost ::@:: costs that are not relevant, e.g. amortization, depreciation, sunk costs <!--SR:!2025-02-08,4,270!2025-02-08,4,270-->
- out-of-pocket costs (explicit cost in economics) ::@:: costs that involve actual outgoing cash <!--SR:!2025-02-08,4,270!2025-02-08,4,270-->
