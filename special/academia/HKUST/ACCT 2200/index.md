- topic: job order costing
- [job costing](../../../../general/job%20costing.md) ::@:: accounting which tracks the costs and revenues by "job" and enables standardized reporting of profitability by job
  - job costing / the other costing method ::@:: process costing
  - job costing / vs. process costing ::@:: approach, cost accumulation, product type, report types
    - job costing / vs. process costing / approach ::@:: customized to the needs of clients or customers; mass produced using standardized processes
    - job costing / vs. process costing / cost accumulation ::@:: accumulates per customer/project/job; accumulates per process
    - job costing / vs. process costing / product type ::@:: unique products and services (e.g. construction projects); homogeneous products and services (e.g. soft drinks)
    - job costing / vs. process costing / report types ::@:: job cost sheet per customer/project/job; production report per process
  - job cost / manufacturing costs ::@:: direct materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead; add them together
  - job cost / source documents ::@:: documents to assign direct costs to jobs; direct materials: materials requisition form, direct labor: labor time ticket
  - job cost / materials requisition form ::@:: The form should have "Materials Requisition Form", a number (e.g. MR 42), date, job number (e.g. 42), description, a table listing the materials, and an authorized signature. <p> The table should contain a row for each type of materials. The columns are "Material Description" (include numbers or sizes if needed), "Quantity", "Unit Cost", and "Total Cost". Also calculate the "Total Cost" for the entire table for "Total Cost".
  - job cost / (direct) labor time ticket ::@:: The form should have "Direct Labor Time Ticket", dates (e.g. Monday 2/10—Friday 2/14, 2025), ticket number (e.g. TT 42), employee, a table listing the labor, and an authorized signature. <p> The table should contain a row for each consecutive working period. The columns are "Date", "Time Started", "Time Ended", "Total Hours", "Hourly Rate', "Total Amount", and "Job Number" (cell values may be text, e.g. "Training"). Also calculate the "Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Whatever Total" for the entire table for "Total Hours" and "Total Amount".
  - job cost / job cost sheet ::@:: The form should have "Job Cost Sheet", job number (e.g. 42), date started, date completed, description, 3 tables in the middle (resp. with the header "Actual Direct Materials", "Actual Direct Labor", "Applied Manufacturing Overhead"), and a bottom section with the header "Cost Summary". <p> For the table "Actual Direct Materials", the columns are "Req. No" and "Amount". For the table "Actual Direct Labor", the columns are "Ticket", "Hours", and "Amount". For the table "Applied Manufacturing Overhead", the columns are (unit for primary cost driver, e.g. "Hours" for label) and "Amount". <p> For the section "Cost Summary", write the 3 numbers above vertically and label them, and then calculate the "Total Cost" for this job.
  - job cost / [manufacturing overhead](../../../../general/factory%20overhead.md) (MOH) ::@:: Applied Manufacturing Overhead = Predetermined Overhead Rate (POHR) × Actual Cost Driver <p> The actual cost driver/allocation base may be direct labor costs (less common), direct labor hours (more common), direct materials costs, etc.
    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / rationale & handling ::@:: Such costs may be impossible or difficult to trace to particular jobs, consists of many different items, and may not be known until the end of a period. <p> So what we do is identify the cost driver (e.g. direct labor costs, direct labor hours, direct materials costs) and use it as an allocation base. Then use estimates to find the predetermined overhead rate (POHR). This rate is "predetermined" because it is determined before a period begins.
    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / underapplied & overapplied ::@:: The _applied_ manufacturing overhead found using POHR is only an _estimate_. At the end of a period, we can find the _actual_ manufacturing overhead. If applied MOH > actual MOH then it is overapplied, and vice versa. If applied MOH < actual MOH then it is underapplied. <p> This discrepancy is accounted for by adjusting the cost of goods sold (COGS), which will be discussed below.

A _debit_ entry in an account represents a transfer of value _to_ that account, and a _credit_ entry represents a transfer _from_ the account.
  - debits and credits / T account ::@:: Draw a (big) "T". Write the account name (and optionally its type) on above the "T". Add a header for each of the two spaces below the horizontal line of the "T": "Debits (Dr)" on the left, "Credits (Cr)" on the right. Optionally, write "Increase" and "Decrease" above the account name, labeling which side is the _normal_ balance.
    - debits and credits / T account / recording ::@:: For each change to the account, write a number on either the left or the right side, depending on if it is a debit or credit. Optionally, label the number with a brief description. <p> To calculate the final account balance, draw a horizontal line below all the numbers.

## week 2 lecture 2

- datetime: 2025-02-12T12:00:00+08:00/2025-02-12T13:20:00+08:00
- topic: process costing
- [process costing](../../../../general/process%20costing.md) ::@:: an accounting methodology that traces and accumulates direct costs, and allocates indirect costs of a manufacturing process
  - process costing / the other costing method ::@:: job costing
  - process costing / use ::@:: For _homogeneous_ products or services produced by standardized processes. <p> Product examples: bottled goods, canned goods, frozen food, paper products, petroleum products, etc. <br/> Service examples: claims and reimbursement process (insurance companies), home finance loans (financial institutions).
  - process costing / overview ::@:: Raw material costs are first added to raw materials inventory. Then when they enter a process, the cost is transferred into the process's "direct materials" account. Conversion costs (direct labor + MOH) are directly added into the process's "conversion cost" account. <p> A unit may require multiple processes. When a unit is transferred from a process to another, we also need to transfer its corresponding cost, so we need to find out per unit cost in a process, which is what process costing does.
  - process costing / data ::@:: In a process, you need to track 4 things: direct materials (account), conversion cost (account), number of units in inventory (including new, WIP, and completed units), and percentage of completion (i.e. how much of units in the inventory are complete). <p> To do costing, first obtain the number for these 4 things at period start and period end.
    - process costing / data / direct materials ::@:: Basically just add the direct materials issued to the process during this period.
    - process costing / data / conversion cost ::@:: Basically just add the conversion cost (direct labor + MOH) issued to the process during this period.
    - process costing / data / number of units in inventory ::@:: Count the units at period start and at period end. Also record how many unit started for production during this period. Then we can compute how many units have been transferred away (of course, the unit must be completed by the current process for it to be transferred away).
    - process costing / data / percentage of completion ::@:: It is likely given the question. It only considers units that are in the inventory at period start and period end. <p> For weighted average cost, we do not need the number for period start.
  - process costing / steps ::@:: find physical units (transferred) → convert physical units into equivalent units → calculate cost per equivalent unit → reconcile costs (using per unit cost) → prepare production reports
  - process costing / methods ::@:: first-in, first-out (FIFO), weighted average cost, etc.
  - process costing / equivalent units ::@:: Remember in accounting, costs are only incurred when the performance happens. Since not all physical units in an inventory have been finished, equivalent units account for this by multiplying the completion percentage. <p> Note that it is calculated separately for direct materials (materials may not be all added at the process start) and conversion cost (WIP units).
  - process costing / weighted average cost ::@:: Essentially, the per unit cost is calculated by dividing the _ending_ direct materials and _ending_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units.
    - process costing / weighted average cost / find physical units ::@:: Compute units transferred (which must be completed for them to be transferred in the first place). <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / weighted average cost / find physical units / table ::@:: row headers: Units (values: Physical Units), Units to be accounted for:, Beginning Inventory, Started this period, Total units
    - process costing / weighted average cost / convert physical units into equivalent units ::@:: Calculate equivalent units separately for direct materials and conversion cost. <p> Transferred (hence completed) physical units become equivalent units one-to-one (factor of 100%). Physical units in ending inventory are multiplied by the appropriate factors to become equivalent units. <p> For direct materials, multiply by the percentage of required materials added. (This is 100% if all materials have been added at the beginning.) For conversion cost, multiply by the completion percentage of the ending inventory. (This number is usually given.) <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / weighted average cost / convert physical units into equivalent units / table ::@:: row headers: Units accounted for: (values: Physical Units, Direct Materials, Conversion), Completed/Transferred, Ending Inventory, Total units
    - process costing / weighted average cost / calculate cost per equivalent unit ::@:: Divide _ending_ direct materials and _ending_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units. <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / weighted average cost / calculate cost per equivalent unit / table ::@:: row headers: Cost: Cost to be accounted for: (values: Direct Materials, Conversion, Total), Beginning inventory, Cost added in this period, Total cost, Equivalent units (values: ÷ ???; for total, omit), Cost per equivalent unit (values: for total, add the two numbers on the left)
    - process costing / weighted average cost / reconcile costs ::@:: Convert units into costs. <p> Calculate direct materials, conversion, and _total_ separately for 2 things: units transferred (hence completed) and _ending_ inventory; using per equivalent unit costs and equivalent (_not_ physical) units. (Actually you should see, combining this step and the previous step, this is just splitting the costs using equivalent units.) <p> The cost of goods transferred is the total cost for everything excluding the _ending_ inventory. Transfer this value to the next process's work in progress inventory or finished goods inventory using a T entry. <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / weighted average cost / reconcile costs / table ::@:: row headers: Cost accounted for: (values: Direct Material, Conversion, Total), Cost of units completed, Ending inventory, Total costs
    - process costing / weighted average cost / prepare production reports ::@:: The report consists of 3 sections. For each section, the headers are "Section (#) of Production Report", "(company name)", "Process Costing Production Report (Weighted Average Method)", "(process name) Process", "For (time, e.g. the Quarter Ended March 31, 2025)". <p> Section 1 is merging the tables from step 1 and step 2. Section 2 is the table from step 3. Section 3 is the table from step 4. <p> Formatting: Add dollar signs if needed to the first and last currency number in the same column. Underline total costs in section 3.
  - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) ::@:: Essentially, the per unit cost for _newly added_ materials and conversion is calculated by dividing the _added_ direct materials and _added_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units. Units in the _starting_ inventory are assumed to be finished and transferred first, hence FIFO.
    - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / find physical units ::@:: Compute units transferred (which must be completed for them to be transferred in the first place). Then compute units that are started (_not_ in the _starting_ inventory) and transferred during this period. Using FIFO, we assume units in the _starting_ inventory are completed first. <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / find physical units / table ::@:: row headers: Units (values: Physical Units), Units to be accounted for:, Beginning Inventory, Started this period, Total units
    - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / convert physical units into equivalent units ::@:: Calculate equivalent units separately for direct materials and conversion cost. <p> Physical units in starting inventory _completed_ and transferred first. Multiply by the appropriate factors to become equivalent units. For direct materials, multiply by the percentage of _remaining_ required materials. (This is 0% if all materials have been added at the beginning). For conversion cost, multiply by the _remaining_ completion percentage. (The completion percentage is usually given, but you need to 100% − _x_ the number to get the _remaining_ completion percentage.) <p> Transferred (hence completed) physical units that are _started_ in this period become equivalent units one-to-one (factor of 100%). <p> Physical units in ending inventory are multiplied by the appropriate factors to become equivalent units. For direct materials, multiply by the percentage of required materials added. (This is 100% if all materials have been added at the beginning.) For conversion cost, multiply by the completion percentage of the ending inventory. (This number is usually given.) <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / convert physical units into equivalent units / table ::@:: row headers: Units accounted for: (values: Physical Units, Direct Materials, Conversion), Beginning Work in Progress, Completed/Transferred, Ending Inventory, Total units
    - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / calculate cost per equivalent unit ::@:: Divide _added_ direct materials and _added_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units. <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / calculate cost per equivalent unit / table ::@:: row headers: Cost: Cost to be accounted for: (values: Direct Materials, Conversion, Total), Cost added in this period, Equivalent units (values: ÷ ???; for total, omit), Cost per equivalent unit (values: for total, add the two numbers on the left)
    - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / reconcile costs ::@:: Convert units into costs. <p> Calculate direct materials, conversion, and _total_ separately for 3 things: costs to _complete_ beginning inventory, units _started_ and _transferred_ (hence completed), and _ending_ inventory; using per equivalent unit costs and equivalent (_not_ physical) units. (Actually you should see, combining this step and the previous step, this is just splitting the costs using equivalent units.) <p> The cost of goods transferred is the total cost for everything (including the _starting_ inventory) excluding the _ending_ inventory. Transfer this value to the next process's work in progress inventory or finished goods inventory using a T entry. <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / reconcile costs / table ::@:: row headers: Cost accounted for: (values: Direct Material, Conversion, Total), Cost added to beginning inventory in last period, Cost to complete beginning inventory, Started and completed, Ending inventory, Total costs
    - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / prepare production reports ::@:: The report consists of 3 sections. For each section, the headers are "Section (#) of Production Report", "(company name)", "Process Costing Production Report (FIFO Method)", "(process name) Process", "For (time, e.g. the Quarter Ended March 31, 2025)". <p> Section 1 is merging the tables from step 1 and step 2. Section 2 is the table from step 3. Section 3 is the table from step 4. <p> Formatting: Add dollar signs if needed to the first and last currency number in the same column. Underline total costs in section 3.
  - process costing / weighted average vs. first-in, first-out (FIFO) ::@:: cost, cost flow assumption, units
    - process costing / weighted average vs. first-in, first-out (FIFO) / cost flow assumption ::@:: (former) Unit cost is averaged with both starting inventory and cost of units started during period. <p> (latter) Units in the starting inventory are assumed to be completed before starting any new units.
    - process costing / weighted average vs. first-in, first-out (FIFO) / cost ::@:: (former) Cost from starting inventory and cost of units started during the period are combined. <p> (latter) Cost from starting inventory and cost of units started during the period are separated.
    - process costing / weighted average vs. first-in, first-out (FIFO) / units ::@:: (former) Starting inventory and units started during the period are combined. <p> (latter) Starting inventory and units started during the period are separated.
  - process costing / weighted average
    - process costing / weighted average / advantages ::@:: It is simpler, thus more often used in the real world.
    - process costing / weighted average / disadvantages ::@:: May not be as accurate, especially for companies with significant inventories.
  - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO)
