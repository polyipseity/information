  - job cost / source documents ::@:: documents to assign direct costs to jobs; direct materials: materials requisition form, direct labor: labor time ticket <!--SR:!2025-03-04,17,328!2025-03-04,17,328-->
  - job cost / materials requisition form ::@:: The form should have "Materials Requisition Form", a number (e.g. MR 42), date, job number (e.g. 42), description, a table listing the materials, and an authorized signature. <p> The table should contain a row for each type of materials. The columns are "Material Description" (include numbers or sizes if needed), "Quantity", "Unit Cost", and "Total Cost". Also calculate the "Total Cost" for the entire table for "Total Cost". <!--SR:!2025-03-25,29,288!2025-03-26,30,288-->
  - job cost / (direct) labor time ticket ::@:: The form should have "Direct Labor Time Ticket", dates (e.g. Monday 2/10—Friday 2/14, 2025), ticket number (e.g. TT 42), employee, a table listing the labor, and an authorized signature. <p> The table should contain a row for each consecutive working period.

    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / rationale & handling ::@:: Such costs may be impossible or difficult to trace to particular jobs, consists of many different items, and may not be known until the end of a period. <p> So what we do is identify the cost driver (e.g. direct labor costs, direct labor hours, direct materials costs) and use it as an allocation base. Then use estimates to find the predetermined overhead rate (POHR). This rate is "predetermined" because it is determined before a period begins. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,28,288!2025-03-05,18,328-->
    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / underapplied & overapplied ::@:: The _applied_ manufacturing overhead found using POHR is only an _estimate_. At the end of a period, we can find the _actual_ manufacturing overhead. If applied MOH > actual MOH then it is overapplied, and vice versa. If applied MOH < actual MOH then it is underapplied. <p> This discrepancy is accounted for by adjusting the cost of goods sold (COGS), which will be discussed below. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,18,328!2025-03-05,18,328-->

- topic: process costing
- [process costing](../../../../general/process%20costing.md) ::@:: an accounting methodology that traces and accumulates direct costs, and allocates indirect costs of a manufacturing process <!--SR:!2025-03-08,12,322!2025-03-15,19,342-->
  - process costing / the other costing method ::@:: job costing <!--SR:!2025-03-15,19,342!2025-03-15,19,342-->
  - process costing / use ::@:: For _homogeneous_ products or services produced by standardized processes. <p> Product examples: bottled goods, canned goods, frozen food, paper products, petroleum products, etc. <br/> Service examples: claims and reimbursement process (insurance companies), home finance loans (financial institutions). <!--SR:!2025-03-15,19,342!2025-03-15,19,342-->
  - process costing / overview ::@:: Raw material costs are first added to raw materials inventory. Then when they enter a process, the cost is transferred into the process's "direct materials" account. Conversion costs (direct labor + MOH) are directly added into the process's "conversion cost" account. <p> A unit may require multiple processes. When a unit is transferred from a process to another, we also need to transfer its corresponding cost, so we need to find out per unit cost in a process, which is what process costing does. <!--SR:!2025-03-15,19,342!2025-03-08,12,322-->
  - process costing / data ::@:: In a process, you need to track 4 things: direct materials (account), conversion cost (account), number of units in inventory (including new, WIP, and completed units), and percentage of completion (i.e. how much of units in the inventory are complete). <p> To do costing, first obtain the number for these 4 things at period start and period end. <!--SR:!2025-03-15,19,342!2025-03-08,12,322-->
    - process costing / data / direct materials ::@:: Basically just add the direct materials issued to the process during this period. <!--SR:!2025-03-15,19,342!2025-03-08,12,322-->
    - process costing / data / conversion cost ::@:: Basically just add the conversion cost (direct labor + _applied_ MOH) issued to the process during this period.  The _applied_ MOH can be found by multiplying POHR and the cost driver (usually direct labor hours) assigned to the process. <!--SR:!2025-03-08,12,322!2025-03-15,19,342-->
    - process costing / data / number of units in inventory ::@:: Count the units at period start and at period end. Also record how many unit started for production during this period. Then we can compute how many units have been transferred away (of course, the unit must be completed by the current process for it to be transferred away). <!--SR:!2025-03-15,19,342!2025-03-08,12,322-->
    - process costing / data / percentage of completion ::@:: It is likely given in the question. It only considers units that are in the inventory at period start and period end. <p> For weighted average cost, we do not need the number for period start. <!--SR:!2025-03-15,19,342!2025-03-15,19,342-->
  - process costing / steps ::@:: find physical units (transferred) → convert physical units into equivalent units → calculate cost per equivalent unit → reconcile costs (using per unit cost) → prepare production reports <!--SR:!2025-03-08,12,322!2025-03-15,19,342-->
  - process costing / methods ::@:: first-in, first-out (FIFO), weighted average cost, etc. <!--SR:!2025-03-15,19,342!2025-03-15,19,342-->
  - process costing / equivalent units ::@:: Remember in accounting, costs are only incurred when the performance happens. Since not all physical units in an inventory have been finished, equivalent units account for this by multiplying the completion percentage. <p> Note that it is calculated separately for direct materials (materials may not be all added at the process start) and conversion cost (WIP units). <!--SR:!2025-03-08,12,322!2025-03-15,19,342-->

Physical units in ending inventory are multiplied by the appropriate factors to become equivalent units. <p> For direct materials, multiply by the percentage of required materials added. (This is 100% if all materials have been added at the beginning.) For conversion cost, multiply by the completion percentage of the ending inventory.

    - process costing / weighted average cost / reconcile costs ::@:: Convert units into costs. <p> Calculate direct materials, conversion, and _total_ separately for 2 things: units transferred (hence completed) and _ending_ inventory; using per equivalent unit costs and equivalent (_not_ physical) units. (Actually you should see, combining this step and the previous step, this is just splitting the costs using equivalent units.) <p> The cost of goods transferred is the total cost for everything excluding the _ending_ inventory. Transfer this value to the next process's work in progress inventory or finished goods inventory using a T-entry. <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,10,302!2025-03-08,12,322-->

  - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) ::@:: Essentially, the per unit cost for _newly added_ materials and conversion is calculated by dividing the _added_ direct materials and _added_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units. Units in the _starting_ inventory are assumed to be finished and transferred first, hence FIFO. <!--SR:!2025-03-08,12,322!2025-03-15,19,342-->

## week 3 lecture

- datetime: 2025-02-17T12:00:00+08:00/2025-02-17T13:20:00+08:00
- topic: activity-based costing (ABC)
- [activity-based costing](../../../../general/activity-based%20costing.md) ::@:: It is a costing method that identifies activities in an organization and assigns the cost of each activity to all products and services according to the actual consumption by each. Therefore, this model assigns more indirect costs (overhead) into direct costs compared to conventional costing. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,4,328!2025-02-27,4,328-->
  - activity-based costing / the other costing method ::@:: volume-based costing (includes job costing, process costing) <!--SR:!2025-02-27,4,328!2025-02-27,4,328-->
- volume-based costing
  - volume-based costing / predetermined overhead rate (POHR) ::@:: POHR = estimated MOH / estimated cost driver. We need to identify the cost driver (e.g. direct labor costs, direct labor hours, direct materials costs) and use it as an allocation base. <!--SR:!2025-02-26,3,308!2025-02-27,4,328-->
  - volume-based costing / manufacturing overhead cost per unit ::@:: Find the cost driver assigned to the process producing the units. Then use POHR to find the (applied) manufacturing overhead. Finally divide it by the number of (equivalent) units produced. Less means the process is more efficient. <!--SR:!2025-02-26,3,308!2025-02-27,4,328-->
  - volume-based costing / manufacturing cost per unit ::@:: Simply add the direct materials per unit, direct labor per unit, and (applied) MOH per unit. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,4,328!2025-02-27,4,328-->
  - volume-based costing / gross profit margin ::@:: Find the gross profit per unit by subtracting manufacturing cost per unit from unit selling price. Then divide it by unit selling price and multiply by 100% to get \(_this_\). <!--SR:!2025-02-27,4,328!2025-02-27,4,328-->
- activity-based costing
  - activity-based costing / vs. volume-based costing ::@:: In volume-based costing, indirect costs are applied as applied MOH. POHR is used to find the applied MOH using a cost driver. <p> The problem is that MOH may be caused by multiple cost drivers. Using the same cost driver to estimate the actual MOH using applied MOH may be inaccurate. Activity-based costing assigns indirect costs to products and services based on the activities they require, making the applied MOH more accurate. This means using multiple cost drivers and having multiple POHR. <p> In this sense, activity-based costing _augments_ volume-based costing instead of _replacing_ it. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,4,328!2025-02-26,3,308-->
  - activity-based costing / two-staged allocation ::@:: Assign indirect costs to _activity cost pools_. Then assign the pools to products or services. Note that an activity can be used by multiple products or services, and a product or service can use multiple pools. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,4,328!2025-02-27,4,328-->
  - activity-based costing / activity classification ::@:: (largest to smallest) facility-level, product/service-level, batch-level, unit-level <!--SR:!2025-02-27,4,328!2025-02-27,4,328-->
    - activity-based costing / activity classification / facility-level ::@:: They support the entire company, e.g. company-wide (but not a single product) advertising, human resources, plant (but not a single product line) supervision, etc. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,4,328!2025-02-27,4,328-->
    - activity-based costing / activity classification / product/service-level ::@:: They support a specific product or service, e.g. product advertising, engineering and quality control, product testing, research and development, etc. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,4,328!2025-02-27,4,328-->
    - activity-based costing / activity classification / batch-level ::@:: They support a batch (group of units/group of customers) at once, e.g. machine setup (one setup per batch), ordering materials, shipping a batch, etc. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,4,328!2025-02-27,4,328-->
    - activity-based costing / activity classification / unit-level ::@:: They support a unit or a customer individually, e.g. machining, part installation, product painting, serving a customer, etc. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,4,328!2025-02-27,4,328-->
  - activity-based costing / cost drivers ::@:: The cost drivers we have previously considered before ABC are _volume-based cost drivers_, e.g. direct materials, direct labor, machining hours, units produced, etc. In ABC, we also consider _non-volume-based cost drivers_, e.g. batch count, design count, processing time per unit, quality inspections, setup time, etc. <p> For each activity cost pool, we choose a cost driver that has a causal relationship with the activity, which should be non-volume-based cost drivers. <!--SR:!2025-02-26,3,308!2025-02-26,3,308-->
    - activity-based costing / cost drivers / advantages ::@:: By also considering non-volume-based cost drivers, it can assign indirect costs to products or services more accurately, especially those that require more indirect costs. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,4,328!2025-02-27,4,328-->
