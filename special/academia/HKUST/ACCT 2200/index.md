- topic: job order costing
- [job costing](../../../../general/job%20costing.md) ::@:: accounting which tracks the costs and revenues by "job" and enables standardized reporting of profitability by job
  - job costing / the other costing method ::@:: process costing
  - job costing / vs. process costing ::@:: approach, cost accumulation, product type, report types
    - job costing / vs. process costing / approach ::@:: customized to the needs of clients or customers; mass produced using standardized processes
    - job costing / vs. process costing / cost accumulation ::@:: accumulates per customer/project/job; accumulates per process
    - job costing / vs. process costing / product type ::@:: unique products and services (e.g. construction projects); homogeneous products and services (e.g. soft drinks)
    - job costing / vs. process costing / report types ::@:: job cost sheet per customer/project/job; production report per process
  - job cost / manufacturing costs ::@:: direct materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead; add them together
  - job cost / source documents ::@:: documents to assign direct costs to jobs; direct materials: materials requisition form, direct labor: labor time ticket
  - job cost / materials requisition form ::@:: The form should have "Materials Requisition Form", a number (e.g. MR 42), date, job number (e.g. 42), description, a table listing the materials, and an authorized signature. <p> The table should contain a row for each type of materials. The columns are "Material Description" (include numbers or sizes if needed), "Quantity", "Unit Cost", and "Total Cost". Also calculate the "Total Cost" for the entire table for "Total Cost".
  - job cost / (direct) labor time ticket ::@:: The form should have "Direct Labor Time Ticket", dates (e.g. Monday 2/10—Friday 2/14, 2025), ticket number (e.g. TT 42), employee, a table listing the labor, and an authorized signature. <p> The table should contain a row for each consecutive working period. The columns are "Date", "Time Started", "Time Ended", "Total Hours", "Hourly Rate', "Total Amount", and "Job Number" (cell values may be text, e.g. "Training"). Also calculate the "Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Whatever Total" for the entire table for "Total Hours" and "Total Amount".
  - job cost / job cost sheet ::@:: The form should have "Job Cost Sheet", job number (e.g. 42), date started, date completed, description, 3 tables in the middle (resp. with the header "Actual Direct Materials", "Actual Direct Labor", "Applied Manufacturing Overhead"), and a bottom section with the header "Cost Summary". <p> For the table "Actual Direct Materials", the columns are "Req. No" and "Amount". For the table "Actual Direct Labor", the columns are "Ticket", "Hours", and "Amount". For the table "Applied Manufacturing Overhead", the columns are (unit for primary cost driver, e.g. "Hours" for label) and "Amount". <p> For the section "Cost Summary", write the 3 numbers above vertically and label them, and then calculate the "Total Cost" for this job.
  - job cost / [manufacturing overhead](../../../../general/factory%20overhead.md) (MOH) ::@:: Applied Manufacturing Overhead = Predetermined Overhead Rate (POHR) × Actual Cost Driver <p> The actual cost driver/allocation base may be direct labor costs (less common), direct labor hours (more common), direct materials costs, etc.
    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / rationale & handling ::@:: Such costs may be impossible or difficult to trace to particular jobs, consists of many different items, and may not be known until the end of a period. <p> So what we do is identify the cost driver (e.g. direct labor costs, direct labor hours, direct materials costs) and use it as an allocation base. Then use estimates to find the predetermined overhead rate (POHR). This rate is "predetermined" because it is determined before a period begins.
    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / underapplied & overapplied ::@:: The _applied_ manufacturing overhead found using POHR is only an _estimate_. At the end of a period, we can find the _actual_ manufacturing overhead. If applied MOH > actual MOH then it is overapplied, and vice versa. If applied MOH < actual MOH then it is underapplied. <p> This discrepancy is accounted for by adjusting the cost of goods sold (COGS), which will be discussed below.

- datetime: 2025-02-12T12:00:00+08:00/2025-02-12T13:20:00+08:00
- topic: process costing
- [process costing](../../../../general/process%20costing.md) ::@:: an accounting methodology that traces and accumulates direct costs, and allocates indirect costs of a manufacturing process
  - process costing / the other costing method ::@:: job costing
  - process costing / use ::@:: For _homogeneous_ products or services produced by standardized processes. <p> Product examples: bottled goods, canned goods, frozen food, paper products, petroleum products, etc. <br/> Service examples: claims and reimbursement process (insurance companies), home finance loans (financial institutions), etc.
  - process costing / overview ::@:: Raw material costs are first added to raw materials inventory. Then when they enter a process, the cost is transferred into the process's "direct materials" account. Conversion costs (direct labor + MOH) are directly added into the process's "conversion cost" account. <p> A unit may require multiple processes. When a unit is transferred from a process to another, we also need to transfer its corresponding cost, so we need to find out per unit cost in a process, which is what process costing does.
  - process costing / data ::@:: In a process, you need to track 4 things: direct materials (account), conversion cost (account), number of units in inventory (including new, WIP, and completed units), and percentage of completion (i.e. how much of units in the inventory are complete). <p> To do costing, first obtain the number for these 4 things at period start and period end.
    - process costing / data / direct materials ::@:: Basically just add the direct materials issued to the process during this period.
    - process costing / data / conversion cost ::@:: Basically just add the conversion cost (direct labor + _applied_ MOH) issued to the process during this period. The _applied_ MOH can be found by multiplying POHR and the cost driver (usually direct labor hours) assigned to the process.
    - process costing / data / number of units in inventory ::@:: Count the units at period start and at period end. Also record how many unit started for production during this period. Then we can compute how many units have been transferred away (of course, the unit must be completed by the current process for it to be transferred away).
    - process costing / data / percentage of completion ::@:: It is likely given in the question. It only considers units that are in the inventory at period start and period end. <p> For weighted average cost, we do not need the number for period start.
  - process costing / steps ::@:: find physical units (transferred) → convert physical units into equivalent units → calculate cost per equivalent unit → reconcile costs (using per unit cost) → prepare production reports
  - process costing / methods ::@:: first-in, first-out (FIFO), weighted average cost, etc.
  - process costing / equivalent units ::@:: Remember in accounting, costs are only incurred when the performance happens. Since not all physical units in an inventory have been finished, equivalent units account for this by multiplying the completion percentage. <p> Note that it is calculated separately for direct materials (materials may not be all added at the process start) and conversion cost (WIP units).
  - process costing / weighted average cost ::@:: Essentially, the per unit cost is calculated by dividing the _ending_ direct materials and _ending_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units.
    - process costing / weighted average cost / find physical units ::@:: Compute units transferred (which must be completed for them to be transferred in the first place). <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / weighted average cost / find physical units / table ::@:: row headers: Units (values: Physical Units), Units to be accounted for:, Beginning Inventory, Started this period, Total units
    - process costing / weighted average cost / convert physical units into equivalent units ::@:: Calculate equivalent units separately for direct materials and conversion cost. <p> Transferred (hence completed) physical units become equivalent units one-to-one (factor of 100%). Physical units in ending inventory are multiplied by the appropriate factors to become equivalent units. <p> For direct materials, multiply by the percentage of required materials added. (This is 100% if all materials have been added at the beginning.) For conversion cost, multiply by the completion percentage of the ending inventory. (This number is usually given.) <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / weighted average cost / convert physical units into equivalent units / table ::@:: row headers: Units accounted for: (values: Physical Units, Direct Materials, Conversion), Completed/Transferred, Ending Inventory, Total units
    - process costing / weighted average cost / calculate cost per equivalent unit ::@:: Divide _ending_ direct materials and _ending_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units. <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / weighted average cost / calculate cost per equivalent unit / table ::@:: row headers: Cost: Cost to be accounted for: (values: Direct Materials, Conversion, Total), Beginning inventory, Cost added in this period, Total cost, Equivalent units (values: ÷ ???; for total, omit), Cost per equivalent unit (values: for total, add the two numbers on the left)
    - process costing / weighted average cost / reconcile costs ::@:: Convert units into costs. <p> Calculate direct materials, conversion, and _total_ separately for 2 things: units transferred (hence completed) and _ending_ inventory; using per equivalent unit costs and equivalent (_not_ physical) units. (Actually you should see, combining this step and the previous step, this is just splitting the costs using equivalent units.) <p> The cost of goods transferred is the total cost for everything excluding the _ending_ inventory. Transfer this value to the next process's work in progress inventory or finished goods inventory using a T-entry. <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / weighted average cost / reconcile costs / table ::@:: row headers: Cost accounted for: (values: Direct Material, Conversion, Total), Cost of units completed, Ending inventory, Total costs
    - process costing / weighted average cost / prepare production reports ::@:: The report consists of 3 sections. For each section, the headers are "Section (#) of Production Report", "(company name)", "Process Costing Production Report (Weighted Average Method)", "(process name) Process", "For (time, e.g. the Quarter Ended March 31, 2025)". <p> Section 1 is merging the tables from step 1 and step 2. Section 2 is the table from step 3. Section 3 is the table from step 4. <p> Formatting: Add dollar signs if needed to the first and last currency number in the same column. Underline total costs in section 3.
  - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) ::@:: Essentially, the per unit cost for _newly added_ materials and _newly added_ conversion is calculated by dividing the _added_ direct materials and _added_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units. Units in the _starting_ inventory are assumed to be finished and transferred first, hence FIFO.
    - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / find physical units ::@:: Compute units transferred (which must be completed for them to be transferred in the first place). Then compute units that are started (_not_ in the _starting_ inventory) and transferred during this period. Using FIFO, we assume units in the _starting_ inventory are completed first. <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / find physical units / table ::@:: row headers: Units (values: Physical Units), Units to be accounted for:, Beginning Inventory, Started this period, Total units
    - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / convert physical units into equivalent units ::@:: Calculate equivalent units separately for direct materials and conversion cost. <p> Physical units in starting inventory _completed_ and transferred first. Multiply by the appropriate factors to become equivalent units. For direct materials, multiply by the percentage of _remaining_ required materials. (This is 0% if all materials have been added at the beginning). For conversion cost, multiply by the _remaining_ completion percentage. (The completion percentage is usually given, but you need to 100% − _x_ the number to get the _remaining_ completion percentage.) <p> Transferred (hence completed) physical units that are _started_ in this period become equivalent units one-to-one (factor of 100%). <p> Physical units in ending inventory are multiplied by the appropriate factors to become equivalent units. For direct materials, multiply by the percentage of required materials added. (This is 100% if all materials have been added at the beginning.) For conversion cost, multiply by the completion percentage of the ending inventory. (This number is usually given.) <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / convert physical units into equivalent units / table ::@:: row headers: Units accounted for: (values: Physical Units, Direct Materials, Conversion), Beginning Work in Progress, Completed/Transferred, Ending Inventory, Total units
    - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / calculate cost per equivalent unit ::@:: Divide _added_ direct materials and _added_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units. <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / calculate cost per equivalent unit / table ::@:: row headers: Cost: Cost to be accounted for: (values: Direct Materials, Conversion, Total), Cost added in this period, Equivalent units (values: ÷ ???; for total, omit), Cost per equivalent unit (values: for total, add the two numbers on the left)
    - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / reconcile costs ::@:: Convert units into costs. <p> Calculate direct materials, conversion, and _total_ separately for 3 things: costs to _complete_ beginning inventory, units _started_ and _transferred_ (hence completed), and _ending_ inventory; using per equivalent unit costs and equivalent (_not_ physical) units. (Actually you should see, combining this step and the previous step, this is just splitting the costs using equivalent units.) <p> The cost of goods transferred is the total cost for everything (including the _starting_ inventory) excluding the _ending_ inventory. Transfer this value to the next process's work in progress inventory or finished goods inventory using a T-entry. <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values.
      - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / reconcile costs / table ::@:: row headers: Cost accounted for: (values: Direct Material, Conversion, Total), Cost added to beginning inventory in last period, Cost to complete beginning inventory, Started and completed, Ending inventory, Total costs
    - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO) / prepare production reports ::@:: The report consists of 3 sections. For each section, the headers are "Section (#) of Production Report", "(company name)", "Process Costing Production Report (FIFO Method)", "(process name) Process", "For (time, e.g. the Quarter Ended March 31, 2025)". <p> Section 1 is merging the tables from step 1 and step 2. Section 2 is the table from step 3. Section 3 is the table from step 4. <p> Formatting: Add dollar signs if needed to the first and last currency number in the same column. Underline total costs in section 3.
  - process costing / weighted average vs. first-in, first-out (FIFO) ::@:: cost, cost flow assumption, units
    - process costing / weighted average vs. first-in, first-out (FIFO) / cost flow assumption ::@:: (former) Unit cost is averaged with both starting inventory and cost of units started during period. <p> (latter) Units in the starting inventory are assumed to be completed before starting any new units.
    - process costing / weighted average vs. first-in, first-out (FIFO) / cost ::@:: (former) Cost from starting inventory and cost of units started during the period are combined. <p> (latter) Cost from starting inventory and cost of units started during the period are separated.
    - process costing / weighted average vs. first-in, first-out (FIFO) / units ::@:: (former) Starting inventory and units started during the period are combined. <p> (latter) Starting inventory and units started during the period are separated.
  - process costing / weighted average
    - process costing / weighted average / advantages ::@:: It is simpler, thus more often used in the real world.
    - process costing / weighted average / disadvantages ::@:: May not be as accurate, especially for companies with significant inventories.
  - process costing / first-in, first-out (FIFO)

- topic: activity-based costing (ABC)
- [activity-based costing](../../../../general/activity-based%20costing.md) ::@:: It is a costing method that identifies activities in an organization and assigns the cost of each activity to all products and services according to the actual consumption by each. Therefore, this model assigns more indirect costs (overhead) into direct costs compared to conventional costing.
  - activity-based costing / the other costing method ::@:: volume-based costing (includes job costing, process costing)
- volume-based costing
  - volume-based costing / predetermined overhead rate (POHR) ::@:: POHR = estimated MOH / estimated cost driver. We need to identify the cost driver (e.g. direct labor costs, direct labor hours, direct materials costs) and use it as an allocation base.
  - volume-based costing / manufacturing overhead cost per unit ::@:: Find the cost driver assigned to the process producing the units. Then use POHR to find the (applied) manufacturing overhead. Finally divide it by the number of (equivalent) units produced. Less means the process is more efficient.
  - volume-based costing / manufacturing cost per unit ::@:: Simply add the direct materials per unit, direct labor per unit, and (applied) MOH per unit.
  - volume-based costing / gross profit margin ::@:: Find the gross profit per unit by subtracting manufacturing cost per unit from unit selling price. Then divide it by unit selling price and multiply by 100% to get \(_this_\).
- activity-based costing
  - activity-based costing / vs. volume-based costing ::@:: In volume-based costing, indirect costs are applied as applied MOH. POHR is used to find the applied MOH using a cost driver. <p> The problem is that MOH may be caused by multiple cost drivers. Using the same cost driver to estimate the actual MOH using applied MOH may be inaccurate. Activity-based costing assigns indirect costs to products and services based on the activities they require, making the applied MOH more accurate. This means using multiple cost drivers and having multiple POHR. <p> In this sense, activity-based costing _augments_ volume-based costing instead of _replacing_ it.
  - activity-based costing / two-staged allocation ::@:: Assign indirect costs to _activity cost pools_ (the costs over all pools _should_ sum up to the indirect costs). Then assign the pools to products or services. Note that an activity can be used by multiple products or services, and a product or service can use multiple pools.
  - activity-based costing / activity classification ::@:: (largest to smallest) facility-level, product/service-level, batch-level, unit-level
    - activity-based costing / activity classification / facility-level ::@:: They support the entire company, e.g. company-wide (but not a single product) advertising, human resources, plant (but not a single product line) supervision, etc.
    - activity-based costing / activity classification / product/service-level ::@:: They support a specific product or service, e.g. product advertising, engineering and quality control, product testing, research and development, etc.
    - activity-based costing / activity classification / batch-level ::@:: They support a batch (group of units/group of customers) at once, e.g. machine setup (one setup per batch), ordering materials, shipping a batch, etc.
    - activity-based costing / activity classification / unit-level ::@:: They support a unit or a customer individually, e.g. machining, part installation, product painting, serving a customer, etc.
  - activity-based costing / cost drivers ::@:: The cost drivers we have previously considered before ABC are _volume-based cost drivers_, e.g. direct materials, direct labor, machining hours, units produced, etc. In ABC, we also consider _non-volume-based cost drivers_, e.g. batch count, design count, processing time per unit, quality inspections, setup time, etc. <p> For each activity cost pool, we choose a cost driver that has a causal relationship with the activity, which should be non-volume-based cost drivers.
    - activity-based costing / cost drivers / advantages ::@:: By also considering non-volume-based cost drivers, it can assign indirect costs to products or services more accurately, especially those that require more indirect costs.

- topic: activity-based costing (ABC)
- activity-based costing
  - activity-based costing / activity-rate method ::@:: For each activity cost pool, choose a cost driver. Calculate the activity rate using: <p> activity rate = total activity cost / total cost driver <p> You may use a _table_ to calculate the total cost driver. You may also use a _table_ to allocate the costs to different processes/products/services.
    - activity-based costing / activity-rate method / table (total cost driver) ::@:: column headers: activity cost pool, total activity cost, (processes...), _total_ activity
    - activity-based costing / activity-rate method / table (total cost driver: number of setups) ::@:: row headers: total number of units produced, average units per batch, number of setups <br/> column headers: activity cost pool, (processes...), _total_ (number)
    - activity-based costing / activity-rate method / table (cost allocation) ::@:: row headers: (activity pool), activity rate, _total_ costs <br/> column headers: activity cost pool, (processes...), _total_ costs
  - activity-based costing / total manufacturing overhead ::@:: Add up all manufacturing overheads obtained using activity-based costing. This calculated MOH is _applied_ or _actual_ depending on how the original activity rate was calculated (usually _applied_). <p> You may use a _table_.
    - activity-based costing / total manufacturing overhead / table ::@:: row headers: activity cost pool, (processes...), _total_ costs <br/> column headers: (pools...), _total_ manufacturing overhead cost
  - activity-based costing / manufacturing overhead cost per unit ::@:: For each process/product/service, simply divide total manufacturing overhead by number of (equivalent) units produced. <p> You may use a _table_.
  - activity-based costing / manufacturing cost per unit ::@:: Simply add the direct materials per unit, direct labor per unit, and (applied) MOH per unit. <p> Actually same as that in volume-based activity. <p> You may use a _table_.
  - activity-based costing / gross profit margin ::@:: Find the gross profit per unit by subtracting manufacturing cost per unit from unit selling price. Then divide it by unit selling price and multiply by 100% to get \(_this_\). <p> Actually same as that in volume-based activity. <p> You may use a _table_.
- [activity-based management](../../../../general/activity-based%20management.md) (ABM) ::@:: It includes actions taken to improve operations or reduce costs using ABC. The first step is identifying areas to improve, e.g. activities, cost, value-added, etc.
  - activity-based management / example ::@:: Instead of looking at processes/jobs to improve, we look at the activities that processes/jobs require across all processes/jobs. <p> Using ABC, then we can find high-cost activities, and improve on them. We can also identify _value-added_ costs (e.g. designing, machining) and _non-value-added_ costs (e.g. advertising, billing, inspection, meeting, transportation).
- price setting ::@:: markup, target costing, etc.
- [markup](../../../../general/markup%20(business)) ::@:: sale price = cost × (1 + markup) <p> It uses the cost and markup percentage to set the price. It ignores the market _supply and demand_.
- [target costing](../../../../general/target%20costing.md) ::@:: It is an approach to determine a product's _life-cycle cost_ which should be sufficient to develop specified functionality and quality, while _ensuring_ its desired profit. <p> It differs from markup in that we use the market price (target price) and target profit to set the cost instead of the other way around. This way, market _supply and demand_ is considered.
  - target costing / equation ::@:: The target profit % (margin) is used to calculate the target profit from the target price. Then use the following equation: <p> target price – target profit = target cost <p> And then the target cost is the maximum amount spendable for lifecycle cost while ensuring a XX% profit/return.

- topic: cost behavior
- cost behavior ::@:: It describes how total cost changes when activity changes.
  - cost behavior / assumptions ::@:: We assume _unit variable costs_ and _total fixed costs_ both remain _unchanged_. The range of activity for which these holds is called the _relevant range_. There can be multiple relevant ranges.
- variable cost
  - variable cost / cost behavior ::@:: Assume we are within the _relevant range_. Total cost of this type is proportional to activity. Per unit cost of this type is constant with regards to activity.
- fixed cost
  - fixed cost / cost behavior ::@:: Assume we are within the _relevant range_. Total cost of this type is constant with regards to activity. Per unit cost of this type is inversely proportional to activity.
- mixed cost ::@:: fixed cost + variable cost, e.g. a cell phone plan with monthly charge plus usage charge
- cost behavior
  - cost behavior / linear equation ::@:: $$y = a + bx \,,$$ where $y$ is the total cost, $a$ is the _total_ fixed cost, $b$ is the _unit_ variable cost, $x$ is activity/cost driver.
  - cost behavior / graph ::@:: $y$ is plotted on the vertical axis, called the _dependent variable_. $x$ is plotted on the horizontal axis, called the _independent variable_.
- [scatter plot](../../../../general/scatter%20plot.md) (scattergraph) ::@:: a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data
- cost behavior
  - cost behavior / linear regression ::@:: scattergraph, high—low method, least squares
    - cost behavior / linear regression / scattergraph ::@:: Graph the total cost $y$ against activity $x$ on a scatter plot. Then just intuitively draw a line through the points.
    - cost behavior / linear regression / high—low method ::@:: Find two data points: one with min $x$, the other with max $x$. Find the slope $b$ (unit variable cost) of the line connecting them. This will be $b$. Then find the y-intercept $a$ (fixed cost) on the line connecting them.
    - cost behavior / linear regression / least squares ::@:: Minimize the sum of squared $y$ errors with the fitted line. Software, e.g. Excel, can be used to find the line. The intercept $a$ and the slope $b$ means the same thing as the other methods.
      - [least squares](../../../../general/least%20squares.md) ::@:: a parameter estimation method based on minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals (a residual being the difference between an observed value and the fitted value provided by a model) made in the results of each individual equation
      - cost behavior / linear regression / least squares / outputs ::@:: R square \(R<sup>2</sup>\): how closely the relation is explained by the fitted line <br/> intercept: estimated total fixed costs <br/> $x$ coefficient/slope: estimated unit variable costs
      - cost behavior / linear regression / least squares / significance ::@:: significance F, p-value (for the $x$ coefficient/slope): They are the same when one independent variable is used to predict one dependent variable. Compare them with the significance level: The value being lower than the significance level means the result is significant (useful).
    - cost behavior / linear regression / advantages ::@:: scattergraph, high—low method: intuitive, simple <br/> least squares: easy using Excel, uses all data points
    - cost behavior / linear regression / disadvantages ::@:: scattergraph: inexact, subjective <br/> high—low method: uses only two data points at the extreme but not at the middle <br/> least squares: requires proper interpretation, uses more assumptions and data
- [contribution margin](../../../../general/contribution%20margin.md) ::@:: the selling price per unit minus the variable cost per unit <p> (alternative, in this course: sales revenue minus variable costs)
  - contribution margin / ratio ::@:: contribution margin per unit / selling price per unit <p> (alternative, in this course: contribution margin / sales revenue)
  - contribution margin / increased ::@:: It can also be used to account for increased sales. <p> You may use a _table_: increased sales; less: increased variable costs; increased contribution margin; less: increased fixed costs; (total:) increased net operating income
- [variable costing](../../../../general/variable%20costing.md) ::@:: Under this method, manufacturing overhead is incurred in the period that a product is produced. This addresses the issue of absorption costing that allows income to rise as production rises. <p> Variable costing is generally not used for external reporting purposes. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, income statements must use absorption costing to comply with GAAP.
  - variable costing / purpose ::@:: cost accounting for internal decision making
  - variable costing / cost classification ::@:: costs are mainly split into fixed costs, variable costs
  - variable costing / manufacturing overhead ::@:: incurred in the period that a product is produced
  - variable costing / formula ::@:: (net) sales, less: variable costs, (subtotal:) _contribution margin_, less: fixed costs, (total:) net operating income
- [total absorption costing](../../../../general/total%20absorption%20costing.md) ::@:: Under an absorption cost method, management can push forward costs to the next period when products are sold. This artificially inflates profits in the period of production by incurring less cost than would be incurred under a variable costing system. <p> Variable costing is generally not used for external reporting purposes. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, income statements must use absorption costing to comply with GAAP.
  - total absorption costing / purpose ::@:: cost accounting for external financial reporting (GAAP)
  - total absorption costing / cost classification ::@:: costs are mainly split into manufacturing costs, non-manufacturing costs
  - total absorption costing / manufacturing overhead ::@:: divided between cost of goods sold (when overapplied, underapplied, or sold) and ending inventory (when unsold)
  - total absorption / formula ::@:: (net) sales, less: cost of goods sold, (subtotal:) _gross margin_, less: non-manufacturing expenses, (total:) net operating income
- variable costing
  - variable costing / from total absorption costing ::@:: Move all variable costs in manufacturing (e.g. variable manufacturing costs) _and_ non-manufacturing overhead (e.g. variable selling expenses) to variable costs. The variable costs should be based on units _sold_, not _manufactured_. <p> Move all fixed costs in manufacturing (e.g. manufacturing overhead) _and_ non-manufacturing overhead (e.g. general and administrative expenses). _Importantly_, _all_ manufacturing overhead incurred (instead of the portion corresponding to sold goods) during the period is expensed.
  - variable costing / vs. total absorption costing ::@:: In the former, manufacturing overhead is expensed in the period the goods are produced. In the latter, manufacturing overhead is expensed in the period the goods are sold. <p> So the calculated net operating income differs.
    - variable costing / vs. total absorption costing / net operating income (NOP) ::@:: absorption NOP – variable NOP = change in ending inventory × manufacturing overhead per unit <p> Intuitively, changes in ending inventory reflect imbalance between production and sales. When production > sales, inventory increases and absorption NOP > variable NOP. When production < sales, inventory decreases and absorption NOP < variable NOP.

- [cost–volume–profit analysis](../../../../general/cost–volume–profit%20analysis.md) ::@:: It is a form of cost accounting. It is a simplified model, useful for elementary instruction and for short-run decisions.
- [break-even point](../../../../general/break-even%20point.md) ::@:: It is the point at which total cost and total revenue are equal, i.e. "even".
- cost–volume–profit analysis
  - cost–volume–profit analysis / method ::@:: contribution margin ratio method, profit equation method, unit contribution margin method
  - cost–volume–profit analysis / profit equation method ::@:: Write profit (net operating income) as a function of quantity. Equate it to _0_ and solve for quantity.
    - cost–volume–profit analysis / profit equation method / equation ::@:: unit price × quantity − unit variable costs × quantity - fixed costs
    - cost–volume–profit analysis / profit equation method / target profit ::@:: Write profit (net operating income) as a function of quantity. Equate it to the _target profit_ and solve for quantity.
  - cost–volume–profit analysis / graph ::@:: The graph shows both profit method and contribution method: ![cost–volume–profit analysis graph](../../../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/CVP-TC-FC-VC-Sales-Contrib-VC-PL-compat.svg)
  - cost–volume–profit analysis / unit contribution margin method ::@:: Find the _unit_ contribution margin. Then find _break-even units_ by dividing _fixed_ costs by unit contribution margin. Then find _break-even sales_ by multiplying break-even units by selling price. <p> You may use a _table_. (But really, is it necessary?)
    - cost–volume–profit analysis / unit contribution margin method / target profit ::@:: Find the _unit_ contribution margin. Then find _target units_ by adding fixed costs _and_ target profit, and then dividing it by unit contribution margin. Then find _target sales_ by multiplying target units by selling price.
  - cost–volume–profit analysis / contribution margin ratio method ::@:: Find the contribution margin _ratio_. Then find _break-even sales_ by dividing _fixed_ costs by contribution margin ratio. <p> You may use a _table_. (But really, is it necessary?)
    - cost–volume–profit analysis / contribution margin ratio method / target sales ::@:: Find the contribution margin _ratio_. Then find _target sales_ by adding fixed costs _and_ target profit, and then dividing it by contribution margin ratio.
  - cost–volume–profit analysis / assumptions::@:: classification, factors, linearity, product mix, production
    - cost–volume–profit analysis / assumptions / linearity ::@:: The behavior of both costs and revenues is linear throughout the _relevant range_ of activity. <p> For example, volume discounts on purchases or sales are precluded.
    - cost–volume–profit analysis / assumptions / classification ::@:: Costs can be classified accurately as either fixed or variable.
    - cost–volume–profit analysis / assumptions / factors ::@:: Changes in activity/volume are the only factors that affect costs. <p> For example, learning curves, productivity gains, and volume discounts are precluded.
    - cost–volume–profit analysis / assumptions / production ::@:: All units produced are sold (there is no ending finished goods inventory). <p> This simplification is because some costs vary with production while others vary with sales. No ending inventory change also means the net operating income/profit is the same between total absorption costing and variable costing.
    - cost–volume–profit analysis / assumptions / product mix ::@:: When a company sells more than one type of product, the product mix (the ratio of each product to total sales) will remain constant.
  - cost–volume–profit analysis / margin of safety ::@:: It is the difference between actual/budgeted (net) sales and break-even point: <p> actual/budgeted (net) sales − break-even point <p> It represents the strength of the business.
