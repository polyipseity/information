    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / rationale & handling ::@:: Such costs may be impossible or difficult to trace to particular jobs, consists of many different items, and may not be known until the end of a period. <p> So what we do is identify the cost driver (e.g. direct labor costs, direct labor hours, direct materials costs) and use it as an allocation base. Then use estimates to find the predetermined overhead rate (POHR). This rate is "predetermined" because it is determined before a period begins. <!--SR:!2025-06-16,84,288!2025-05-05,61,328-->
    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / underapplied & overapplied ::@:: The _applied_ manufacturing overhead found using POHR is only an _estimate_. At the end of a period, we can find the _actual_ manufacturing overhead. If applied MOH > actual MOH then it is overapplied, and vice versa. If applied MOH < actual MOH then it is underapplied. <p> This discrepancy is accounted for by adjusting the cost of goods sold (COGS), which will be discussed below. <!--SR:!2025-05-05,61,328!2025-05-05,61,328-->

- topic: process costing
- [process costing](../../../../general/process%20costing.md) ::@:: an accounting methodology that traces and accumulates direct costs, and allocates indirect costs of a manufacturing process <!--SR:!2025-04-29,52,342!2025-06-15,92,362-->
  - process costing / the other costing method ::@:: job costing <!--SR:!2025-06-14,91,362!2025-06-15,92,362-->
  - process costing / use ::@:: For _homogeneous_ products or services produced by standardized processes. <p> Product examples: bottled goods, canned goods, frozen food, paper products, petroleum products, etc. <br/> Service examples: claims and reimbursement process (insurance companies), home finance loans (financial institutions), etc. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,67,342!2025-06-12,89,362-->
  - process costing / overview ::@:: Raw material costs are first added to raw materials inventory. Then when they enter a process, the cost is transferred into the process's "direct materials" account. Conversion costs (direct labor + MOH) are directly added into the process's "conversion cost" account. <p> A unit may require multiple processes. When a unit is transferred from a process to another, we also need to transfer its corresponding cost, so we need to find out per unit cost in a process, which is what process costing does. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,67,342!2025-04-28,51,342-->
  - process costing / data ::@:: In a process, you need to track 4 things: direct materials (account), conversion cost (account), number of units in inventory (including new, WIP, and completed units), and percentage of completion (i.e. how much of units in the inventory are complete). <p> To do costing, first obtain the number for these 4 things at period start and period end. <!--SR:!2025-06-12,89,362!2025-04-29,52,342-->
    - process costing / data / direct materials ::@:: Basically just add the direct materials issued to the process during this period. <!--SR:!2025-06-13,90,362!2025-04-29,52,342-->
    - process costing / data / conversion cost ::@:: Basically just add the conversion cost (direct labor + _applied_ MOH) issued to the process during this period.  The _applied_ MOH can be found by multiplying POHR and the cost driver (usually direct labor hours) assigned to the process. <!--SR:!2025-04-15,38,322!2025-05-22,68,342-->
    - process costing / data / number of units in inventory ::@:: Count the units at period start and at period end. Also record how many unit started for production during this period. Then we can compute how many units have been transferred away (of course, the unit must be completed by the current process for it to be transferred away). <!--SR:!2025-05-22,68,342!2025-04-28,51,342-->
    - process costing / data / percentage of completion ::@:: It is likely given in the question. It only considers units that are in the inventory at period start and period end. <p> For weighted average cost, we do not need the number for period start. <!--SR:!2025-06-15,92,362!2025-06-15,92,362-->
  - process costing / steps ::@:: find physical units (transferred) โ convert physical units into equivalent units โ calculate cost per equivalent unit โ reconcile costs (using per unit cost) โ prepare production reports <!--SR:!2025-04-29,52,342!2025-06-10,87,362-->
  - process costing / methods ::@:: first-in, first-out (FIFO), weighted average cost, etc. <!--SR:!2025-06-15,92,362!2025-06-13,90,362-->
  - process costing / equivalent units ::@:: Remember in accounting, costs are only incurred when the performance happens. Since not all physical units in an inventory have been finished, equivalent units account for this by multiplying the completion percentage. <p> Note that it is calculated separately for direct materials (materials may not be all added at the process start) and conversion cost (WIP units). <!--SR:!2025-04-15,38,322!2025-06-15,92,362-->
    - process costing / equivalent units / different methods ::@:: weighted average cost method: The equivalent units include those in the starting inventory. <br/> first-in, first-out \(FIFO\) method: The equivalent units do _not_ include those in the starting inventory. <!--SR:!2025-04-14,24,381!2025-04-14,24,381-->
  - process costing / weighted average cost ::@:: Essentially, the per unit cost is calculated by dividing the _ending_ direct materials and _ending_ conversion cost by their respective equivalent units. <!--SR:!2025-05-22,68,342!2025-04-29,52,342-->
    - process costing / weighted average cost / find physical units ::@:: Compute units transferred (which must be completed for them to be transferred in the first place). <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values. <!--SR:!2025-05-22,68,342!2025-04-29,52,342-->
      - process costing / weighted average cost / find physical units / table: [formats ยง process costing \(weighted average\)](formats.md#process%20costing%20(weighted%20average))
    - process costing / weighted average cost / convert physical units into equivalent units ::@:: Calculate equivalent units separately for direct materials and conversion cost. <p> Transferred (hence completed) physical units become equivalent units one-to-one (factor of 100%). Physical units in ending inventory are multiplied by the appropriate factors to become equivalent units. <p> For direct materials, multiply by the percentage of required materials added. (This is 100% if all materials have been added at the beginning.) For conversion cost, multiply by the completion percentage of the ending inventory. (This number is usually given.) <p> You may use a _table_ to compute the values. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,31,302!2025-05-22,68,342-->

Multiply by the appropriate factors to become equivalent units. For direct materials, multiply by the percentage of _remaining_ required materials. (This is 0% if all materials have been added at the beginning). For conversion cost, multiply by the _remaining_ completion percentage. (The completion percentage is usually given, but you need to 100% โ _x_ the number to get the _remaining_ completion percentage.) <p> Transferred (hence completed) physical units that are _started_ in this period become equivalent units one-to-one (factor of 100%). <p> Physical units in ending inventory are multiplied by the appropriate factors to become equivalent units.

- topic: activity-based costing (ABC)
- [activity-based costing](../../../../general/activity-based%20costing.md) ::@:: It is a costing method that identifies activities in an organization and assigns the cost of each activity to all products and services according to the actual consumption by each. Therefore, this model assigns more indirect costs (overhead) into direct costs compared to conventional costing. <!--SR:!2025-06-14,88,368!2025-05-16,61,348-->
  - activity-based costing / the other costing method ::@:: volume-based costing (includes job costing, process costing) <!--SR:!2025-06-18,92,368!2025-06-18,92,368-->
- volume-based costing
  - volume-based costing / predetermined overhead rate (POHR) ::@:: POHR = estimated MOH / estimated cost driver. We need to identify the cost driver (e.g. direct labor costs, direct labor hours, direct materials costs) and use it as an allocation base. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,35,328!2025-05-23,66,348-->
  - volume-based costing / manufacturing overhead cost per unit ::@:: Find the cost driver assigned to the process producing the units. Then use POHR to find the (applied) manufacturing overhead. Finally divide it by the number of (equivalent) units produced. Less means the process is more efficient. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,35,328!2025-05-15,60,348-->
  - volume-based costing / manufacturing cost per unit ::@:: Simply add the direct materials per unit, direct labor per unit, and (applied) MOH per unit. <!--SR:!2025-06-12,86,368!2025-06-14,88,368-->

- topic: activity-based costing (ABC)
- activity-based costing
  - activity-based costing / vs. volume-based costing ::@:: In volume-based costing, indirect costs are applied as applied MOH. POHR is used to find the applied MOH using a cost driver. <p> The problem is that MOH may be caused by multiple cost drivers. Using the same cost driver to estimate the actual MOH using applied MOH may be inaccurate. Activity-based costing assigns indirect costs to products and services based on the activities they require, making the applied MOH more accurate. This means using multiple cost drivers and having multiple POHR. <p> In this sense, activity-based costing _augments_ volume-based costing instead of _replacing_ it. <!--SR:!2025-05-18,66,348!2025-04-10,35,328-->
  - activity-based costing / two-staged allocation ::@:: Assign indirect costs to _activity cost pools_ (the costs over all pools _should_ sum up to the indirect costs). Then assign the pools to products or services. Note that an activity can be used by multiple products or services, and a product or service can use multiple pools. <!--SR:!2025-05-18,66,348!2025-06-12,86,368-->

    - activity-based costing / activity classification / batch-level ::@:: They support a batch (group of units/group of customers) at once, e.g. machine setup (one setup per batch), ordering materials, shipping a batch, etc. <!--SR:!2025-05-18,66,348!2025-05-18,66,348-->
    - activity-based costing / activity classification / unit-level ::@:: They support a unit or a customer individually, e.g. machining, part installation, product painting, serving a customer, etc. <!--SR:!2025-06-06,82,368!2025-05-18,66,348-->
  - activity-based costing / cost drivers ::@:: The cost drivers we have previously considered before ABC are _volume-based cost drivers_, e.g. direct materials, direct labor, machining hours, units produced, etc. In ABC, we also consider _non-volume-based cost drivers_, e.g. batch count, design count, processing time per unit, quality inspections, setup time, etc. <p> For each activity cost pool, we choose a cost driver that has a causal relationship with the activity, which should be non-volume-based cost drivers. <!--SR:!2025-04-09,34,328!2025-04-09,34,328-->
    - activity-based costing / cost drivers / advantages ::@:: By also considering non-volume-based cost drivers, it can assign indirect costs to products or services more accurately, especially those that require more indirect costs. <!--SR:!2025-06-13,87,368!2025-05-18,66,348-->

- [target costing](../../../../general/target%20costing.md) ::@:: It is an approach to determine a product's _life-cycle cost_ which should be sufficient to develop specified functionality and quality, while _ensuring_ its desired profit. <p> It differs from markup in that we use the market price (target price) and target profit to set the cost instead of the other way around.

- [contribution margin](../../../../general/contribution%20margin.md) ::@:: the selling price per unit minus the variable cost per unit <p> (alternative, in this course: sales revenue minus variable costs) <!--SR:!2025-06-27,91,386!2025-07-11,103,386-->
  - contribution margin / ratio ::@:: contribution margin per unit / selling price per unit <p> (alternative, in this course: contribution margin / sales revenue) <!--SR:!2025-06-10,73,366!2025-06-13,75,366-->
  - contribution margin / increased ::@:: It can also be used to account for increased sales. <p> You may use a _table_: increased sales; less: increased variable costs; \(subtotal:\) increased contribution margin; less: increased fixed costs; \(total:\) increased net operating income <!--SR:!2025-06-13,75,366!2025-04-26,37,326-->

- datetime: 2025-03-10T12:00:00+08:00/2025-03-10T13:20:00+08:00
- topic: cost behavior
- [variable costing](../../../../general/variable%20costing.md) ::@:: Under this method, manufacturing overhead is incurred in the period that a product is produced. This addresses the issue of absorption costing that allows income to rise as production rises. <p> Variable costing is generally not used for external reporting purposes. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, income statements must use absorption costing to comply with GAAP. <!--SR:!2025-06-14,76,366!2025-06-10,73,366-->
  - variable costing / purpose ::@:: cost accounting for internal decision making <!--SR:!2025-06-14,76,366!2025-07-04,97,386-->
  - variable costing / cost classification ::@:: costs are mainly split into fixed costs, variable costs <!--SR:!2025-06-12,74,366!2025-07-04,97,386-->
  - variable costing / manufacturing overhead ::@:: incurred in the period that a product is produced <!--SR:!2025-06-28,92,386!2025-07-09,101,386-->
  - variable costing / formula ::@:: (net) sales, less: variable costs, (subtotal:) _contribution margin_, less: fixed costs, (total:) net operating income <!--SR:!2025-06-26,90,386!2025-04-20,32,326-->
- [total absorption costing](../../../../general/total%20absorption%20costing.md) ::@:: Under an absorption cost method, management can push forward costs to the next period when products are sold. This artificially inflates profits in the period of production by incurring less cost than would be incurred under a variable costing system. <p> Variable costing is generally not used for external reporting purposes. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, income statements must use absorption costing to comply with GAAP. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,91,386!2025-06-10,73,366-->
  - total absorption costing / purpose ::@:: cost accounting for external financial reporting (GAAP) <!--SR:!2025-07-08,100,386!2025-06-27,91,386-->
  - total absorption costing / cost classification ::@:: costs are mainly split into manufacturing costs, non-manufacturing costs <!--SR:!2025-07-05,98,386!2025-06-27,91,386-->
  - total absorption costing / manufacturing overhead ::@:: divided between cost of goods sold (when overapplied, underapplied, or sold) and ending inventory (when unsold) <!--SR:!2025-07-08,100,386!2025-06-28,92,386-->
  - total absorption / formula ::@:: (net) sales, less: cost of goods sold, (subtotal:) _gross margin_, less: non-manufacturing expenses, (total:) net operating income <!--SR:!2025-04-25,36,326!2025-07-09,101,386-->
- variable costing
  - variable costing / from total absorption costing ::@:: Move all manufacturing (e.g. variable manufacturing costs) _and_ non-manufacturing (e.g. variable selling expenses) variable costs to variable costs. The variable costs should be based on units _sold_, not _manufactured_. <p> Move all manufacturing (e.g. manufacturing overhead) _and_ non-manufacturing (e.g. general and administrative expenses) fixed costs to fixed costs. _Importantly_, _all_ manufacturing overhead incurred (instead of the portion corresponding to sold goods) during the period is expensed. <!--SR:!2025-04-09,16,306!2025-04-24,35,326-->
  - variable costing / vs. total absorption costing ::@:: In the former, manufacturing overhead is expensed in the period the goods are produced. In the latter, manufacturing overhead is expensed in the period the goods are sold. <p> So the calculated net operating income differs. <!--SR:!2025-06-26,90,386!2025-05-13,50,346-->
    - variable costing / vs. total absorption costing / net operating income (NOP) ::@:: absorption NOP โ variable NOP = change in ending inventory ร manufacturing overhead per unit <p> Intuitively, changes in ending inventory reflect imbalance between production and sales. When production > sales, inventory increases and absorption NOP > variable NOP. When production < sales, inventory decreases and absorption NOP < variable NOP. <!--SR:!2025-06-04,68,366!2025-07-05,98,386-->

  - costโvolumeโprofit analysis / graph ::@:: The graph shows both profit method and contribution method: ![costโvolumeโprofit analysis graph](../../../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/CVP-TC-FC-VC-Sales-Contrib-VC-PL-compat.svg) <!--SR:!2025-07-09,101,386!2025-06-29,92,386-->
  - costโvolumeโprofit analysis / unit contribution margin method ::@:: Find the _unit_ contribution margin. Then find _break-even units_ by dividing _fixed_ costs by unit contribution margin. Then find _break-even sales_ by multiplying break-even units by selling price. <p> You may use a _table_. (But really, is it necessary?) <!--SR:!2025-07-10,102,386!2025-04-30,40,346-->
    - costโvolumeโprofit analysis / unit contribution margin method / target profit ::@:: Find the _unit_ contribution margin. Then find _target units_ by adding fixed costs _and_ target profit, and then dividing it by unit contribution margin. Then find _target sales_ by multiplying target units by selling price. <!--SR:!2025-06-14,76,366!2025-07-10,102,386-->
  - costโvolumeโprofit analysis / contribution margin ratio method ::@:: Find the contribution margin _ratio_. Then find _break-even sales_ by dividing _fixed_ costs by contribution margin ratio. <p> You may use a _table_. (But really, is it necessary?) <!--SR:!2025-06-14,76,366!2025-04-25,36,326-->
    - costโvolumeโprofit analysis / contribution margin ratio method / target sales ::@:: Find the contribution margin _ratio_. Then find _target sales_ by adding fixed costs _and_ target profit, and then dividing it by contribution margin ratio. <!--SR:!2025-07-08,100,386!2025-06-08,71,366-->

    - costโvolumeโprofit analysis / assumptions / linearity ::@:: The behavior of both costs and revenues is linear throughout the _relevant range_ of activity. <p> For example, volume discounts on purchases or sales are precluded. <!--SR:!2025-06-06,73,366!2025-06-12,74,366-->
    - costโvolumeโprofit analysis / assumptions / classification ::@:: Costs can be classified accurately as either fixed or variable. <!--SR:!2025-06-26,90,386!2025-06-29,93,386-->
    - costโvolumeโprofit analysis / assumptions / factors ::@:: Changes in activity/volume are the only factors that affect costs. <p> For example, learning curves, productivity gains, and volume discounts are precluded. <!--SR:!2025-06-28,92,386!2025-06-12,74,366-->
    - costโvolumeโprofit analysis / assumptions / production ::@:: All units produced are sold (there is no ending finished goods inventory). <p> This simplification is because some costs vary with production while others vary with sales. No ending inventory change also means the net operating income/profit is the same between total absorption costing and variable costing. <!--SR:!2025-06-14,76,366!2025-06-09,72,366-->
    - costโvolumeโprofit analysis / assumptions / product mix ::@:: When a company sells more than one type of product, the product mix (the ratio of each product to total sales) will remain constant. <!--SR:!2025-07-05,98,386!2025-07-11,103,386-->
  - costโvolumeโprofit analysis / margin of safety ::@:: It is the difference between actual/budgeted (net) sales and break-even point: <p> actual/budgeted (net) sales โ break-even point <p> It represents the strength of the business. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,102,386!2025-06-28,92,386-->
