- topic: introduction to managerial accounting
- course logistics
- [management accounting](../../../../general/management%20accounting.md)
  - management accounting / purpose ::@:: decision-making orientation: provide useful information to internal managers for making decisions
  - management accounting / vs. financial accounting ::@:: audience, detail level, information nature, report frequency, report types
    - management accounting / vs. financial accounting / audience ::@:: internal parties, e.g. managers, employees (sometimes); external parties, e.g. creditors, investors, regulators
    - management accounting / vs. financial accounting / detail level ::@:: decision-making level; whole-company level
    - management accounting / vs. financial accounting / information nature ::@:: future oriented, relevant, subjective; historical, objective, reliable
    - management accounting / vs. financial accounting / report frequency ::@:: prepared as needed, can be daily or even real-time; prepared periodically, e.g. monthly, quarterly, yearly
    - management accounting / vs. financial accounting / report types ::@:: various internal reports, e.g. budget, cost reports, performance evaluations; financial statements according to GAAP/IFRS
  - management accounting / functions ::@:: infinite cycle: plan, implement, control; all about decision-making
  - management accounting / role of cost ::@:: inventory valuation; profitability determination; provides management information for decision-making
- organization types ::@:: manufacturing company, merchandising company, service company
  - manufacturing company ::@:: purchase raw material from suppliers, manufacture finished products, sell finished products
  - merchandising company ::@:: sell manufactured goods; wholesalers: to other businesses; retailers: to the general public
  - service company ::@:: provide service to clients or customers
- cost classifications ::@:: manufacturing, relevance, timing, traceability, variability
  - types of costs / manufacturing ::@:: manufacturing vs. non-manufacturing
  - types of costs / relevance ::@:: relevance vs. irrelevance
  - types of costs / timing ::@:: product vs. period
  - types of costs / traceability ::@:: direct vs. indirect
  - types of costs / variability ::@:: variable vs. fixed
- [direct costs](../../../../general/direct%20costs.md) ::@:: convenient and easily traceable to a cost object, e.g. cost of labors and materials to produce a product
  - [cost object](../../../../general/cost%20object.md) ::@:: a term used primarily in cost accounting to describe something to which costs are assigned
- [indirect costs](../../../../general/indirect%20costs.md) ::@:: inconvenient or hardly traceable to a cost object, e.g. advertising, depreciation, supervision, utilities
- [variable cost](../../../../general/variable%20cost.md) ::@:: costs that change according to the activity level; usually we assume the variable cost is proportional to the activity level (constant marginal cost)
- [fixed cost](../../../../general/fixed%20cost.md) ::@:: costs that do not change regardless of the activity level (within a reasonable range); average cost or per-unit cost varies inversely with the activity level
- [manufacturing cost](../../../../general/manufacturing%20cost.md) ::@:: all costs to produce the physical product; direct materials cost + direct labor cost + manufacturing overhead cost
  - [direct materials cost](../../../../general/direct%20materials%20cost.md) ::@:: major material input that are conveniently and easily traceable to the final product, e.g. food ingredients in a pizza, glass windows in a car
  - [direct labor cost](../../../../general/direct%20labor%20cost.md) ::@:: labor cost that are conveniently and easily traceable to the final product,e.g. wages to assembly line workers, wages to cooks, but _not_ wages to directors
  - [manufacturing overhead](../../../../general/overhead%20(business).md) (MOH) ::@:: all costs needed to manufacture a product that are neither direct materials nor direct labor (i.e. indirect costs), e.g. depreciation, maintenance, insurance, property taxes, repairs, utilities, wages to supervisors
  - prime cost ::@:: direct materials + direct labor
  - conversion cost ::@:: direct labor + manufacturing overhead
  - non-manufacturing cost ::@:: includes all other costs that are not manufacturing costs, e.g. general & administration (G&A), marketing, selling
- product cost ::@:: cost that is incurred per product, e.g. manufacturing costs; goes to "cost of goods sold", and generates future benefits
- period cost ::@:: cost that is incurred periodically, e.g. non-manufacturing costs; goes to "period expenses", and does not generate future benefits (directly)
- [relevant cost](../../../../genera/relevant%20cost.md) ::@:: a cost that has potential to influence decision making, which differs between decision alternatives (differential/incremental costs) and must be incurred in the future (non-sunk costs)
  - irrelevant cost ::@:: costs that are not relevant, e.g. amortization, depreciation, sunk costs
- out-of-pocket costs (explicit cost in economics) ::@:: costs that involve actual outgoing cash
- [opportunity cost](../../../../general/opportunity%20cost.md) (same as that in economics) ::@:: forgone benefit of the best decision that is _not_ taken

## week 1 lecture 2

- datetime: 2025-02-05T12:00:00+08:00/2025-02-05T13:20:00+08:00
- topic: job order costing
- [job costing](../../../../general/job%20costing.md) ::@:: accounting which tracks the costs and revenues by "job" and enables standardized reporting of profitability by job
  - job costing / the other costing method ::@:: process costing
  - job costing / vs. process costing ::@:: approach, cost accumulation, product type, report types
    - job costing / vs. process costing / approach ::@:: customized to the needs of clients or customers; mass produced using standardized processes
    - job costing / vs. process costing / cost accumulation ::@:: accumulates per customer/project/job; accumulates per process
    - job costing / vs. process costing / product type ::@:: unique products and services (e.g. construction projects); homogeneous products and services (e.g. soft drinks)
    - job costing / vs. process costing / report types ::@:: job cost sheet per customer/project/job; production report per process
  - job cost / manufacturing costs ::@:: direct materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead; add them together
  - job cost / source documents ::@:: documents to assign direct costs to jobs; direct materials: materials requisition form, direct labor: labor time ticket
  - job cost / materials requisition form ::@:: The form should have "Materials Requisition Form", a number (e.g. MR 42), date, job number (e.g. 42), description, a table listing the materials, and an authorized signature. <p> The table should contain a row for each type of materials. The columns are "Material Description" (include numbers or sizes if needed), "Quantity", "Unit Cost", and "Total Cost". Also calculate the "Total Cost" for the entire table for "Total Cost".
  - job cost / (direct) labor time ticket ::@:: The form should have "Direct Labor Time Ticket", dates (e.g. Monday 2/10—Friday 2/14, 2025), ticket number (e.g. TT 42), employee, a table listing the labor, and an authorized signature. <p> The table should contain a row for each consecutive working period. The columns are "Date", "Time Started", "Time Ended", "Total Hours", "Hourly Rate', "Total Amount", and "Job Number" (cell values may be text, e.g. "Training"). Also calculate the "Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Whatever Total" for the entire table for "Total Hours" and "Total Amount".
  - job cost / job cost sheet ::@:: The form should have "Job Cost Sheet", job number (e.g. 42), date started, date completed, description, 3 tables in the middle (resp. with the header "Actual Direct Materials", "Actual Direct Labor", "Applied Manufacturing Overhead"), and a bottom section with the header "Cost Summary". <p> For the table "Actual Direct Materials", the columns are "Req. No" and "Amount". For the table "Actual Direct Labor", the columns are "Ticket", "Hours", and "Amount". For the table "Applied Manufacturing Overhead", the columns are (unit for primary cost driver, e.g. "Hours" for label) and "Amount". <p> For the section "Cost Summary", write the 3 numbers above vertically and label them, and then calculate the "Total Cost" for this job.
  - job cost / [manufacturing overhead](../../../../general/factory%20overhead.md) (MOH) ::@:: Applied Manufacturing Overhead = Predetermined Overhead Rate (POHR) × Actual Cost Driver <p> The actual cost driver/allocation base may be direct labor costs (less common), direct labor hours (more common), direct materials costs, etc.
    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / rationale & handling ::@:: Such costs may be impossible or difficult to trace to particular jobs, consists of many different items, and may not be known until the end of a period. <p> So what we do is identify the cost driver (e.g. direct labor costs, direct labor hours, direct materials costs) and use it as an allocation base. Then use estimates to find the predetermined overhead rate (POHR). This rate is "predetermined" because it is determined before a period begins.
    - job cost / manufacturing overhead (MOH) / underapplied & overapplied ::@:: The _applied_ manufacturing overhead found using POHR is only an _estimate_. At the end of a period, we can find the _actual_ manufacturing overhead. If applied MOH > actual MOH then it is overapplied, and vice versa. If applied MOH < actual MOH then it is underapplied. <p> This discrepancy is accounted for by adjusting the cost of goods sold (COGS), which will be discussed below.
