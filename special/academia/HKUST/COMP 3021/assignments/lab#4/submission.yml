    FAQs:


    Q: Should we include a period at the end of the sentence?

    A: It is fine either way.



    Q: Are we matching words or substrings?

    A: Substrings. E.g. "Hand" is matched when "and" is the keyword. Matching on words
    will require regular expression, which is out of scope for this course.



    Q: Should we make sure that the date format is the same as in the expected output?

    A: No, similar to lab3.



    Q: Can we change the compareTo function directly? Will it affect our lab3 grade?

    A: You can change it directly. It will not affect your lab3 submission.'
