    FAQs



    1. What does it exactly mean for "have at least three commits separated in two
    days"?

    A: You should have at least 3 commits, and the span of the total time over the
    three commits is at least 2 days.

    2. What is the @Data annotation on AccountManager? The description does not mention
    it.

    A: This is from the Lombok package, I forgot to delete it. You can delete it or
    use the Lombok package.

    3. What is the Order.getRestaurant() method used in DispatchSystem.writeOrders()?
    I neither see that method in the description nor see there''s any fields in Order
    related to Restaurant.

    A: This is one of the getters and setters methods of a class. I would say they
    are trivial to mention in the description. You may add them to your needs, i.e.
    you need to add the getRestaurant() method to cater to the writeOrders() method.

    4. Are the methods Rider.getRiderById(), Customer.getCustomerById() and Restaurant.getRestaurantById()
    static? The description seems not mentioning it but I think it could be static.

    A: Yes, make it static.

    5. Why are all Integer, Double, etc. not primitive in this PA? I thought there
    might be potential NPEs.

    A: The boxing classes can be used in Java collections directly while the primitives
    cannot. And the NPEs will also help you prevent the hidden logic bugs in your
    project.

    6. What should I do if I encounter an account with an already registered ID?

    A: This is a typo in SampleInputAcounts.txt. You do not need to handle the case
    and it will not happen in the grading data. You can also modify those 3 records
    to sequential ids, but don''t forget that the output files may be changed accordingly.

    7. What does the member estimatedTime mean?

    A: The field estimatedTime in Order class means the time elapsed in the delivery
    process.

    8. Does it has any limitation on access control of any instance variable defined
    in any class? (Like private, public, protected, default.)

    A: We will test your code in JUnit Test (test/java/hk/ust/comp3021/*.java) by
    invoking the functions just like you did in the main method in DispatchSystem.java.
    You may test your accessibility on your own by simply implementing the JUnit Tests.'
