    FAQ




    Part 2.6 (Parallel Array Task) is NOT a bonus part. It is mandatory.



    In part 2.6, you are allowed to use 1 mutable temporary array for each algorithm.



    You should make sure that you copied the "build.gradle" file into your repository,
    as the build script is different from the lab template.



    If you got garbled characters in the test output, try to change your console font.
    Try to check Editor -> Color Scheme -> Console Font, and change the font to something
    else, e.g. something used by the editor font.



    The map function on a stream is not considered as mutation.



    Adding elements to a list, or changing its elements, is considered mutation.



    Local variables are variables defined inside a function. Class fields or function
    parameters are not considered as local variables.



    There is a typo in TaskPoolTest.TestTerminate. Please change line 52 from

    tasks.add(() -> {



    to


    pool.addTask(() -> {



    and delete line 56, i.e.

    assert false;






    For the performance requirement in task 2.6, we will run the tests 5 times and
    check the best run. As long as your speedup for that run is good (takes 50% time
    comparing with the sequential implementation), you will get the full score.'
