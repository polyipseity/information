    "Based on the project problem statement, work together with your teammates
    to prepare the following information and have it integrated into a single document
    in PDF format:


    class diagram (team score) [teamwork]



    use-case diagram (team score) [teamwork]



    use-case specifications for all 3 tasks (individual score) [individual work]






    NOTE: One submission per team (Only the Team leader should submit the PDF file
    and GitHub repository link in the comment).

    At the top of the document, indicate in the document (i.e., pdf file you submit
    for activity 1) how the 3 tasks are allocated within the team. Individual scores
    could vary depending on the sub-scores attained in the task-specific (use-case
    specifications).

    The TA will also review your team project repository on GitHub to ensure a proper
    README file is present showing the Team ID, members’ personal particulars (emails,
    Names, Student ID, GitHub ID), and individual task assignment. Ensure your GitHub
    repository is private.

    Here is the list of TAs' GitHub accounts for you to invite them as collaborators:
