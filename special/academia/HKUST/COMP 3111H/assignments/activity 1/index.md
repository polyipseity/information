Based on the project problem statement, work together with your teammates to prepare the following information and have it integrated into a single document in PDF format:

- class diagram (team score) \[teamwork\]  
- use-case diagram (team score) \[teamwork\]
- use-case specifications for all 3 tasks (individual score) \[individual work\]

__NOTE:__ One submission per team (__Only__ the Team leader should submit the __PDF file and GitHub repository link in the comment__).

At the top of the document, indicate in the document (i.e., pdf file you submit for activity 1) how the 3 tasks are allocated within the team. Individual scores could vary depending on the sub-scores attained in the task-specific (use-case specifications).

The TA will also review your team project repository on GitHub to ensure a proper README file is present showing the Team ID, members' personal particulars (emails, Names, Student ID, GitHub ID), and individual task assignment. Ensure your GitHub repository is __private__.

Here is the list of TAs' GitHub accounts for you to invite them as collaborators:

| __NAME__     | __EMAIL__    | __GitHub Account__ |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------ |
| \[redacted\] | \[redacted\] | \[redacted\]       |
