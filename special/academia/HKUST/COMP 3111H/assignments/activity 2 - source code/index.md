__Required:__ Submit the project as a zip file to facilitate the process of assessment. Also, comment your GitHub Repository link together with a zip file.

Make sure that the Java application delivered by your team is fully functional, with all members having completed the tasks assigned. We will download this zip file or clone the project from the Team Repo to a local machine and conduct testing and assessment.

The following information has to be made available on the Team Repo (all integrated in a single document, or in a collection of linked documents):

In particular, you might present the characteristics of your system and the WoW factors, analysis of your algorithms developed for the tasks, justifications on the results of your recommendation, specific assumptions and limitations, etc.

__No late submission will be accepted.__
