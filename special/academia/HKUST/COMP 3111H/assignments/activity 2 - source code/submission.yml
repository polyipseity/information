    "Required: Submit the project as a zip file to facilitate the process of
    assessment. Also, comment your GitHub Repository link together with a zip file.

    Make sure that the Java application delivered by your team is fully functional,
    with all members having completed the tasks assigned. We will download this zip
    file or clone the project from the Team Repo to a local machine and conduct testing
    and assessment.

    The following information has to be made available on the Team Repo (all integrated
    in a single document, or in a collection of linked documents):


    Screenshots of the execution of the application showing sample inputs and outputs



    Report on the unit testing for the implemented tasks (100% pass)



    Report on the coverage test (>65% branch coverage)



    Documentation on the implemented tasks using JavaDoc



    Supplementary Notes






    Your supplementary notes could be in any format (PDF document, PPT slides, linked
    web pages, screen capture, video clip).  Supplementary notes might include any
    information that would facilitate TA to assess and grade your work. In particular,
    you might present the characteristics of your system and the WoW factors, analysis
    of your algorithms developed for the tasks, justifications on the results of your
    recommendation, specific assumptions and limitations, etc.

    No late submission will be accepted."
