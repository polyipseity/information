## hints

1. Unified Modeling Language \(UML\) ::@:: It is a general-purpose, object-oriented, visual modeling language that provides a way to visualize the architecture and design of a system; like a blueprint. <p> It makes us think about the world in a certain way.
2. UML classifiers ::@:: They are _abstractions_ to group a _collection_ of entities in the _application domain_, e.g. association, attribute, class, operation, etc.
3. attribute properties ::@:: name \(required\), type \(required\), visibility, initial value \(optional\), multiplicity \(optional\), mutability/changeability
4. class ::@:: Instances of a class have _common_ attributes, operations, relations with other objects, and semantics.
5. interface ::@:: It is an _abstract class_ that has _operations_ only.
