## hints

1. UML / [§ association generalizations](UML.md#association%20generalizations) ::@:: _Generalization_ represent a "is-a" or "kind-of" relationship between _subclasses_ and a _superclass_. The subclasses are said to be the _same kind_, and should have _similar_ \(but not the same\) attributes, operations, and associations. It is represented by _inheritance_ in object-oriented programming languages. It allows us to _simplify_ diagrams for _clarity_. <!--SR:!2026-01-28,58,310!2026-02-07,67,310-->
2. association constraint: xor ::@:: `{xor}`; a _dashed line_ linking two associations; exactly one of the two associations can be _instantiated_ \(have _instances_ or _links_\) <!--SR:!2026-02-02,62,310!2026-02-05,65,310-->
3. basis path testing / benefits ::@:: Every statement executes at least once. Both sides of control flow decisions are taken at least once. All of these are done without enumerating every possible input combination. <p> Thus, it helps uncover defects tied to specific branches or loop conditions. <!--SR:!2026-02-06,66,310!2026-02-03,63,310-->
4. software testing / goals / verification ::@:: Is the implementation correct? Most _unit/integration tests_ focus here. <!--SR:!2026-02-01,61,310!2026-02-04,64,310-->
5. software testing / goals / validation ::@:: Does the product meet user requirements? Perform _acceptance tests_. <!--SR:!2026-02-04,64,310!2026-02-07,67,310-->
