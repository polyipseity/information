## hints

1. UML / [ยง modeling use cases](../UML.md#modeling%20use%20cases) ::@:: A _use case_ captures a _concrete_ way an _actor_ interacts with the system to accomplish _part_ of its functionality. It is written from the actor's perspective and describes a complete, normal _sequence_ of _events_ that starts with the actor _initiating_ the interaction. _Alternative_ or _exceptional_ flows are omitted at first; they can be added in the use case _specification_ \(but not use case _diagram_\) later as needed. <p> In UML terms, a use case is a _stereotype_ of a class \(a kind of class\); it's a _classifier_ that represents a set of interactions. A _scenario_, on the other hand, is an _instance_ of that classifier. <!--SR:!2025-11-13,10,270!2025-11-10,7,250-->
2. UML / [ยง modeling actors](../UML.md#modeling%20actors) ::@:: An _actor_ represents any entity that _interacts_ directly with a system from _outside_ its boundary. It can be a person, another system, or a role played by multiple people. In UML terms, an actor is a _stereotype_ of a class \(a kind of class\); the actor itself is a _classifier_ and each concrete _instance_ corresponds to a specific user or external system. It is possible that some identified actors have the same name as some of the identified classes. Use cases are _discovered_ from actors. <p> Each actor has one or more _roles_ when _interacting_ with the system. A single user may assume several distinct roles, and multiple users can share the same role. Actors supply input to the system or receive output from it; in particular, input/output devices themselves are _never_ actors. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,15,290!2025-11-18,15,290-->
3. [non-functional requirement](../../../../../general/non-functional%20requirement.md) ::@:: It is a requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours. They are contrasted with functional requirements that define specific behavior or functions. <p> It places _constraints_ on use cases or the system. <!--SR:!2025-11-19,16,290!2025-11-19,16,290-->
4.

5. __Preconditions__ \(if any\) ::@:: conditions that must hold before the use case can start; they state _what_ is required, not _how_ it is achieved. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,15,290!2025-11-18,15,290-->
