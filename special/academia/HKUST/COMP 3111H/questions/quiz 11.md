## hints

1. UML / [§ association multiplicity](../UML.md#association%20multiplicity) ::@:: A _multiplicity_ of an association is the possible numbers of the association that an instance of the _current_ class may be related to. It is an _application domain_ constraint. Note that this is written on the side of the _other_ class rather than the current class. This should not be confused with how multiplicity is placed on the entity–relationship model \(ER model\), which is commonly used for databases. <!--SR:!2026-01-25,67,310!2026-01-25,67,310-->
2. code review / vs. testing ::@:: Reviews or inspections can be considered as part of testing, as they both detect faults to improve quality. <!--SR:!2026-01-25,67,310!2026-01-25,67,310-->
3. requirements elicitation / importance / cost ::@:: Whenever there is a defect, the later we discover it, the higher the cost it takes to fix it \(usually grows exponentially\). This is the cheapest when we are specifying the requirements, being the first step. <!--SR:!2026-01-25,67,310!2026-01-25,67,310-->
4. code refactoring / effort ::@:: Although refactoring incurs _upfront_ effort, it pays dividends in reduced defect rates, easier feature integration, and higher team productivity. The _overall_ effort becomes lower. <!--SR:!2026-01-25,67,310!2025-12-20,37,290-->
5. configuration management / components ::@:: change management, version management, system building, release management <!--SR:!2026-01-25,67,310!2026-01-25,67,310-->
