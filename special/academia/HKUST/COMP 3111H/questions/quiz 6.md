## hints

1. software engineering / jobs ::@:: Coding or programming is only "programming-in-the-small", which includes implementation, validating user inputs, etc. <p> Software engineering is "programming-in-the-large", which includes communication, execution, etc. <!--SR:!2026-01-03,67,310!2026-01-03,67,310-->
2. project risk management / mitigations ::@:: avoid before it happens, confine in case it happens, mitigate after it happens, monitor to know when it happens <!--SR:!2025-11-28,37,290!2026-01-03,67,310-->
3. requirements elicitation / importance / failures ::@:: Major causes of software development failures or problems: changing requirements, incomplete requirements, unneeded system, unrealistic expectations, user involvement lacking, etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-28,37,290!2026-01-03,67,310-->
4. software requirements specification / name ::@:: \(__this course__: use _system requirements specification_\) <!--SR:!2026-01-03,67,310!2026-01-03,67,310-->
