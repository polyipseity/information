## hints

1. software testing / non-goals ::@:: It cannot show the _absence_ of software errors, e.g. ensuring no bugs.
2. software testing / goals ::@:: Find discrepancies between _expected_ and _actual_ behavior, e.g. finding bugs. <p> There are 2 aspects: _validation_ and _verification_.
3. test case / taxonomy / regression ::@:: Re-tests after _changes_ to ensure _no new defects appear_; mixes white and black box techniques, with more emphasized on white box.
4. [white-box testing](../../../../../general/white-box%20testing.md) ::@:: It is a method of software testing that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. black-box testing).
5. system testing / performance ::@:: Assess stress (max concurrent users), volume (large data sets), security (access controls), timing (real-time constraints), recovery (fail-over scenarios), etc.
