## hints

1. [UML](../UML.md) / entity classes ::@:: Entity classes model long-lived and often persistent information. They represent real-world concepts such as people, events, courses, or departments. They are treated as dynamic objects within the analysis model but typically correspond to persistent data stored in a database. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
2. [UML](../UML.md) / analysis classes ::@:: Partitioning a use case distributes responsibilities across boundary, entity and control classes. Boundary classes handle environment and external interaction, entity classes manage data storage and processing, and control classes implement the specific logic of the use case. This separation facilitates _localization_ of changes and improves maintainability and _traceability_ \(to use cases\) by resulting in a _stable system_. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
3. [software project management](../software%20project%20management.md) / Gantt chart ::@:: Gantt charts provide an at-a-glance view of resource utilisation and potential schedule conflicts. It cannot, however, provide critical path activity, and a PERT chart is used for this purpose instead. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
4. equivalence partitioning / boundary values / unordered ::@:: For a set of values or a specific type \(unordered\), test _all valid values_ \(if possible\) and at least _one invalid value_. Examples: boolean, enumeration, etc. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
5. requirements / elicitation / activities / understand ::@:: collect system _requirements_ and _constraints_, and determine _development scope_ and _design goals_ \(for reducing design _complexity_\) <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
