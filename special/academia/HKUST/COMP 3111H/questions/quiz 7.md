## hints

1. requirements / elicitation / activities / understand ::@:: collect system _requirements_ and _constraints_, and determine _development scope_ and _design goals_ \(for reducing design _complexity_\) <!--SR:!2025-09-29,4,270!2025-09-29,4,270-->
2. [software development process](../../../../../general/software%20development%20process.md) ::@:: It prescribes a process for developing software. It typically divides an overall effort into smaller steps or sub-processes that are intended to ensure high-quality results. The process may describe specific deliverables – artifacts to be created and completed. <p> \(__this course__: It is a process _template_ that is _adaptable_ for different application domains. It aids in _dividing_ work.\) <!--SR:!2025-09-29,4,270!2025-09-29,4,270-->
3. [domain model](../../../../../general/domain%20model.md) ::@:: It is a conceptual model of the domain that incorporates both behavior \(__this course__: associations\) and data \(__this course__: classes\). <p> \(__this course__: They are things for which _data_ must be stored.\) <!--SR:!2025-09-29,4,270!2025-09-29,4,270-->
4. UML / [§ use case models](../UML.md#use%20case%20models) / overview ::@:: _Use case modeling_ aims to capture the _system behavior_ from the user's point of view. It helps to capture _data_ and _functional_ requirements, plan development _iterations_, and _validate_ the system. Overall, it drives _development effort_. It should describe all _required_ functionalities. <!--SR:!2025-09-29,4,270!2025-09-29,4,270-->
5. UML / [§ use case diagrams](../UML.md#use%20case%20diagrams) / associations ::@:: ... Finally, for each actor potentially initiating a use case, draw an _solid arrow_ pointing from the actor to the use case, indicating an _unidirectional association_ with the _implicit_ association name "use". Optionally, identify _communication_ associations \(flow of information between a \(system\) actor and a use case\), and draw a _solid line_ \(no arrow as it is _bidirectional_\) connecting the actor and the use case. No need to _name_ the association as the "communication" association name is _implied_ in the context of a use case diagram. <!--SR:!2025-09-29,4,270!2025-09-29,4,270-->
