## hints

1. [acceptance testing](../../../../../general/acceptance%20testing.md) ::@:: It is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met. It may involve chemical tests, physical tests, or performance tests. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,14,290!2025-12-25,16,290-->
2. cyclomatic complexity / interpretation ::@:: The value reflects the logical richness of the procedure; _internally_, higher values mean more _testing effort_ or less _maintainability_; _externally_, higher values means less _safety_ \(how likely it is to be error free\). <!--SR:!2025-12-24,15,290!2025-12-24,15,290-->
3. [integration testing](../../../../../general/integration%20testing.md) ::@:: It is a form of software testing in which multiple software components, modules, or services are tested together to verify they work as expected when combined. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,14,290!2025-12-24,15,290-->
4. system testing vs. acceptance testing
    - system testing / nature ::@:: black-box, run by independent test group <!--SR:!2025-12-25,16,290!2025-12-23,14,290-->
    - acceptance testing / nature ::@:: black-box, run by client or user <!--SR:!2025-12-24,15,290!2025-12-25,16,290-->
5. behavioral testing ::@:: It tests the system from the outside, making it a form of _black-box testing_. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,14,290!2025-12-23,14,290-->
