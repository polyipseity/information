## hints

1. [software quality assurance](../software%20quality%20assurance.md) / aspects ::@:: Quality _assurance_ defines organizational standards to produce high quality software. Quality _planning_ selects and tailors relevant standards for a specific product. Quality _control_ verifies that these standards are followed through audits, inspections, and metrics collection. Together they form the _WHAT_ (standards)}, _HOW_ (methods), and _MONITOR_ (enforcement) of SQA.
2.
    - [software quality assurance](../software%20quality%20assurance.md) / SEI Capability Maturity Model ::@:: SEI CMM is a framework for assessing and improving software development processes.
    - [software quality assurance](../software%20quality%20assurance.md) / People Capability Maturity Model ::@:: The People Capability Maturity Model (PCMM) evaluates and enhances the knowledge and skill base of an organization’s workforce.
3. [software quality assurance](../software%20quality%20assurance.md) / standards ::@:: A _technical standard_ establishes uniform engineering criteria, methods, processes and practices. In software engineering we distinguish two main types: _product standards_ define the desired characteristics that every artifact must exhibit to be considered quality; and _process standards_ prescribe how work should be carried out so that quality outcomes are reliably produced. Each project decides whether a standard is ignored, used as‑is, modified or newly created.
4. black-box testing / state-based testing / workflow ::@:: For a class, use a _state-machine diagram_ to derive test cases. For each _transition_, derive a _representative set_ of _events_ \("stimuli"\) that cause the transition. <p> Before each event, set an object of the class to the desired state. Apply the event. Verify that the actual state matches the expected state, ensuring correct state progression. <p> This is similar to equivalence testing but on _transitions_.
5. [software quality assurance](../software%20quality%20assurance.md) / metrics ::@:: An example of a non-software metric is _quality of conformance_, which is the degree to which the design specifications are followed during manufacturing.
