## week 1 pre-lecture

- topic: introduction; complexity of software development; handling complexity; software engineering
- [software engineering](../../../../general/software%20engineering.md) ::@:: It is a branch of both computer science and engineering focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. It involves applying engineering principles and computer programming expertise to develop software systems that meet user needs.
- [source lines of code](../../../../general/source%20lines%20of%20code.md) \(SLOC\) ::@:: It is a software metric used to measure the size of a computer program by counting the number of lines in the text of the program's source code.
  - source lines of code / acronyms ::@:: LLOC: logical lines of code; logical SLOC <br/> LOC: lines of code; physical SLOC <br/> MLOC: million lines of code <br/> SLOC: source lines of code
  - source lines of code / examples ::@:: Rome: Total War &lt; Boeing 787 &lt; F-35 Fighter Jet &lt; Windows 7 &lt; Windows 10 &lt; Facebook &lt; Mac OS X &lt; luxury passenger car
  - source lines of code / effort ::@:: Effort is not _linearly_ proportional to source lines of code!!
- [software maintenance](../../../../general/software%20maintenance.md) ::@:: It is the modification of software after delivery. <p> It is often considered lower skilled and less rewarding than new development. As such, it is a common target for outsourcing or offshoring.
  - software maintenance / complexity ::@:: It can be complex. Indeed, given the large amount of existing software, it uses the most time of most developers.
- [programming complexity](../../../../general/programming%20complexity.md) ::@:: It is a term that includes software properties that affect internal interactions.
  - programming complexity / sources ::@:: application domain, communication, management, tools
    - programming complexity / sources / application domain ::@:: A problem is often _complex_ and outside the domain of most developers \(i.e. not _domain experts_\).
    - programming complexity / sources / communication ::@:: Clients and developers have different _background_, _vocabulary_, etc. which is made worse by _ambiguity_ of human languages.
    - programming complexity / sources / management ::@:: _Dividing_ a project and _reassembling_ it is difficult. _Coordination_ between different _parts_ and _people_ is also difficult.
    - programming complexity / sources / tools ::@:: Creating useful _tools_ for software development is also complex. Indeed, creating the tools themselves also require software engineering.
  - programming complexity / problems ::@:: development, quality
    - programming complexity / problems / quality ::@:: abandonment \(London Stock Exchange; after 5 years of development\), inflexible, unreliable \(Ariane 5 \(rocket\)\), unsafe \(London Ambulance Service; fell twice in 1992\), etc.
      - programming complexity / problems / quality / examples ::@:: A small software update to Amazon, a large and complex website, caused \$2.8 million in lost revenue.
- [Ariane 5](../../../../general/Ariane%205.md) ::@:: It is a retired European heavy-lift space launch vehicle operated by Arianespace for the European Space Agency \(ESA\).
  - Ariane 5 / notable launches
    - Ariane 5 / notable launches / first test flight ::@:: Ariane 5's first test flight \(Ariane 5 Flight 501\) on 4 June 1996 failed, with the rocket self-destructing 37 seconds after launch because of a malfunction in the control software.
      - Ariane 5 / notable launches / first test flight / cause ::@:: A data conversion from 64-bit floating-point value to 16-bit signed integer value to be stored in a variable representing horizontal bias caused a processor trap \(operand error\) because the floating-point value was too large to be represented by a 16-bit signed integer.
- programming complexity
  - programming complexity / problems
    - programming complexity / problems / development ::@:: does not meet user requirements, difficult to measure progress, over budget, over time, etc.
      - programming complexity / problems / development / statistics ::@:: \(2012\) For _large_ software projects: deliver less value &gt; over budget &gt; company threatening &gt; over time &gt; etc.
  - programming complexity / mitigations ::@:: There are many desirable _characteristics_ considered part of quality. It is impossible and unnecessary to achieve all of them. <p> Instead, we should under the client's _goals_ and _prioritize_ certain characteristics. This reduces complexity somewhat.
    - programming complexity / mitigations / characteristics ::@:: correct, efficient, evolvable, interoperable, maintainable, portable, productive, reliable, repairable, reusable, robust, timely, usable, verifiable, visible, etc.
- [modular programming](../../../../general/modular%20programming.md) ::@:: It is a programming paradigm that emphasizes organizing the functions of a codebase into independent modules â€“ each providing an aspect of a computer program in its entirety without providing other aspects.
  - modular programming / motivation ::@:: Humans cannot understand things that are too _complex_. Often, we break down a complex systems into _modules_, parts of a system that makes sense to _consider separately_ and interact with other modules. This is known as _divide and conquer_.
  - modular programming / module ::@:: It is a part of a system that can be _considered separately_. To model _interactions_ with other modules, they are limited to _interfaces_, which _abstracts_ and _encapsulates_ a module via _information hiding_.
    - modular programming / module / abstraction ::@:: The internals of a module are hidden away. Interaction is defined via its interface only. The usage of the module by other modules can be understood by looking at its interface only \(ideally\). This reduces complexity of the system.
    - modular programming / module / encapsulation ::@:: When we want to modify a module, we only need to modify the module without changing other modules \(ideally\). The internals of a module can be changed without affecting other modules \(ideally\). This reduces maintenance burden.
  - modular programming / advantages ::@:: bug reduction, _incremental_ development, maintainability, productive teams, reusability <p> This makes software development _more predictable_, leading to better cost and time estimation.
- [engineer](../../../../general/engineer.md) ::@:: It is a practitioner of engineering. <p> They apply ingenuity, mathematics, and scientific knowledge to develop _solutions_ \(e.g. materials, structures, _systems_\) for specific _problems_. They need consider _limitations_ from cost, practicality, regulation, and safety.
  - engineer / vs. scientist ::@:: The former builds things for _quality_ \(e.g. avoiding engineering failures\) while the latter builds things for discovering _new_ things \(e.g. scientific breakthroughs\).
- software engineering
  - software engineering / vs. computer scientist ::@:: The former studies practices and principles for building _quality_ systems while the latter studies _algorithms_ and _foundations_ of computing. <p> The former considers the _context_ to use the appropriate technologies \(e.g. frameworks\) according to their _characteristics_, while the latter focuses on _basic_ technologies, i.e. algorithms and foundations of computing.
  - software engineering / jobs ::@:: Coding or programming is only "programming-in-the-small". Software engineering is "programming-in-the-large", which includes communication, execution, etc.
    - software engineering / jobs / communication ::@:: communication, documentation, teamwork, translating user requirements, etc.
    - software engineering / jobs / execution ::@:: choose design alternatives, modeling \(at different abstraction levels\), use and apply, etc.
  - software engineering / characteristics ::@:: disciplined \(engineering principles\), multi-person, multi-version, problem solving \(solves real user problems\), quality \(e.g. economic, efficient, reliable, etc.\)
  - software engineering / activities ::@:: knowledge acquisition, modeling, problem solving, rationale management, etc.
    - software engineering / activities / modeling ::@:: Model user requirement. Model the system to be built.
    - software engineering / activities / problem solving ::@:: _Systematically_ \(but not _algorithmically_ as there are changes\) find an appropriate solution according to the user requirement. Note that user requirements can _change_ or be clarified over time.
    - software engineering / activities / knowledge acquisition ::@:: Knowledge about the problem needs to be learnt on the go. It may also need to be _unlearnt_ due to changing requirements or misunderstandings. You may even need to _start over_.
    - software engineering / activities / rationale management ::@:: As acquired knowledge, solutions \(new technologies\), user requirements _change_, we need to _revisit_ decisions and their rationale.

- [Unified Modeling Language](../../../../general/Unified%20Modeling%20Language.md) \(UML\) ::@:: It is a general-purpose, object-oriented, visual modeling language that provides a way to visualize the architecture and design of a system; like a blueprint. <p> It makes us think about the world in a certain way.
  - Unified Model Language / characteristics ::@:: current best practices, independent of software development methodology, industry standard \(especially for object-oriented systems, but can be used for non-OO systems as well\), visual modeling language
  - Unified Model Language / idea ::@:: A \(software\) system can modeled as a _collection_ of _collaborating_ objects.
  - Unified Model Language / building blocks ::@:: diagrams, relations, things, etc.

  - Unified Model Language / motivation ::@:: Models can describe the _essential_ details of reality only. This facilitates better communication \(e.g. ensure the system idea is the same\) among different stakeholders, e.g. clients, developers, etc. This also allows focusing on the _big picture_ without excess details \(e.g. programming-in-the-large, etc.\). <p> By reducing _complexity_, user requirements are better _understood_, architectures/designs are _cleaner_, and implementations are more _maintainable_.
  - Unified Model Language / object orientation ::@:: Many application domains can be modeled easily using _objects_. The _semantic gap_ is smaller. This is also how most people view reality.
  - Unified Model Language / abstraction levels ::@:: requirements: A _requirement model_ is constructed. Objects and their relations in the _application domain_ are identified. Their _implementation_ details are omitted. <br/> analysis, design: A _solution model_ is constructed. On top of the _requirement model_, _interface_ implementation details are considered, but no _internal_ implementation details. <br/> implementation: A _solution model_ is _implemented_. Even _internal_ implementation details are considered.

    - software development process / iterative and incremental / properties ::@:: incremental: Separate functions are implemented one-by-one. <br/> iterative: Each function is implemented and refined over time. <br/> both: Possible with various degrees.
- [waterfall model](../../../../general/waterfall%20model.md) ::@:: It is the process of performing the typical software development life cycle \(SDLC\) phases in sequential order. Each phase is completed before the next is started, and the result of each phase drives subsequent phases.
  - waterfall model / steps ::@:: gather requirements \(requirements specification document\) â†’ analysis & design \(design specification document\) â†’ implement \(modules\) â†’ test \(tested modules\) â†’ maintain <p> After each step except for the final step, comprehensive docs are created. Going back is _costly_, so you will want to check the docs for any errors before entering the next step.

- software development process
  - software development process / code and fix ::@:: Gather _requirements_ \(and usually store in the developer's mind only\). Based on the requirements, _implement_. _Test_ if it meets all requirements. If yes, you are done! If not, go back to implement to fix the errors.
    - software development process / code and fix / characteristics ::@:: changing requirements, many changes, messy code structure, unsuitable for large systems
    - software development process / code and fix / disadvantages ::@:: fail to meet expectations, over budget, over schedule, uncontrollable, unpredictable

  - software prototyping / comparison ::@:: Similar to code and fix, but there is slightly more discipline and incorporates user feedback.
  - software prototyping / characteristics ::@:: exploratory \(e.g. functionalities, user interfaces, etc.\), good for unknown or vague requirements
  - software prototyping / advantages ::@:: explore multiple different solutions, explore user requirements, incorporates user feedback
  - software prototyping / disadvantages ::@:: incomplete process \(engineering the final product may need a separate process\), invisible to management \(e.g. the number of prototypes needed\), missing or sparse docs
- [spiral model](../../../../general/spiral%20model.md) ::@:: It is a risk-driven software development process model. Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models, such as incremental, waterfall, or evolutionary prototyping.
  - spiral model / steps ::@:: plan â†’ risk analysis â†’ \(EITHER go OR no go\) â†’ engineer â†’ evaluate â†’ \(repeat until we have a complete system\)
  - spiral model / the spiral ::@:: The 4 quadrants of a 2D plane are respectively the 4 steps \(clockwise from quadrant II\), and the process is represented by arrowheads spiraling outwards.
  - spiral model / advantages ::@:: incorporates risk evaluation, incorporates user feedback to better meet expectations \(from evaluate and plan\), iterative and incremental
  - spiral model / disadvantages ::@:: expertise on risk evaluation required, for internal development rather than contract development as you know all the requirements, phases are not elaborated \(a separate process may be used\)
- [software release life cycle](../../../../general/software%20release%20life%20cycle)
  - software release life cycle / name ::@:: \(__this course__: use _phased release_\)
  - software release life cycle / motivation ::@:: Since change is inevitable \(by user requirements\), so produce releases over time and make changes accordingly.
  - software release life cycle / flow ::@:: Developers release multiple _development releases_ over time. _Concurrently_, users make _use/production releases_ out of each development release.
  - software release life cycle / incremental and iterative ::@:: Releases can be incremental or iterative or both. Often both are used in practice. <p> incremental: Separate functions of a system are implemented one-by-one \(partial system\). If used alone, each function is fully implemented at once \(full functionality\). <br/> iterative: Functions are implemented and refined over time \(partial functionality\). If used alone, all functions begin implementation at once \(full system\).
  - software release life cycle / advantages ::@:: apply appropriate expertise, early training, early user feedback, frequent releases, promote modularity, reduce risk
  - software release life cycle / disadvantages ::@:: common facilities for all functions are hard to identify, each function \(part\) needs to be small
- [agile software development](../../../../general/agile%20software%20development.md) ::@:: It is an umbrella term for approaches to developing software that reflect the values and principles agreed upon by _The Agile Alliance_, a group of 17 software practitioners, in 2001.
  - agile software development / principles ::@:: emphasized: client involvement, individuals and interactions, responsive to change, working software <br/> deemphasized \(but not completely ignored\): comprehensive docs, contract negotiation, plan following, processes and tools
  - agile software development / methods ::@:: continuous integration \(CI\), extreme programming \(XP\), scrum, etc.
  - agile software development / practices ::@:: pair programming: implement a feature with another person checking to reduce mistakes <br/> planning poker: estimate implementation time <br/> test-driven development \(TDD\): think of tests before implementing <br/> etc.
- [extreme programming](../../../../general/extreme%20programming.md) \(XP\) ::@:: It is a software development methodology intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent releases in short development cycles, intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.
  - extreme programming / steps ::@:: gather and analyze requirements â†’ implement â†’ \(repeat _quickly_\)
  - extreme programming / gather and analyze requirements ::@:: The developer determines features needed and estimate cost and time. Then the client selects features for each _iteration_.
  - extreme programming / implement ::@:: Each _iteration_ has many tasks. The developer implement features using _pair programming_ and design test cases using _TDD_.
- [continuous integration](../../../../general/continuous%20integration.md) \(CI\) ::@:: It is the practice of integrating source code changes frequently and ensuring that the integrated codebase is in a workable state.
  - continuous integration / mechanism ::@:: Typically, developers merge changes to an integration branch, and an automated system \(__this course__: CI server\) builds and tests the software system. Often, the automated process runs on each commit or runs on a schedule such as once a day. <p> \(__this course__: Work is submitted daily and/or as soon as possible to the main repository. Whenever that happens, CI servers run build and test scripts, and notify if there are failures.\)
  - continuous integration / advantages ::@:: automate build and test, catch build-breaking bugs early, check progress, integrate and test early, reduce integration conflicts
- [scrum](../../../../general/scrum.md) ::@:: It is an agile team collaboration framework commonly used in software development and other industries.
  - scrum / overview ::@:: It specifies what to do to develop a software product. But the detailed specifics \(how to do\) are decided by teams. <p> Requirements are items in a _product backlog_. The _product owner_ \(the client\) sets _priorities_. Then, the software is developed in _sprints_. Teams _self-organize_ to determine the best way to deliver the product.
  - scrum / sprint ::@:: Scrum prescribes for teams to break work into goals to be completed within time-boxed iterations, called _sprints_. Each sprint is no longer than one month and commonly lasts two weeks. The scrum team assesses progress in time-boxed, stand-up meetings of up to 15 minutes, called _daily scrums_. At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: one sprint review to demonstrate the work for stakeholders and solicit feedback, and one internal sprint retrospective.
    - scrum / sprint / activities ::@:: In a sprint, the software is designed, implemented, and tested. The requirements are not allowed to change.
  - scrum / release ::@:: A release should have 4 to 12 sprints. The shorter the release cycle, the shorter the duration of each sprint. <p> It may be associated with a _release backlog_.
  - scrum / framework ::@:: artifacts, meetings, roles
  - scrum / roles ::@:: product owner, scrum master, team
  - scrum / meetings ::@:: sprint planning â†’ daily scrum meeting â†’ sprint review \(external-oriented\), sprint retrospective \(internal-oriented\)
  - scrum / artifacts ::@:: burndown charts, product backlog, sprint backlog <br/> additional: defect backlog, release backlog
  - scrum / roles
    - scrum / roles / product owner ::@:: The key stakeholder represents the client or end users. It defines and prioritize requirements, and adjusts both every iteration. It decides on content and timing. It accepts or rejects results.
    - scrum / roles / scrum master ::@:: enable close cooperation, enact scrum values and practices, ensure functional and productive teams, remove progress obstacles, shield external interferences
    - scrum / roles / team ::@:: Apart from the scrum master, the other roles are similar to those in other development processes, e.g. developers, testers, etc.
  - scrum / meetings
    - scrum / meetings / sprint planning ::@:: Considers business conditions, current product, product backlog, team capacity, technology, etc. Prioritize product backlog to select _sprint goal_. Then, plan to achieve the sprint goal, and create a _sprint backlog_ from product backlog and estimate time \(ideally by subject matter experts\).
    - scrum / meetings / daily scrum meeting ::@:: They are stand-up \(no sitting down\) meetings up to 15 minutes. This is great for less experienced teams, but may hurt _morale_ in more experienced teams. Possible questions to ask: <p> review: What did you do yesterday? <br/> plan: What will you do today? <br/> obstacles: Is anything in your way?
  - scrum / artifacts
    - scrum / artifacts / product backlog ::@:: Requirements, which have values to the client or end users. Prioritized by the product owner and re-prioritized before each sprint. <p> This backlog may be further split into multiple _release backlogs_.
    - scrum / artifacts / sprint backlog ::@:: Selected items from the product backlog based on item priority and team capacity. Some product backlog items may become multiple sprint backlog items. During the sprint, team members select items to work on.
    - scrum / artifacts / burndown chart ::@:: For each task, we _estimate_ the hours remaining to complete it. Then, the chart sums them up and plot them as a line chart, which shows the _estimated_ total hours remaining to complete the sprint. <p> It may _fluctuate_, but should _tend to zero_, otherwise you have problems in your sprint. <p> The slope of the line chart is the _burndown velocity_.
    - scrum / artifacts / defect backlog ::@:: Try to avoid defects, but they are inevitable. When you encounter them, track them separately in this backlog to avoid mixing up items with the product or sprint backlog. The backlog may persists across sprints. Any defects related to a feature should be fixed before marking the feature as complete.
- agile software development
  - agile software development / advantages ::@:: adaptable/flexible to changing requirements, faster speed-to-market, fewer defects, immediate user feedback

    - unified process / cycle / transition ::@:: Deploy and maintain the system.
  - unified process / phase ::@:: It may be divided into a series of timeboxed _iterations_. Each iteration results in an _increment_, which is a release of the system that contains added or improved functionality compared with the previous release.
    - unified process / phase / iteration & increment ::@:: \(__this course__: Each iteration produces a _working product_. Each increment establishes a _system baseline_.\)
  - unified process / activities ::@:: The activities _vary_, but can usually be categorized into engineering activities and management activities

    - unified process / activities / management ::@:: for reference; \(engineering\) â†’ software quality assurance â†’ project management
  - unified process / diagram ::@:: The diagram charts phases and iterations on the _x_-axis \(time axis\), and activities on the _y_-axis \(dimension axis\). <p> For each activity, there is an area chart that varies over time \(and can be zero\), showing how the relative emphasis of different disciplines changes over the course of the project.
  - unified process / features ::@:: defines activities: workflows to transform user requirements to a system <br/> defines models: abstract or concrete entities that are transformed by workflows; e.g. artifacts <br/> generic: a generic process _framework_ needing to be _specialized_ to use
- software development process
  - software development process / considerations ::@:: people \(e.g. expertise, skills\), project \(e.g. novelty, size, vagueness\), organization \(e.g. accessibility, formality, size\)
