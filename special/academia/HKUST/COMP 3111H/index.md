- [software maintenance](../../../../general/software%20maintenance.md) ::@:: It is the modification of software after delivery. <p> It is often considered lower skilled and less rewarding than new development. As such, it is a common target for outsourcing or offshoring. <!--SR:!2025-11-30,54,310!2025-12-10,63,310-->
  - software maintenance / complexity ::@:: It can be complex. Indeed, given the large amount of existing software, it uses the most time of most developers. <!--SR:!2025-12-07,60,310!2025-12-04,58,310-->
- [programming complexity](../../../../general/programming%20complexity.md) ::@:: It is a term that includes software properties that affect internal interactions. <!--SR:!2025-12-07,60,310!2025-12-02,56,310-->

  - Ariane 5 / notable launches
    - Ariane 5 / notable launches / first test flight ::@:: Ariane 5's first test flight \(Ariane 5 Flight 501\) on 4 June 1996 failed, with the rocket self-destructing 37 seconds after launch because of a malfunction in the control software. <!--SR:!2025-11-19,45,290!2025-12-01,55,310-->
      - Ariane 5 / notable launches / first test flight / cause ::@:: A data conversion from 64-bit floating-point value to 16-bit signed integer value to be stored in a variable representing horizontal bias caused a processor trap \(operand error\) because the floating-point value was too large to be represented by a 16-bit signed integer. <!--SR:!2025-12-01,55,310!2025-11-22,45,290-->
- programming complexity

- [modular programming](../../../../general/modular%20programming.md) ::@:: It is a programming paradigm that emphasizes organizing the functions of a codebase into independent modules â€“ each providing an aspect of a computer program in its entirety without providing other aspects. <!--SR:!2025-12-06,59,310!2025-11-30,54,310-->
  - modular programming / motivation ::@:: Humans cannot understand things that are too _complex_. Often, we break down a complex systems into _modules_, parts of a system that makes sense to _consider separately_ and interact with other modules. This is known as _divide and conquer_. <!--SR:!2025-12-11,63,310!2025-11-16,40,290-->
  - modular programming / module ::@:: It is a part of a system that can be _considered separately_. To model _interactions_ with other modules, they are limited to _interfaces_, which _abstracts_ and _encapsulates_ a module via _information hiding_. <!--SR:!2025-12-09,61,310!2025-12-03,57,310-->
    - modular programming / module / abstraction ::@:: The internals of a module are hidden away. Interaction is defined via its interface only. The usage of the module by other modules can be understood by looking at its interface only \(ideally\). This reduces complexity of the system. <!--SR:!2025-12-04,58,310!2025-12-06,59,310-->
    - modular programming / module / encapsulation ::@:: When we want to modify a module, we only need to modify the module without changing other modules \(ideally\). The internals of a module can be changed without affecting other modules \(ideally\). This reduces maintenance burden. <!--SR:!2025-12-03,57,310!2025-12-07,60,310-->
  - modular programming / advantages ::@:: bug reduction, _incremental_ development, maintainability, productive teams, reusability <p> This makes software development _more predictable_, leading to better cost and time estimation. <!--SR:!2025-12-10,63,310!2025-12-14,66,310-->
- [engineer](../../../../general/engineer.md) ::@:: It is a practitioner of engineering. <p> They apply ingenuity, mathematics, and scientific knowledge to develop _solutions_ \(e.g. materials, structures, _systems_\) for specific _problems_. They need consider _limitations_ from cost, practicality, regulation, and safety. <!--SR:!2025-11-20,46,290!2025-12-07,60,310-->
  - engineer / vs. scientist ::@:: The former builds things for _quality_ \(e.g. avoiding engineering failures\) while the latter builds things for discovering _new_ things \(e.g. scientific breakthroughs\). <!--SR:!2025-12-12,64,310!2025-12-05,58,310-->
- software engineering
  - software engineering / vs. computer scientist ::@:: The former studies practices and principles for building _quality_ systems while the latter studies _algorithms_ and _foundations_ of computing. <p> The former considers the _context_ to use the appropriate technologies \(e.g. frameworks\) according to their _characteristics_, while the latter focuses on _basic_ technologies, i.e. algorithms and foundations of computing. <!--SR:!2025-12-03,57,310!2025-11-22,45,290-->
  - software engineering / jobs ::@:: Coding or programming is only "programming-in-the-small". Software engineering is "programming-in-the-large", which includes communication, execution, etc. <!--SR:!2025-12-06,59,310!2025-12-05,58,310-->
    - software engineering / jobs / communication ::@:: communication, documentation, teamwork, translating user requirements, etc. <!--SR:!2025-12-04,58,310!2025-12-08,61,310-->
    - software engineering / jobs / execution ::@:: choose design alternatives, modeling \(at different abstraction levels\), use and apply, etc. <!--SR:!2025-12-01,55,310!2025-12-13,65,310-->
  - software engineering / characteristics ::@:: disciplined \(engineering principles\), multi-person, multi-version, problem solving \(solves real user problems\), quality \(e.g. economic, efficient, reliable, etc.\) <!--SR:!2025-12-09,61,310!2025-11-15,39,290-->
  - software engineering / activities ::@:: knowledge acquisition, modeling, problem solving, rationale management, etc. <!--SR:!2025-12-12,64,310!2025-12-09,62,310-->
    - software engineering / activities / modeling ::@:: Model user requirement. Model the system to be built. <!--SR:!2025-12-09,62,310!2025-11-16,40,290-->
    - software engineering / activities / problem solving ::@:: _Systematically_ \(but not _algorithmically_ as there are changes\) find an appropriate solution according to the user requirement. Note that user requirements can _change_ or be clarified over time. <!--SR:!2025-12-13,65,310!2025-12-03,57,310-->
    - software engineering / activities / knowledge acquisition ::@:: Knowledge about the problem needs to be learnt on the go. It may also need to be _unlearnt_ due to changing requirements or misunderstandings. You may even need to _start over_. <!--SR:!2025-12-02,56,310!2025-12-02,56,310-->
    - software engineering / activities / rationale management ::@:: As acquired knowledge, solutions \(new technologies\), user requirements _change_, we need to _revisit_ decisions and their rationale. <!--SR:!2025-12-10,62,310!2025-12-08,61,310-->

## week 2 pre-lecture

- topic: modeling; unified modeling language; class diagram; association; aggregation; association class; generalization; UML summary
- [Unified Modeling Language](../../../../general/Unified%20Modeling%20Language.md) \(UML\) ::@:: It is a general-purpose, object-oriented, visual modeling language that provides a way to visualize the architecture and design of a system; like a blueprint. <p> It makes us think about the world in a certain way. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,331!2025-09-25,4,331-->
  - Unified Model Language / characteristics ::@:: current best practices, independent of software development methodology, industry standard \(especially for object-oriented systems, but can be used for non-OO systems as well\), visual modeling language <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,331-->
  - Unified Model Language / idea ::@:: A \(software\) system can modeled as a _collection_ of _collaborating_ objects. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,331!2025-09-25,4,323-->
  - Unified Model Language / building blocks ::@:: diagrams, relations, things, etc. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,323-->
  - Unified Model Language / mechanisms ::@:: adornments, division, extension, specification, etc. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,323!2025-09-25,4,338-->

  - Unified Model Language / motivation ::@:: Models can describe the _essential_ details of reality only. This facilitates better communication \(e.g. ensure the system idea is the same\) among different stakeholders, e.g. clients, developers, etc. This also allows focusing on the _big picture_ without excess details \(e.g. programming-in-the-large, etc.\). By reducing _complexity_, user requirements are better _understood_, architectures/designs are _cleaner_, and implementations are more _maintainable_. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,323-->
  - Unified Model Language / object orientation ::@:: Many application domains can be modeled easily using _objects_. The _semantic gap_ is smaller. This is also how most people view reality. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,331!2025-09-25,4,338-->
  - Unified Model Language / abstraction levels ::@:: requirements: A _requirement model_ is constructed. Objects and their relations in the _application domain_ are identified. Their _implementation_ details are omitted. <br/> analysis, design: A _solution model_ is constructed. On top of the _requirement model_, _interface_ implementation details are considered, but no _internal_ implementation details. <br/> implementation: A _solution model_ is _implemented_. Even _internal_ implementation details are considered. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,331-->

    - scrum / artifacts / product backlog ::@:: Requirements, which have values to the client or end users. Prioritized by the product owner and re-prioritized before each sprint. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,323!2025-09-25,4,323-->
    - scrum / artifacts / spring backlog ::@:: Selected items from the product backlog based on item priority and team capacity. Some product backlog items may become multiple spring backlog items. During the spring, team members select items to work on. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,338-->
    - scrum / artifacts / burndown chart ::@:: For each task, we _estimate_ the hours remaining to complete it. Then, the chart sums them up and plot them as a line chart, which shows the _estimated_ total hours remaining to complete the sprint. <p> It may _fluctuate_, but should _tend to zero_, otherwise you have problems in your sprint. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,331-->

- software development process
  - software development process / characteristics ::@:: abstraction or generality \(of process\), adaptable to changes, discipline \(formal, rigor\), incremental, risk assessment, separation of concerns \(modularity\) <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,331-->
  - software development process / discipline ::@:: spiral: The 4 phases must be followed in a spiral without backtracking. <br/> waterfall: SDLC is followed sequentially without possibility of backtracking. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,331!2025-09-25,4,338-->
  - software development process / separation of concerns ::@:: phased release: Development and release is separate. <br/> spiral: Planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation are separate. <br/> waterfall: Each phase of SDLC is separate. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,331-->
  - software development process / abstraction or generality ::@:: spiral: Allows using other processes for the actual development and testing. <br/> waterfall: As a direct implementation of the general SDLC. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,323!2025-09-25,4,338-->
  - software development process / adaptable to changes ::@:: agile: By its nature. <br/> phased release: Releases happen over time. <br/> spiral: Planning happens periodically. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,331!2025-09-25,4,331-->
  - software development process / incremental ::@:: agile: Many sprints are needed. <br/> phased release: Many releases are needed. <br/> prototyping: Many prototypes are needed. <br/> spiral: Many spirals are needed. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,331!2025-09-25,4,331-->
  - software development process / risk assessment ::@:: spiral: The only process to explicitly integrate risk analysis. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,331-->
- [unified process](../../../../general/unified%20process.md) ::@:: It is an iterative and incremental software development process framework. <p> It is not simply a process, but rather an extensible framework which should be customized for specific organizations or projects. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,331-->
  - unified process / cycle ::@:: inception â†’ elaboration â†’ construction â†’ transition <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,331!2025-09-25,4,331-->
  - unified process / phase ::@:: It may be divided into a series of timeboxed _iterations_. Each iteration results in an _increment_, which is a release of the system that contains added or improved functionality compared with the previous release. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,331!2025-09-25,4,331-->
    - unified process / phase / iteration & increment ::@:: \(__this course__: Each iteration produces a _working product_. Each increment establishes a _system baseline_.\) <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,323-->
  - unified process / activities ::@:: The activities _vary_, but can usually be categorized into engineering activities and management activities <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,338-->
    - unified process / activities / engineering ::@:: for reference; requirements capture â†’ analysis â†’ design â†’ implement â†’ test â†’ \(management\) <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,338-->
    - unified process / activities / management ::@:: for reference; \(engineering\) â†’ software quality assurance â†’ project management <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,338-->
  - unified process / diagram ::@:: The diagram charts phases and iterations on the _x_-axis \(time axis\), and activities on the _y_-axis \(dimension axis\). <p> For each activity, there is an area chart that varies over time \(and can be zero\), showing how the relative emphasis of different disciplines changes over the course of the project. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,338-->
  - unified process / features ::@:: defines activities: workflows to transform user requirements to a system <br/> defines models abstract or concrete entities that are transformed by workflows; e.g. artifacts <br/> generic: a generic process _framework_ needing to be _specialized_ to use <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,331-->
- software development process
  - software development process / considerations ::@:: people \(e.g. expertise, skills\), project \(e.g. novelty, size, vagueness\), organization \(e.g. accessibility, formality, size\) <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,338!2025-09-25,4,331-->
- unified process
  - unified process / advantages ::@:: It incorporates _best practices_ from all the previous software development processes and provides a _generic framework_. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,4,323!2025-09-25,4,338-->
