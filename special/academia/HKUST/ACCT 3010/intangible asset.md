__Intangible assets__ are identifiable non‑monetary assets that lack physical substance. They are usually classified as non‑current and are recorded on the balance sheet at cost, which includes all acquisition costs necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use. Typical examples include trademarks, patents, customer lists, copyrights, licenses and goodwill.

## characteristics

Intangible assets are _identifiable_, have no physical form, and are not monetary items. They are normally listed as non‑current assets on a company’s balance sheet. Six broad categories of intangibles exist: marketing-related, customer-related, artistic-related, contract-related, technology-related, and goodwill.

1. _Marketing‑related_ ::@:: – trademarks, trade names, domain names, and non‑competition agreements. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
2. _Customer‑related_ ::@:: – customer lists, backlogs, and contractual or non‑contractual customer relationships. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
3. _Artistic‑related_ ::@:: – plays, literary works, photographs, movies and related copyrights. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
4. _Contract‑related_ ::@:: – franchises, licensing agreements, broadcast rights and service contracts. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
5. _Technology‑related_ ::@:: – patents, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
6. _Goodwill_ ::@:: – the excess of purchase price over identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

## valuation

When an intangible is purchased, it is recorded at _cost_, which includes the purchase price plus any legal fees or incidental expenses required to make the asset ready for use, including purchase price, legal fees, and other incidental expenses.

For internally created intangibles, research‑phase costs are expensed as incurred, while development costs may be capitalised once economic viability criteria—such as demonstrable feasibility and expected future cash flows—are met.  IFRS requires specific thresholds before capitalization.

_Example._ Microsoft capitalises internal‑use software after technological feasibility is achieved and amortises it over an estimated useful life of 3–5 years, while expensing the remainder of research costs immediately.

## amortization

Intangibles with a finite useful life are amortised systematically over that period. The amortisation charge should reflect how the asset’s benefits are consumed or used up. Typically, straight-line amortization is used, which is calculated as: $$\text{Amortisation Expense} = \frac{\text{Cost – Residual Value} }{\text{Useful Life} }$$ The expense is debited to _Amortisation Expense_ and credited either directly to the intangible asset or to an accumulated‑amortisation contra account. (annotation: __this course__: Credit to the intangible asset directly.) Even if limited-life intangibles are amortized, like indefinite-life intangibles must also be tested for impairment at least annually: test if _recoverable amount_, which is the _higher of_ fair value less costs to sell and value‑in‑use, is less than carrying value, and if so, impair the asset book value such that it matches the recoverable amount.

Indefinite‑life intangibles are not amortised but must be tested for impairment at least annually: test if _recoverable amount_, which is the _higher of_ fair value less costs to sell and value‑in‑use, is less than carrying value, and if so, impair the asset book value such that it matches the recoverable amount.

> [!example] __license example__
>
> The company purchases a gene‑product license for \$1 000 000 and amortises it in the pattern of use: 30 % first year, 20 % second year, then 10 % each subsequent year.
>
> $$\begin{aligned} \text{First‑year expense} & = \$1\,000\,000 \times 0.30 = \$300\,000 \\ \text{Second‑year expense} & = \$1\,000\,000 \times 0.20 = \$200\,000 \end{aligned}$$

## types

Intangible assets are divided into six major categories, each governed by distinct accounting rules concerning recognition, measurement, and subsequent treatment: marketing-related, customer-related, artistic-related, contract-related, technology-related, and goodwill.

### marketing-related

Marketing‑related intangibles include trademarks, trade names, domain names, newspaper mastheads, and non‑competition agreements. They are typically _capitalised_ at purchase price; if the asset has an indefinite life, it is _not_ amortised but must be tested for impairment each year.

> ![example] __trademark example__  
>
> A company acquired a trademark for \$3 000 000, and renewable at a minor cost every 5 years, that will help distinguish one of its consumer products. Because internal studies indicate the trademark will generate cash flows indefinitely, even if the renewal requires a minor cost, it is treated as an indefinite‑life asset. The journal entry at acquisition is  
>
> ```text
> Trademarks          3,000,000
>    Cash                        3,000,000
> ```
>
> The renewal fee is a periodic operating expense that does not extend the useful life of the trademark. It only _maintains_ expected benefits rather than adding new benefits. It should be recorded as an expense when paid:
>
> ```text
> Trademark Renewal Expense   x,xxx
>     Cash                               x,xxx
> ```
>
> The cost does _not_ increase the carrying amount of the intangible asset.

### customer-related

Customer‑related intangibles comprise customer lists, order or production backlogs, and contractual or non‑contractual customer relationships. They are capitalised at cost and amortised over their useful life using a straight‑line method unless the useful life is indefinite.

> [!example] __customer list example__
>
> A company purchases a newspaper’s customer list for €6 000 000 on 1 January 2025, expecting to benefit evenly over three years. The purchase entry is  
>
> ```text
> Customer List        6,000,000
>    Cash                        6,000,000
> ```
>
> Amortisation at year‑end is calculated as $$\text{Amortisation Expense} = \frac{\$6\,000\,000}{3}=2\,000\,000,$$ and the entry for each of the three years is  
>
> ```text
> Amortization Expense   2,000,000
>    Customer List              2,000,000
> ```

### artistic-related

Artistic‑related intangibles cover plays, literary works, musical compositions, photographs, and audiovisual material. The legal life (e.g., copyright duration) often exceeds the useful life; therefore, amortisation is applied over the shorter period.

> [!example] __copyright example__
>
> A company purchases a copyright for \$500 000 with a 40‑year legal life but estimates a useful life of 25 years. The journal entry is  
>
> ```text
> Copyrights          500,000
>    Cash                        500,000
> ```
>
> The asset is amortised over 25 years; impairment testing applies if recoverability issues arise.

### contract‑related

Contracts such as franchise agreements, licensing arrangements, broadcast rights, and supply contracts fall into this category. If the contract has a definite finite life, it is amortised over that period; otherwise, it is carried at cost with no amortisation but requires annual impairment testing.

> [!example] __license example__
>
> WWKL acquires an 8‑year FCC licence for \$400 000, renewable indefinitely at minimal cost. The purchase entry is  
>
> ```text
> Licenses            400,000
>    Cash                        400,000
> ```
>
> Because the license can be renewed indefinitely and is expected to generate ongoing cash flows, it is treated as an indefinite‑life asset and is not amortised; an annual fair‑value test is performed.
>
> No amortisation is recorded, because it only _maintains_ expected benefits rather than adding new benefits; instead, the company performs a yearly fair‑value impairment test. Each renewal payment is also a periodical operating expense:
>
> ```text
> License Renewal Expense   y,yyy
>     Cash                               y,yyy
> ```
>
> Again, the renewal fee does not alter the carrying value of the license; it is expensed as incurred.

### technology‑related

Technology‑related intangibles include patents, trade secrets, and other proprietary technology. Costs of acquiring a patent are capitalised; research costs are expensed immediately, while development costs may be capitalised once economic viability criteria are met. Amortisation runs over the legal life or useful life, whichever is shorter.

[!example] __patent example__
>
> A company incurs \$180 000 in legal fees on 1 January 2025 to secure a patent whose useful life is 10 years. The entries are  
>
> ```text
> Patents              180,000
>    Cash                        180,000
> ```
>
> and at year‑end: $$\text{Amortisation Expense} = \frac{\$180\,000}{10}=18\,000,$$
>
> ```text
> Patent Amortisation Expense   18,000
>    Patents                       18,000
> ```

### goodwill

_Goodwill_ represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised. It is recorded only when an entire business is purchased and measured as the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets (assets less liabilities) acquired. Internally created goodwill should not be capitalised.

The goodwill calculation follows the formula above: purchase price minus fair‑value net identifiable assets. The resulting goodwill is treated as an indefinite‑life asset; it is not amortised but must be tested for impairment annually.

> [!example] __recording goodwill__
>
> Company A purchased Company B for \$400,000. The fair values of Company B's net identifiable assets amounted to \$350,000, and its current liabilities have a fair value of \$55,000. Calculate goodwill: $$\text{Goodwill}= \$400\,000-\$350\,000=\boxed{\$50\,000}$$
>
> Company A recorded the transaction as:
>
> ```text
> Property, Plant & Equipment  205 000
> Patents                       18 000
> Inventory                    122 000
> Accounts Receivable           35 000
> Cash                          25 000
> Goodwill                      50 000
>     Cash                              400 000
>     Liabilities                        55 000
> ```

_Goodwill write‑off_ occurs when impairment indicators are present; the carrying amount is reduced to recoverable value.  A _bargain purchase_ arises when the purchase price is less than the fair value of net assets acquired, creating a gain for the purchaser.

> [!example] __bargain purchase__
>
> Company B's assets and liabilities had a fair value of \$900 000 and \$100 000 respectively. Company A bought the business for \$500 000.
>
> For _balance sheet_, report assets and liabilities at fair value. For _income statement_, record a gain (under _other revenues and gains_, which is part of _continuing operations_) on acquisition of $$(\$900\,000-\$100\,000)-\$500\,000=\boxed{\$300\,000} \,.$$ Journal entry:
>
> ```text
> Assets                   900 000
>     Liabilities                   100 000
>     Cash                          500 000
>     Gain on Acquisition           300 000
> ```

#### goodwill in practice

Goodwill remains a significant driver of book equity for many large firms; cumulative write‑offs across major U.S. and European companies have exceeded \$1.1 trillion in recent years.

> [!example] __Lehman Brothers North American (2008)__
>
> Barclays acquired the distressed operations for a total consideration of \$874 m, while fair‑value net assets were \$3 299 m. The resulting gain was: $$\text{gain on acquisition}=\boxed{\$2\,262\,\text{m} }$$ This one‑time boost reflected fire‑sale pricing amid bankruptcy.

---

> [!example] __AOL–Time Warner (2001)__
>
> AOL paid approximately \$147 billion, of which \$127 billion became goodwill. Subsequent impairments in 2002 reduced goodwill to about \$28 billion and eventually to near zero by 2005. The initial goodwill was: $\boxed{\$127\,\text{bn} }$ and the subsequent write‑downs illustrate the volatility of goodwill on long‑term balances.

---

> [!example] __Meta (Facebook) – WhatsApp (2014)__
>
> Meta acquired WhatsApp for \$19 billion (\$4 billion cash, \$12 billion equity, \$3 billion deferred cash), while WhatsApp's identifiable net assets acquired was \$1.2 billion. Goodwill was: $$\$19\,\text{bn}-\$1.2\,\text{bn}=\boxed{\$17.8\,\text{bn} }$$ which at the time represented a large portion of the purchase price. In 2022 Meta recognised a \$27 bn goodwill impairment for the WhatsApp‑Messenger unit, reducing its book value to zero and impacting market capitalisation by over \$200 bn.

## impairment  

Intangible assets are impaired when the amount recoverable from them falls below their carrying amounts.  The recovery can come either from continued use or from a sale.  Companies test goodwill at least annually and other indefinite‑life intangibles once a year; limited‑life intangibles are tested as part of the normal impairment review for property, plant and equipment.

### impairment of limited‑life intangible assets  

The rules that govern impairments of property, plant and equipment also apply to limited‑life intangibles.  The impairment loss equals the carrying amount minus the recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is either _fair value less costs to sell_ or _value‑in‑use_: $$\text{Impairment Loss}=\text{Carrying Amount}-\text{Recoverable Amount} \,.$$ _Fair value less costs to sell_ refers to what the asset could be sold for after deducting costs of disposal. _Value-in-use_ refers to the present value of cash flows expected from future use, including cash flows from its sale or disposal.

> [!example] __patent impairment__
>
> An oil company held a shale‑oil extraction patent with a carrying value of €5,000,000 at the end of 2024.  A decline in demand made the patent impaired; its recoverable amount was estimated by discounting expected future cash flows to €2,000,000.  $$\text{Impairment Loss}=€5\,000\,000-€2\,000\,000=€3\,000\,000$$
>
> The journal entry is:
>
> ```text
> Loss on Impairment          3 000 000
>     Patents                         3 000 000
> ```
>
> After the loss, the patent’s carrying amount becomes €2,000,000 and it is amortised over its remaining useful life or legal life, whichever is shorter.

If conditions improve, a company may reverse part of an earlier impairment.  Goodwill reversals are not permitted.

> [!example] __reversal of impairment__
>
> For the oil, in early 2026 the recoverable amount rose to €1,750,000.  The reversal entry was:
>
> ```text
> Patents               150 000
>     Recovery of Impairment Loss     150 000
> ```
>
> The reversal is reported as _Other income and expense_; goodwill reversals are not permitted.

#### impairment of indefinite-life intangibles other than goodwill  

These assets must be tested for impairment at least annually, using the same recoverable‑amount approach as limited‑life intangibles.  The recoverable amount may be based on _fair value less costs to sell_ if no active market exists.

> [!example] __broadcast license impairment__
>
> A radio company bought a broadcast licence for €2,000,000 and treated it as indefinite life because it could be renewed every ten years.  After the regulatory body decided to auction licences, the company estimated the recoverable amount at €1,500,000.  $$\text{Impairment Loss}=€2\,000\,000-€1\,500\,000=€500\,000 \,.$$ This loss is recorded in the same manner as for other intangibles.

#### impairment of goodwill

Goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually and the test is performed on each cash‑generating unit (CGU).  The recoverable amount is normally a _value‑in‑use_ estimate.  Unlike other intangibles, goodwill impairments are never reversed.

> [!example] __goodwill impairment__
>
> Company A purchased a division of Company B for €2 million four years ago and recorded €900,000 of goodwill.  After operating losses, the division’s recoverable amount fell to €1,900,000 while its carrying amount (including goodwill) was €2,400,000.  $$\text{Impairment Loss}=€2\,400\,000-€1\,900\,000=€500\,000$$
>
> The journal entry is:
>
> ```text
> Loss on Impairment          500 000
>     Goodwill                        500 000
> ```
>
> After the entry, goodwill remains at €400,000.

## presentation

The reporting of intangible assets follows the same framework used for property, plant and equipment.  The income statement shows amortisation expense and any impairment losses, while the balance sheet lists goodwill separately from other intangibles.

The reporting of intangible assets follows the same framework used for property, plant and equipment.  The income statement presents _amortisation expense_ and _impairment loss_: amortisation is shown within operating expenses (often grouped with depreciation), impairment losses, reported net of _impairment reversals_, appear as a separate line under operating income and expenses or in the “Other operating income and expenses”. This also implies impairment reversals cannot exceed impairment losses.

For research and development (R&D), Companies disclose the total amount of R&D expense charged in each period, which is charged to _operating expenses_ in the same period. A _note_ is added to indicate how R&D  costs are charged or capitalized, e.g. capitalised when regulatory approval is considered highly probable, typically at the point of filing with a major market regulator.

## research and development recognition  

Research and development (R&D) expenditures are not recognised as intangible assets in themselves; however, they frequently give rise to patents or copyrights that can provide future economic benefit.  Companies therefore must decide whether to expense R&D costs immediately or to capitalise them when the project becomes economically viable.

The basic rules are research costs are expensed as incurred; development costs may be expensed or capitalised depending on whether the project has reached a stage where its benefits are expected to flow to the company. That is, capitalisation begins once the project is sufficiently advanced that future economic benefits are probable, i.e. the project is economically viable.

_Research activities_ involve original investigation aimed at gaining new scientific or technical knowledge.  _Development activities_ apply research findings to design a product, process, system or service before commercial production starts.  For instance, laboratory work seeking new knowledge represents research, whereas building prototypes and running pilot plants constitutes development.

### research and development examples

These examples illustrate when R&D outlays are expensed versus capitalised, and the rationale for each accounting decision.

- _Prototype laser‑scanner material, labour and overhead_ (project not yet viable) :@: Expense immediately as R&D. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Testing and design‑modification costs for the prototype_ (not yet viable) :@: Expense immediately as R&D. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Legal fees to obtain a patent on the new scanner_ :@: Capitalize the patent; amortise it to overhead as part of cost of goods manufactured. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Executive salaries_ :@: Record as operating expense, as part of general and administrative expenses. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Marketing‑research costs for promoting the new scanner_ :@: Expense as an operating expense, as part of selling expenses. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Engineering costs that advance the scanner to full production (project now viable)_ :@: Capitalize these costs as R&D assets. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Costs to defend the patent_ :@: Record as legal‑fee expenses (treated as operating cost), as it only _maintains_ expected benefits rather than adding new benefits. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Commissions paid to sales staff for marketing the new scanner_ :@: Expense as an operating expense, as part of selling expenses. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Long‑range research facility_ :@: – Constructed for current and future projects; capitalise and depreciate as R&D expense because it has alternative future use. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _R&D equipment used only on the current project_ :@: – Expense immediately as R&D (research cost). <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Machinery usable in present and future R&D projects_ :@: – Capitalise and depreciate as R&D expense; alternative future use justifies capitalization. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Materials for current and future R&D_ :@: – Record as inventory, allocate to R&D as consumed; alternative future use warrants this treatment. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Salaries of research staff designing a new laser scanner_ :@: – Expense immediately as R&D (research cost). <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Research costs incurred under contract with another company_ :@: – Recorded as a receivable; not an R&D expense because the cost is reimbursable and does not meet recognition criteria. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270-->

Certain other costs are treated like R&D for accounting purposes, though they are charged to separate accounts.  Start‑up costs for a new operation, initial operating losses and advertising expenses are expensed as incurred because they do not meet the criteria for recognising an intangible asset.
