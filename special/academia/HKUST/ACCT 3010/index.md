- topic: environment framework; conceptual framework; financial reporting
- [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) ::@:: It is a branch of accounting concerned with the summary, analysis and reporting of financial transactions related to a business. <!--SR:!2026-01-11,80,350!2026-01-17,85,350-->
  - financial accounting / environment ::@:: Accounting produces financial statements for financial reporting purposes. They are used by stakeholders to allocate capital. High-quality standards are needed to standardize accounting practices and financial statements, so that stakeholders can be well-informed. <!--SR:!2025-12-05,49,330!2025-12-16,58,330-->
  - financial reporting / organizations ::@:: International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\): the independent accounting standard-setting body of the IFRS Foundation <br/> International Organization of Securities Commissions \(IOSCO\): an association of organizations that regulate the world's securities and futures markets <!--SR:!2026-01-17,85,350!2026-01-06,76,350-->
  - financial reporting / conceptual framework ::@:: A conceptual framework is needed for accounting to standardize accounting practices and financial statements. One such framework is International Financial Reporting Standards \(IFRS\). It has been developed \(and continuously developed to handle new environments\) over a long time. We should be aware of its overview, its objectives, e.g. elements of financial statements, qualitative characteristics of accounting information, etc. <!--SR:!2025-12-08,51,330!2026-01-17,85,350-->
  - financial reporting / assumptions and principles ::@:: There are many assumptions and principles in accounting, e.g. cost constraint. <!--SR:!2026-01-17,85,350!2026-01-17,85,350-->
  - financial reporting / challenges ::@:: convergence of standards, ethics, expectation gap, financial reporting issues, politics, etc. <!--SR:!2026-01-11,80,350!2026-01-17,85,350-->
- [International Financial Reporting Standards](../../../../general/International%20Financial%20Reporting%20Standards.md) \(IFRS\) ::@:: They are accounting standards issued by the IFRS Foundation and the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\). They constitute a standardised way of describing the company's financial performance and position so that company financial statements are understandable and comparable across international boundaries. They are particularly relevant for companies with shares or securities publicly listed. <!--SR:!2025-12-07,50,330!2026-01-06,76,350-->
  - International Financial Reporting Standards / convergence ::@:: IFRS have replaced many different national accounting standards around the world but have not replaced the separate accounting standards in the United States where US GAAP is applied. <p> Most jurisdictions requires IFRS for most or all companies. A few jurisdictions permits IFRS \(and allows other formats\). Only a few jurisdictions have their own national standards, some of which are converging to IFRS. <!--SR:!2025-12-08,51,330!2025-11-14,31,310-->
  - International Financial Reporting Standards / motivation ::@:: Economics around the world are increasingly intertwined under _globalization_. Even Donald Trump's recent policies do not stop it \(as seen from Frankel index, trade volume, etc.\) <p> Many national exchanges list a significant foreign companies, making up a significant portion of market capitalization, e.g. Chinese stocks in the United States. <!--SR:!2025-12-27,60,352!2026-01-26,90,372-->
    - International Financial Reporting Standards / motivation / foreign exchanges ::@:: By listing on foreign exchanges, companies can raise more international funds rather than from domestic ones only. Foreign investors have more choices for investments. For example, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. went public \(IPO\) on the New York Stock Exchange \(NYSE\) in 2014. Later, it had a secondary on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange \(HKEX\) on 2019-11. <!--SR:!2025-11-20,36,310!2026-02-14,99,310-->
- [capital market](../../../../general/capital%20market.md) ::@:: It is a financial market in which long-term debt \(over a year\) or equity-backed securities are bought and sold, in contrast to a money market where short-term debt is bought and sold. <!--SR:!2026-01-17,85,350!2026-01-06,76,350-->
  - capital market / financial and information flows ::@:: _Capital flows_ from households and investors to firms _via_ financial regulators, institutions, or intermediaries. <p> _Information_ flows from firms to households and investors _via_ accounting regulators, auditors, or information intermediaries. <p> The financial intermediaries and information intermediaries _exchange_ capital and information with each other. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,25,310!2025-12-08,51,330-->
- financial reporting
  - financial reporting / importance ::@:: Many economics depressions are linked to poor quality accounting information, e.g. the Great Depression \(1929–39\), savings and loans crisis \(1980s–early 90s\), Asian financial crisis \(1997–98\), dot-com bubble \(2000–02\), global financial crisis \(2007–09\), etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,25,310!2026-01-11,80,350-->
  - financial reporting / essential characteristics ::@:: _Identify_, _measure_, and _communicate_ financial information of economic entities to interested parties. Users can then _allocate_ capital _efficiently_, ensuring capital markets are efficient. <!--SR:!2025-12-08,51,330!2025-11-19,33,310-->

  - financial accounting / conceptual framework
- [IFRS 16](../../../../general/IFRS%2016.md) ::@:: It is an International Financial Reporting Standard \(IFRS\) promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\) providing guidance on accounting for leases. <!--SR:!2026-01-24,84,374!2026-02-05,94,386-->
  - IFRS 16 / history ::@:: It was issued in January 2016 and is effective for most companies that report under IFRS since 1 January 2019. Upon becoming effective, it replaced the earlier leasing standard, IAS 17. <!--SR:!2026-02-02,92,386!2026-02-01,91,386-->
  - IFRS 16 / lessees ::@:: It has a substantial impact on the financial statements of lessees of property and equipment – requiring that leases be placed on-balance sheet by recognising a 'right-of-use' asset and a lease liability. <!--SR:!2026-02-08,97,386!2026-02-13,101,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / lessees / pre-IFRS 16 ::@:: Lease payments were treated purely as operating expenses with no balance‑sheet impact. <!--SR:!2026-01-24,84,374!2026-02-04,93,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / lessees / under IFRS 16 ::@:: Lease payments must be placed on-balance sheet by recognizing a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,90,386!2026-01-31,90,386-->
  - IFRS 16 / lessors ::@:: It substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases. <!--SR:!2026-02-03,93,386!2026-02-08,97,386-->
  - IFRS 16 / example ::@:: Delta Airlines is one of the world's largest airlines and leases most of its fleet. <p> Prior to IFRS 16 \(IAS 17\) these leases were classified largely as operating leases—the lease payments appeared only on the income statement, with no corresponding asset or liability on the balance sheet. <p> The transition to IFRS 16 \(effective 2019\) required almost all lessees to recognize a right‑of‑use \(ROU\) asset and an associated lease liability for every lease that has a term of more than 12 months, unless it is a short‑term lease or a low‑value asset. <!--SR:!2026-02-12,100,386!2026-02-12,100,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / lease terms ::@:: - Duration: 5 years <br/> - Annual lease payment: \$10 million → total cash outflow of \$50 million over the lease life. <br/> - Discount rate \(Delta's incremental borrowing rate\): 5% <p> Using a 5% discount factor for a 5‑year annuity, the present value \(PV\) of future payments is __\$43.3 million__. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,102,386!2026-02-12,100,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / pre-IFRS 16 treatment ::@:: - Each year, $10 million was recorded as an operating lease expense on the income statement. <br/> - No asset or liability appeared on the balance sheet; the aircraft remained a _fixed asset_ \(purchased or financed separately\). <br/> - Cash‑flow impact: Operating cash outflows of $10 million each year. <!--SR:!2026-01-03,63,354!2026-02-05,94,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / lease liability treatment ::@:: Use the _effective‑interest_ amortization method. <p> - Recognized at PV = \$43.3 million. <br/> - The liability is reduced over time by the principal portion of lease payments; interest expense is recognized on the remaining balance. <br/> - Year‑1 interest: 5% × \$43.3 million = __\$2.165 million__. <br/> - Principal payment in year 1 = \$10 million – \$2.165 million = __\$7.835 million__, reducing the liability to \$35.465 million for year 2. <!--SR:!2026-02-01,91,386!2026-01-12,70,366-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / right-of-use asset treatment ::@:: - Also recognized at \$43.3 million \(net of any lease incentives or initial direct costs\). <br/> - Amortized \("depreciation" but for intangible assets\) on a straight‑line basis \(other amortization methods may be used\) over the lease term: \$43.3 million ÷ 5 = __\$8.66 million per year__. <!--SR:!2026-02-03,93,386!2026-02-02,92,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / income statement impact ::@:: - Depreciation/amortization of ROU asset: \$8.66 million. <br/> - Interest expense on liability: \$2.165 million \(decreasing each subsequent year\). <br/> - Total lease cost in year 1: \$10.825 million, slightly higher than the pre‑IFRS 16 operating expense due to the inclusion of interest. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,90,386!2026-02-01,91,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / cash flow statement impact ::@:: - Cash outflow remains \$10 million. <br/> - The principal portion \(\$7.835 million\) is reclassified from operating to financing activity; the interest component \(\$2.165 million\) stays in operating activities \(consistent with IAS 8 guidance on lease classification\). <!--SR:!2026-02-01,91,386!2026-02-02,92,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / balance sheet impact ::@:: - Increase in total assets by \$43.3 million \(ROU asset\). <br/> - Increase in total liabilities by \$43.3 million \(lease liability\), netting to zero change in equity directly from the lease. <!--SR:!2026-01-09,68,366!2026-02-04,93,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / Delta Airlines ::@:: Right‑of‑use assets totaled \$25.9 billion with lease liabilities of \$24.8 billion; annual payments averaged \$4.5 billion over 5–15 year terms at a weighted‑average discount rate of 4.5%. <!--SR:!2026-02-15,103,386!2026-02-12,100,386-->
  - IFRS 16 / implementation steps ::@:: identify leases → recognize leases → amortize leases <!--SR:!2026-02-01,91,386!2025-12-26,59,366-->
    - IFRS 16 / implementation steps / identify leases ::@:: Identify all leases with terms &gt;12 months. <!--SR:!2026-01-26,86,374!2026-02-03,93,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / implementation steps / recognize leases ::@:: Compute PV of lease payments using the incremental borrowing rate or lessee's discount rate if it is more reflective of market conditions. Recognize ROU asset and liability at that PV; adjust for any lease incentives, initial direct costs, or residual value guarantees. \(There are several cases for adjustment, which will not be mentioned here.\) <!--SR:!2026-02-12,100,386!2026-02-13,101,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / implementation steps / amortize leases ::@:: Allocate depreciation/amortization over the lease term \(or shorter useful life if the asset's useful life is shorter\). Record interest expense on the lease liability using the effective‑interest method each reporting period. <!--SR:!2026-01-03,63,354!2026-02-01,91,386-->
- [IFRS 2](../../../../general/IFRS%202.md) ::@:: It is an international financial reporting standard issued in February 2004 by the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\) to provide guidance on the accounting for share based payments. <p> Its purpose is to reflect the cost of awarding equity or equity based incentives to employees or other parties in exchange for goods or services. <!--SR:!2026-01-21,81,374!2026-02-13,101,386-->
  - IFRS 2 / pre-IFRS 2 ::@:: Prior to IFRS 2, ESOs were disclosed but not expensed, masking significant compensation costs. <!--SR:!2026-01-26,86,374!2026-02-07,96,386-->
  - IFRS 2 / example ::@:: Amazon recorded \$19.6 billion in stock‑based compensation expense \(employee stock options \(ESOs\), restricted stock units \(RSUs\)\), valuing each option at a fair value of \$150 \(Black–Scholes model: volatility 30%, risk‑free rate 3%, term 5 years\). <p> The requirement to recognize outflows of economic benefits and measure them at fair value ensures that the true cost of ESOs \(e.g. Amazon's net income reduced by 10–15% post-expensing\) is reflected in net income, ensuring relevance for investors and comparability across firms. <!--SR:!2026-02-15,103,386!2026-01-03,63,354-->
- financial accounting
  - financial accounting / conceptual framework
    - financial accounting / conceptual framework / examples ::@:: A \$1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 prize with 10&nbsp;000 tickets sold \(\$100 each\); secondary market price per ticket is \$90. A donor's \(who pays more than the issue price\) purchase of one ticket for \$150 raises questions about appropriate measurement—whether to record at issue price \(\$100\), fair value \(\$90\), or some other basis. <!--SR:!2026-02-09,98,386!2026-02-04,93,386-->
- [IFRS 9](../../../../general/IFRS%209.md) ::@:: It is an International Financial Reporting Standard \(IFRS\) published by the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\). It addresses the accounting for financial instruments. It contains three main topics: classification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. <!--SR:!2026-02-08,97,386!2026-02-13,101,386-->
  - IFRS 9 / history ::@:: The standard came into force on 1 January 2018, replacing the earlier IFRS for financial instruments, IAS 39. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,89,386!2026-01-25,85,374-->
  - IFRS 9 / example ::@:: Bank of America holds investment securities and loans, measured at fair value or amortized cost. <p> The framework provides criteria for measurement choice \(relevance vs. reliability\) and helps prevent asset overstatement during boom periods. <!--SR:!2026-01-09,68,366!2026-01-31,90,386-->
    - IFRS 9 / example / pre-IFRS 9 ::@:: During the 2008 crisis, BofA marked down mortgage‑backed securities by \$60 billion \(from a book value of \$300 billion to a fair value of \$240 billion\), generating \$4.3 billion in losses. <!--SR:!2026-01-09,68,366!2026-02-13,101,386-->
    - IFRS 9 / example / post-IFRS 9 ::@:: In 2023, BofA classifies \$400 billion of debt securities at amortized cost \(held to collect cash flows\) and \$100 billion at fair value through profit or loss \(trading portfolio\), with a \$5 billion swing in earnings due to fair‑value changes. <!--SR:!2026-02-03,93,386!2026-01-24,84,374-->

    - financial accounting / conceptual framework / purpose ::@:: Establishes a coherent set of concepts that underpin all IFRS pronouncements, enabling consistent rule‑making and fostering comparability across entities. \(Same case for most if not all national GAAPs.\) <!--SR:!2026-01-31,90,386!2026-02-12,100,386-->
    - financial accounting / conceptual framework / levels ::@:: 1. why: objective <br/> 2. financial statement elements, qualitative characteristics <br/> 3. how: assumptions, constraints, principles; disclosure, measurement, recognition <!--SR:!2026-02-01,91,386!2026-02-14,102,386-->

- topic: income statement; earnings management; earnings per share
- [income statement](../../../../general/income%20statement.md) ::@:: It is one of the financial statements of a company and shows the company's revenues and expenses during a particular period. <p> It indicates how the revenues \(also known as the _"top line"_\) are transformed into the net income or net profit \(the result after all revenues and expenses have been accounted for\). <!--SR:!2026-02-15,103,386!2026-01-08,67,366-->
  - income statement / purposes ::@:: - Provides a snapshot of a company's financial performance over a specific period. <br/> - Enables users to evaluate past results, forecast future earnings, and assess the risk associated with future cash‑flow generation. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,102,386!2026-01-10,69,366-->
  - income statement / limitations ::@:: - Items that cannot be measured reliably are often omitted, which can skew the picture of profitability. <br/> - The choice of accounting methods \(e.g., revenue recognition, depreciation\) influences reported income figures. <br/> - Income measurement requires significant judgement; therefore, numbers may not fully reflect underlying economic reality. <!--SR:!2026-02-02,92,386!2026-02-07,96,386-->
- [earnings management](../../../../general/earnings%20management.md) ::@:: It, in accounting, is the act of intentionally influencing the process of financial reporting to obtain some private gain. <p> Companies sometimes time the recognition of revenues, expenses, gains or losses to meet earnings targets or to present a smoother profit trend. <!--SR:!2026-01-26,86,374!2026-02-06,95,386-->
  - earnings management / effects ::@:: When earnings are manipulated in this way, the resulting "quality" of earnings drops because the information becomes less useful for predicting future performance. <!--SR:!2026-02-08,97,386!2026-02-08,97,386-->
- income statement
  - income statement / elements ::@:: income \(revenues, gains\), expenses \(\(_ordinary_\) expenses, losses\) <!--SR:!2026-01-21,81,374!2026-01-31,90,386-->

    - income statement / elements / revenues ::@:: cash or non‑cash inflows from ordinary business activities \(sales, fees, interest, dividends, rent\) <!--SR:!2026-02-06,95,386!2026-02-09,98,386-->
    - income statement / elements / gains ::@:: increases in economic benefits that arise inside or outside routine operations \(e.g., sale of long‑term assets, unrealised gains on trading securities\) <!--SR:!2026-02-12,100,386!2026-02-03,93,386-->
    - income statement / elements / expenses ::@:: outflows or depletions that reduce economic benefits, again excluding distributions to shareholders <p> may also refer to _ordinary_ expenses only, which arise from ordinary business activities \(cost of goods sold, depreciation, interest, salaries, taxes\) <!--SR:!2026-02-09,98,386!2026-02-12,100,386-->
    - income statement / elements / losses ::@:: reductions in equity from ordinary or non-ordinary activities \(e.g., restructuring charges, disposal losses, unrealised trading‑security losses\) <!--SR:!2026-02-12,100,386!2026-02-08,97,386-->
  - income statement / components ::@:: important items: <p> 1. gross profit <br/> 2. income from operations <br/> 3. income before income tax <br/> 4. income from continuing operations <br/> 5. net income <br/> 6. non-controlling interest <br/> 7. \(basic and diluted\) earnings per share <!--SR:!2026-01-03,63,354!2025-11-12,10,346-->
    - income statement / components / gross profit ::@:: Calculated as Net Sales minus Cost of Goods Sold \(COGS\). The "Net" in Net Sales accounts for discounts, allowances, returns, etc. <p> A key indicator for evaluating operational efficiency and predicting future earnings. Industry benchmarks vary widely: e.g., Apple's gross margin was 46.7% in FY 2024, while Pfizer's exceeded 70%. <!--SR:!2026-02-12,100,386!2026-02-14,102,386-->
    - income statement / components / other income and expense ::@:: They are _operating_ incomes and expenses that do not fit into the revenues and expenses categories above, and usually includes \(different depending on core businesses\): <p> - Write‑downs of inventories or fixed assets, restructuring provisions and their reversals. <!--SR:!2026-02-15,103,386!2026-01-16,73,366-->
    - income statement / components / income from operations ::@:: Derived by subtracting selling expenses, administrative expenses, plus other other income and expense, from Gross Profit. <p> Highlights the earnings that stem directly from core business activities and is often used to forecast cash‑flow timing and uncertainty. <!--SR:!2026-02-03,93,386!2026-02-03,93,386-->
    - income statement / components / non-operating items ::@ They are _non-operating_ incomes and expenses, and usually includes \(different depending on core businesses\): <p> - Disposal gains or losses on property, plant & equipment or investments. <br/> - Rent revenue, dividend revenue, interest revenue, etc. <br/> - Litigation settlements and other liability reversals that materially affect financial results.

      - income statement / components / income before income tax / motivation ::@:: By removing the effect of tax policy, jurisdictional differences, and timing of tax settlements, income before tax offers a cleaner view of how well a company's core operations are performing. <p> It allows cross‑company comparisons even when those companies operate in countries with vastly different statutory tax rates or have differing levels of deferred tax assets/liabilities. <!--SR:!2026-02-08,97,386!2026-02-05,94,386-->
    - income statement / components / income from continuing operations ::@:: It refers to the part of a company's business that is expected to keep operating into the future. It excludes any segment or activity that has been sold, shut down, or otherwise declared as discontinued \(e.g., a divested subsidiary or a line of products no longer produced\). <!--SR:!2026-02-05,94,386!2026-02-04,93,386-->
    - income statement / components / discontinued operations ::@:: Losses \(or gains\) from discontinued operations. As it is below the tax items, _tax effects_ of those losses/gains needs to be accounted for. <p> They are reported separately and often in a distinct section below income from continuing operations. The loss or gain on the disposal of the discontinued segment is shown, along with its tax impact. <!--SR:!2026-01-10,69,366!2026-02-03,93,386-->
    - income statement / components / net income ::@:: It is _the bottom line_: revenue minus all expenses, gains, and losses \(including discontinued operations\) for the period. Frequently regarded as the most critical measure of a company's success or failure over a given timeframe. <!--SR:!2026-01-10,69,366!2026-02-12,100,386-->
    - income statement / components / non-controlling interest ::@:: It represents the portion of a subsidiary's equity that is not owned by the parent company. It is also called "minority interest" when referring to shareholders who hold less than 50% of voting rights in a subsidiary. In consolidated financial statements, NCI ensures that all economic interests in the subsidiary are reported, not just those belonging to the parent. <!--SR:!2026-01-24,84,374!2026-02-14,102,386-->
      - income statement / components / non-controlling interest / effect ::@:: _Net income attributable to non‑controlling interest_ is shown as a separate line item below \(or above\) earnings attributable to the parent. This figure equals the subsidiary's net income multiplied by the NCI ownership percentage. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,90,386!2026-02-09,98,386-->
    - income statement / components / earnings per share \(EPS\) ::@:: Calculated by dividing Net Income less _Preferred Dividends_ by the weighted‑average number of _ordinary_ shares outstanding. Must appear prominently on the face of the income statement because it directly relates company performance to shareholder value. <p> Both _basic_ and _diluted_ EPS are reported. <!--SR:!2026-02-01,91,386!2026-01-13,71,366-->
      - income statement / components / earnings per share / basic ::@:: It is the portion of a company's profit that is attributable to each share of common stock outstanding. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,101,386!2026-02-06,95,386-->
      - income statement / components / earnings per share / diluted ::@:: It is a company's earnings per share calculated using fully diluted shares outstanding \(i.e. including the impact of stock option grants and convertible bonds\). <!--SR:!2026-02-05,94,386!2026-01-31,90,386-->
- [earnings per share](../../../../general/earnings%20per%20share.md) \(EPS\) ::@:: It is the monetary value of earnings per outstanding share of common stock for a company during a defined period of time, often a year. It is a key measure of corporate profitability, focusing on the interests of the company's owners \(shareholders\), and is commonly used to price stocks. <!--SR:!2026-02-07,96,386!2026-02-09,98,386-->
  - earnings per share / formula ::@:: earnings per share = ⁠\(net income − preferred dividends\) / weighted average common shares <!--SR:!2026-02-12,100,386!2026-01-31,90,386-->

  - IFRS 5 / discontinued operations ::@:: It is a component of an enterprise that has either been disposed of, or is classified as 'held for sale', and: <p> - represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; and <br/> - is part of a single, co-ordinated plan to dispose of this separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or <br/> - is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. <p> These criteria ensure that only significant, standalone divestitures are treated as discontinued operations. <!--SR:!2025-12-12,45,346!2026-01-03,63,354-->
    - IFRS 5 / discontinued operations / examples ::@:: selling divisions, lines of business, subsidiaries to other companies; spinning off independent companies <!--SR:!2026-02-06,95,386!2026-02-10,94,381-->
  - IFRS 5 / reporting requirements ::@:: _Separate income‑statement line items_ as a _separate category_ after "income from continuing operations" must disclose: <p> - Gain or loss from disposal. <br/> - Operating results of the disposed component \(as if it were still part of the company\). <br/> - Net of tax, as it is below the tax items. <br/> - Per‑share amounts \(EPS\) for continuing operations, discontinued operations, and total must be presented either on the face of the statement or in accompanying notes. <!--SR:!2025-12-14,47,346!2026-01-13,71,366-->
    - IFRS 5 / reporting requirements / motivation ::@:: The presentation is designed to keep the impact of major divestitures transparent and distinct from ongoing business performance. <!--SR:!2026-02-05,94,386!2026-02-03,93,386-->
    - IFRS 5 / reporting requirements / example ::@:: A diversified firm, decided to discontinue its electronics division during the year. <p> - Operating loss for the division \(net of tax\): £300&nbsp;000. <br/> - Loss on sale of the division at year‑end \(net of tax\): £500&nbsp;000. <p> These figures would be shown in the discontinued‑operations section, allowing stakeholders to see the full effect of the divestiture separate from core operations. <!--SR:!2026-01-15,73,366!2026-02-02,92,386-->
- [minority interest](../../../../general/minority%20interest.md) ::@:: It is the portion of a subsidiary corporation's stock that is not owned by the parent corporation. The magnitude of the minority interest in the subsidiary company is generally less than 50% of outstanding shares, or the corporation would generally cease to be a subsidiary of the parent. <!--SR:!2026-02-07,96,386!2026-02-01,91,386-->
  - minority interest / consolidated financial statements ::@:: In consolidated financial statements, if the parent owns more than 50% of a subsidiary, it consolidates 100% of the subsidiary's revenues, assets, and liabilities. <p> Note that subsidiaries can own subsidiaries of their own. <!--SR:!2026-02-08,97,386!2026-02-03,93,386-->
  - minority interest / income statement ::@:: The portion of profits or losses attributable to minority shareholders is reported separately as _non‑controlling interest_ \(NCI\) on the equity section. <p> Generally, net income, those attributable to majority interest, and those attribute to minority interest, are reported separately.

- [comprehensive income](../../../../general/comprehensive%20income.md) ::@:: It is "the change in equity \[net assets\] of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners." <!--SR:!2026-02-01,91,386!2026-02-06,95,386-->
  - comprehensive income / components ::@:: It encompasses: <p> - All revenues, gains, expenses, and losses that appear in net income. <br/> - Other comprehensive income \(OCI\): Additional items that bypass net income but still affect equity \(e.g., unrealized gains/losses on certain securities, foreign‑currency translation adjustments, pension and post‑retirement benefit adjustments, cash‑flow hedge gains/losses\). <!--SR:!2026-01-14,72,366!2026-01-03,63,354-->
  - comprehensive income / other comprehensive income ::@:: Additional items that bypass net income but still affect equity \(e.g., unrealized gains/losses on certain securities, foreign‑currency translation adjustments, pension and post‑retirement benefit adjustments, cash‑flow hedge gains/losses\). <p> Also see _accumulated other comprehensive income_ \(AOCI\). <!--SR:!2026-01-03,63,354!2026-02-09,98,386-->

    - comprehensive income / presentation / comprehensive income statement ::@:: It start with the net income. And then two sections called "items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss" and "items that will not be reclassified to profit and loss". Finally, sum appropriately to get the "other comprehensive income" and then "total comprehensive income". <p> If there is NCI, total comprehensive income, those attributable to majority interest, and those attribute to minority interest are reported separately. <!--SR:!2026-01-16,73,366!2026-01-10,69,366-->
- [accumulated other comprehensive income](../../../../general/accumulated%20other%20comprehensive%20income.md) \(AOCI\) ::@:: Since other comprehensive income \(OCI\) are not closed to retained earnings each period they accumulate as shareholder equity items and thus are entitled "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" and is sometimes referred to as "AOCI". <!--SR:!2026-02-13,101,386!2026-02-15,103,386-->
  - accumulated other comprehensive income / rationale ::@:: They are excluded from net income because they are either unrealized \(e.g., market‑value adjustments\), non‑operational, or volatile \(which harms comparability\). <p> They are subject to market fluctuations that have not yet been realized through a transaction \(e.g., AFS securities, currency translation\), or caused by events unrelated to core business operations \(e.g., actuarial adjustments to pension plans, financial volatility\). <!--SR:!2026-01-31,90,386!2026-02-12,100,386-->

    - balance sheet / uses / computing rates of return ::@:: By comparing equity or debt levels with earnings, analysts can derive internal rate of return metrics. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,89,386!2026-02-06,95,386-->
    - balance sheet / uses / evaluating capital structure ::@:: The relative proportions of debt to equity reveal how aggressively a firm is leveraged and inform creditworthiness assessments. <!--SR:!2025-12-26,59,366!2026-02-13,101,386-->
    - balance sheet / uses / assessing risk and future cash flows ::@:: Asset composition \(e.g., liquidity vs. long‑term investments\) helps forecast the ability to generate cash in coming periods. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,101,386!2026-02-14,102,386-->
    - balance sheet / uses / liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility ::@:: Key ratios such as current ratio, quick ratio, debt‑to‑equity and interest coverage are derived directly from balance‑sheet figures. <!--SR:!2026-02-07,96,386!2026-02-01,91,386-->

    - Goldman Sachs / subprime mortgage crisis / analysis ::@:: The firm's balance sheet exposed it to a classic "liquidity‑funding mismatch" amplified by high leverage and exposure to deteriorating mortgage assets. The 2008 crisis forced the firm to sell illiquid securities at steep discounts, absorb massive losses, and subsequently strengthen capital and liquidity buffers under new regulatory regimes. <!--SR:!2026-02-05,94,386!2026-02-02,92,386-->

  - Lehman Brothers / subprime mortgage crisis ::@:: - As of Q2 2008, total assets were \$691 billion and liabilities \$668 billion \(including \$120 billion long‑term debt\). <br/> - Equity stood at only \$23 billion, producing a staggering debt‑to‑equity ratio of roughly 29:1—well above the industry average of ~15:1 for banks. <br/> - EBIT barely covered interest expenses, giving an interest coverage ratio below one and signaling imminent distress that culminated in bankruptcy later that year. <!--SR:!2026-01-10,69,366!2026-02-09,98,386-->
    - Lehman Brothers / subprime mortgage crisis / analysis ::@:: The firm's balance sheet was a textbook case of "leverage‑driven insolvency". A 29:1 debt‑to‑equity ratio, minimal interest coverage, and a heavy concentration in distressed mortgage assets left the firm unable to survive the sudden credit crunch, culminating in its historic bankruptcy. <!--SR:!2026-02-05,94,386!2026-01-08,67,366-->
- [Evergrande Group](../../../../general/Evergrande%20Group.md) ::@:: It is a defunct Chinese property development company.

  - Evergrande Group / Chinese property sector crisis ::@:: - The company reported assets of about ¥2.40 trillion \(~\$370 billion\), largely consisting of undeveloped land and unfinished properties, against liabilities of roughly ¥2.43 trillion \(~\$375 billion\). <br/> - Shareholders' equity turned negative by ~¥30 billion due to asset impairments and accumulated losses. <br/> - Net gearing \(debt‑to‑equity\) surged past 300% by mid‑2021, far exceeding the regulatory cap of 100%; debt‑to‑assets reached roughly 85%, leaving minimal cushion for operating income to cover a $10 billion annual interest burden \(interest coverage &lt;0.5x\). <!--SR:!2026-02-06,95,386!2026-01-12,70,366-->
    - Evergrande Group / Chinese property sector crisis / analysis ::@:: The firm's balance sheet is a <!-- textbook --> case of "over‑leverage with negative equity". The combination of high debt, illiquid land assets, inadequate cash flow, and tightening regulatory constraints left the company unable to meet its obligations, leading to a cascading default that has reverberated across China’s real‑estate and financial markets. <!-- Might be inaccurate depending if the AI model contains this event in its training data... --> <!--SR:!2026-02-02,92,386!2026-01-03,63,354-->

  - return on equity / interpretation ::@:: The percentage of earnings earned for each dollar of equity. A high ROE indicates that management is using shareholders' capital efficiently to produce profits. <!--SR:!2026-02-04,93,386!2026-02-15,103,386-->
  - return on equity / use cases ::@:: Investors compare ROEs across companies or industries to gauge relative profitability; analysts use it as a key input in valuation models \(e.g., the DuPont analysis\). <!--SR:!2026-02-04,93,386!2026-01-31,90,386-->
  - return on equity / limitations ::@:: ROE can be inflated by high leverage \(low equity base\) or one‑time earnings, and it varies widely among sectors. Therefore, it should be interpreted alongside other ratios such as Debt‑to‑Equity and interest coverage to assess overall financial health. <!--SR:!2026-02-12,100,386!2026-02-04,93,386-->

  - DuPoint analysis / asset turnover ::@:: The component that measures how effectively a firm uses its assets to generate revenue; higher turnover signals better asset utilization: $$\frac {\text{Net Sales} } {\text{Average Total Assets} } \,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-01-26,86,374!2026-02-06,95,386-->
  - DuPoint analysis / equity multiplier ::@:: Also called __leverage__. The component reflects financial leverage; a larger multiplier means the company relies more on debt relative to equity: $$\frac{\text{Average Total Assets} } {\text{Average Shareholders' Equity} } \,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-01-25,85,374!2026-02-04,93,386-->
  - DuPoint analysis / use cases ::@:: By examining each component, managers and investors can see whether ROE growth stems from improved profitability, smarter asset deployment, or increased leverage—and conversely identify where inefficiencies lie. <!--SR:!2025-12-14,47,346!2026-02-06,95,386-->
  - DuPoint analysis / interpretation ::@:: The DuPont model also highlights that an attractive ROE may be driven by high debt rather than genuine operational strength, underscoring the importance of balancing all three factors. <!--SR:!2026-02-05,94,386!2026-02-08,97,386-->

- topic:
- return on assets
  - return on assets / peer analysis ::@:: We can compare ROA among companies in the same industry. Compared to ROE, leverage effect is ignored. <p> Tesla's ROA \(~2.96%\) is modest relative to peers like BYD \(~3.48%\) but higher than several Chinese EV players whose ROAs are negative or close to zero, which underscores early‑stage losses or heavy capital outlays. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,27,400!2025-11-18,27,400-->
- debt-to-equity ratio
- return on equity
  - return on equity / peer analysis ::@:: We can compare ROE among companies in the same industry. Compared to ROA, leverage effect is reflected. <p> For example, comparing trailing-12-month \(TTM\) ratio for major automakers, Tesla's ~8.18% sits below Toyota and BYD, while BYD's extraordinary ~21.79% reflects high profitability and potentially greater leverage. Negative ROEs for newer entrants \(e.g., NIO, XPeng\) underscore early‑stage losses or heavy capital outlays. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,26,400!2025-11-17,26,400-->

    - cash flow statement / investing cash flows / inflows ::@:: proceeds from selling property, plant & equipment (PPE) or securities; cash received from the sale of business units or subsidiaries <!--SR:!2025-11-18,27,400!2025-11-17,26,400-->
    - cash flow statement / investing cash flows / inflows ::@:: capital expenditures for new machinery or facilities, purchases of long‑term investments, and payments made in acquiring another company's assets <!--SR:!2025-11-11,20,380!2025-11-12,21,379-->
  - cash flow statement / financing cash flows ::@:: Cash movements that arise from transactions with a firm's owners and creditors—essentially how the business raises or returns capital <!--SR:!2025-11-17,26,400!2025-11-17,26,399-->
    - cash flow statement / financing cash flows / inflows ::@:: proceeds from issuing debt \(bonds, loans\) or equity \(new shares\), as well as cash received from investors in capital contribution <!--SR:!2025-11-17,26,400!2025-11-18,27,400-->
    - cash flow statement / financing cash flows / outflows ::@:: repayment of principal on debt, dividend payments to shareholders, share buybacks, and other financing costs such as interest expense paid in cash <!--SR:!2025-11-18,27,400!2025-11-17,26,400-->
  - cash flow statement / methods ::@:: Under IFRS, the _indirect method_ is commonly employed. Standards encourage the _direct method_ for greater transparency but do not mandate it; and even when using the direct method, a separate reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating activities must be disclosed as required by IAS 7; hence, most entities present the indirect method only. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,26,400!2025-11-18,27,400-->
    - cash flow statement / methods / indirect method ::@:: Under IFRS, the indirect method is commonly employed: starting from net income \(after interests and tax\), adjustments are made for non‑cash items \(depreciation, amortization\), reclassifications of gains/losses on asset sales or liability retirements, and changes in working capital components \(receivables, inventory, payables\). This reconciles accrual‑based earnings to actual cash movement. <p> This is only used for _operating_ activities. The direct method is still used for investing and financing activities. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,26,400!2025-11-18,27,400-->
    - cash flow statement / methods / direct method ::@:: While the direct method reports gross cash receipts \(e.g., cash from customers\) minus cash payments \(e.g., to suppliers\), it is rarely used because it requires detailed transaction data not available in the two‑balance‑sheet approach. <p> Note the _actual_ amount of _cash_ is used. For example, if an investment of book value \$10&nbsp;000 was sold in cash with a loss of \$2&nbsp;000, record \$8&nbsp;000 for the sale in investing activities. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,26,400!2025-11-18,27,399-->
  - cash flow statement / presentation ::@:: The presentation using the direct and indirect method both have 3 sections in the following order: operating, investing, and financing activities, each section with a subtotal for the net change in cash. Then, the net change in cash and cash equivalents is summed from the three sections to show how cash balances move over the reporting period. Then, report the cash balance at the beginning of the period and at its close. \(Slight reasonable variations in the item ordering is okay.\) <!--SR:!2025-11-11,20,380!2025-11-17,26,400-->
    - cash flow statement / presentation / indirect method ::@:: Starts with net income and adjusts for non‑cash items \(depreciation, amortization\), reclassifications \(gains/losses on asset sales\), and changes in working‑capital accounts to arrive at operating cash flow. <p> Offers a convenient linkage between the income statement and balance sheet, making it easier for preparers to compute without detailed transaction data. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,26,400!2025-11-17,26,399-->
    - cash flow statement / presentation / direct method ::@:: Even when using the direct method, a separate reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating activities must be disclosed as required by IAS 7. <p> Presents _gross_ cash receipts and payments for each operating activity line item \(e.g., cash received from customers minus cash paid to suppliers\). <p> Provides a more transparent view of the actual cash flows without adjustments, allowing stakeholders to see how much cash was generated or used in specific operational transactions. <!--SR:!2025-11-11,20,380!2025-11-18,27,400-->
  - cash flow statement / indirect method ::@:: The indirect method reconstructs the statement of cash flows by starting with accrual‑based earnings \(net income\) and systematically adjusting for all items that affect cash but are not reflected in the income statement, or those that are accounted for in investing or financing activities. <!--SR:!2025-11-24,21,390!2025-12-01,28,410-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / steps ::@:: 1. net income <br/> 2. non-cash items <br/> 3. reclassification <br/> 4. changes in working capital <br/> 5. operating cash flows <br/> 6. investing cash flows <br/> 7. financing cash flows <br/> 8. net change <br/> 9. reconciliation <!--SR:!2025-12-28,52,360!2025-11-11,20,380-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / net income ::@:: Begin with net income: Use the net profit figure from the most recent income statement as the starting point. Include interest and tax effects. <p> Some approaches start with the income before interest and tax, and present "cash generated from operations", which does not include interest and tax, and "net cash from operating activities" separately. <!--SR:!2025-11-11,20,380!2025-11-11,20,380-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / non-cash items ::@:: Add back non‑cash expenses: Include depreciation, amortization, and other non‑cash charges that reduced earnings but did not involve an actual cash outflow. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,26,400!2025-11-17,26,400-->
      - cash flow statement / indirect method / non-cash items / uncommon examples ::@:: deferred income taxes, digital assets \(gain\) loss, foreign currency transaction net unrealized \(gain\) loss, inventory write-downs, non-cash interest, other operating activities, stock-based compensation, etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-12,21,379!2025-11-11,20,380-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / reclassification ::@:: Subtract or add gains/losses on asset transactions \(investing\) or liability retirement \(financing\): Remove gains \(which inflated income as investing or financing activities\) from the operating section; add losses \(which reduced income as investing or financing activities\). <!--SR:!2025-11-11,20,379!2025-11-18,27,400-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / changes in working capital ::@:: - _Increase in non-cash current assets_ \(e.g., accounts receivable, inventory\): subtract the amount as it represents a use of cash. <br/> - _Decrease in non-cash current assets_: add the amount, indicating a release of cash. <br/> - _Increase in current liabilities_ \(e.g., accounts payable, accrued expenses\): add the amount, reflecting cash retained. <br/> - _Decrease in current liabilities_: subtract the amount, showing cash used to settle obligations. <!--SR:!2025-11-11,20,380!2025-11-12,21,379-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / operating cash flows ::@:: Calculate net cash provided by \(used in\) operating activities: Sum all adjustments from steps 2–4 with the net income to arrive at operating cash flow. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,27,400!2025-11-18,27,400-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / investing cash flows ::@:: Determine investing activity cash flow: Add cash proceeds \(use _actual_ received cash\) from sales of PPE or investments; subtract purchases \(use _actual_ used cash\) of PPE, new investments, and any acquisition costs. <p> Ignore cash flows due to ordinary tax \(e.g. tax on gain or loss, i.e. capital gain tax\), which are already accounted for in operating cash flows. Transaction-specific taxes \(e.g. VAT tax, sales tax\) are _not_ ignored, as they are part of the investment cost by the cost principle. <!--SR:!2025-11-11,20,380!2025-11-18,27,400-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / financing cash flows ::@:: Determine financing activity cash flow: Add proceeds \(use _actual_ received cash\) from issuing debt or equity; subtract repayments \(use _actual_ used cash\) of debt, dividends paid, share buybacks, and other financing outflows. <p> Ignore cash flows due to tax \(e.g. tax shield\), which are already accounted for in operating cash flows. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,27,400!2025-11-18,27,400-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / net change ::@:: Compute net change in cash and cash equivalents: Combine the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing sections to find the net increase or decrease in cash for the period. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,27,400!2025-11-18,27,400-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / reconciliation ::@:: Reconcile opening and closing cash balances: Add the opening cash balance to the net change calculated in step 8; verify that the result equals the closing cash balance reported on the balance sheet. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,27,400!2025-11-18,27,400-->
  - cash flow statement / required disclosures ::@:: The SCF must be accompanied by footnotes explaining non‑cash events that affect cash \(e.g., issuing shares to buy assets, converting bonds into equity, or asset exchanges\). <!--SR:!2025-11-17,26,400!2025-11-17,26,400-->
  - cash flow statement / supplementary disclosures ::@:: cash paid for interest, cash paid for income taxes \(net of refunds\), etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,26,400!2025-11-17,26,399-->
  - cash flow statement / limitations ::@:: Although the indirect method simplifies preparation, it can overlook complex transactions such as business combinations, equity issuances, or off‑balance‑sheet items—making the final statement an approximation unless supplemented with detailed internal data. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,27,400!2025-11-17,26,399-->
  - cash flow statement / verifiability ::@:: Preparing a SCF obliges management to verify its accuracy and exposes them to auditor scrutiny, thereby reducing opportunities for classification manipulation \(e.g., moving cash flows between operating and financing\). <!--SR:!2025-11-12,21,379!2025-11-18,27,399-->
  - cash flow statement / comparability ::@:: By standardizing the presentation of cash movements, the SCF enhances comparability across firms, enabling investors and analysts to assess liquidity, operational efficiency, and capital‑structure decisions more reliably. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,27,400!2025-11-18,27,399-->
