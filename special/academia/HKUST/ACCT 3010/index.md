- topic: environment framework; conceptual framework; financial reporting
- [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) ::@:: It is a branch of accounting concerned with the summary, analysis and reporting of financial transactions related to a business.
  - financial accounting / environment ::@:: Accounting produces financial statements for financial reporting purposes. They are used by stakeholders to allocate capital. High-quality standards are needed to standardize accounting practices and financial statements, so that stakeholders can be well-informed.
  - financial reporting / organizations ::@:: International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\): the independent accounting standard-setting body of the IFRS Foundation <br/> International Organization of Securities Commissions \(IOSCO\): an association of organizations that regulate the world's securities and futures markets
  - financial reporting / conceptual framework ::@:: A conceptual framework is needed for accounting to standardize accounting practices and financial statements. One such framework is International Financial Reporting Standards \(IFRS\). It has been developed \(and continuously developed to handle new environments\) over a long time. We should be aware of its overview, its objectives, e.g. elements of financial statements, qualitative characteristics of accounting information, etc.
  - financial reporting / assumptions and principles ::@:: There are many assumptions and principles in accounting, e.g. cost constraint.
  - financial reporting / challenges ::@:: convergence of standards, ethics, expectation gap, financial reporting issues, politics, etc.
- [International Financial Reporting Standards](../../../../general/International%20Financial%20Reporting%20Standards.md) \(IFRS\) ::@:: They are accounting standards issued by the IFRS Foundation and the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\). They constitute a standardised way of describing the company's financial performance and position so that company financial statements are understandable and comparable across international boundaries. They are particularly relevant for companies with shares or securities publicly listed.
  - International Financial Reporting Standards / convergence ::@:: IFRS have replaced many different national accounting standards around the world but have not replaced the separate accounting standards in the United States where US GAAP is applied. <p> Most jurisdictions requires IFRS for most or all companies. A few jurisdictions permits IFRS \(and allows other formats\). Only a few jurisdictions have their own national standards, some of which are converging to IFRS.
  - International Financial Reporting Standards / motivation ::@:: Economics around the world are increasingly intertwined under _globalization_. Even Donald Trump's recent policies do not stop it \(as seen from Frankel index, trade volume, etc.\) <p> Many national exchanges list a significant foreign companies, making up a significant portion of market capitalization, e.g. Chinese stocks in the United States.
    - International Financial Reporting Standards / motivation / foreign exchanges ::@:: By listing on foreign exchanges, companies can raise more international funds rather than from domestic ones only. Foreign investors have more choices for investments. For example, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. went public \(IPO\) on the New York Stock Exchange \(NYSE\) in 2014. Later, it had a secondary on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange \(HKEX\) on 2019-11.
- [capital market](../../../../general/capital%20market.md) ::@:: It is a financial market in which long-term debt \(over a year\) or equity-backed securities are bought and sold, in contrast to a money market where short-term debt is bought and sold.
  - capital market / financial and information flows ::@:: Capital flows from households and investors to firms via financial regulators, institutions, or intermediaries. Information flows from firms to households and investors via accounting regulators, auditors, or information intermediaries. <p> The financial intermediaries and information intermediaries exchange capital and information with each other.
- financial reporting
  - financial reporting / importance ::@:: Many economics depressions are linked to poor quality accounting information, e.g. the Great Depression \(1929–39\), savings and loans crisis \(1980s–early 90s\), Asian financial crisis \(1997–98\), dot-com bubble \(2000–02\), global financial crisis \(2007–09\), etc.
  - financial reporting / essential characteristics ::@:: _Identify_, _measure_, and _communicate_ financial information of economic entities to interested parties. Users can then _allocate_ capital _efficiently_, ensuring capital markets are efficient.
- ACCT 3010
  - ACCT 3010 / introduction
    - ACCT 3010 / introduction / artificial intelligence
- International Financial Reporting Standards
  - International Financial Reporting Standards / importance ::@:: common corporate governance, common delivery systems \(e.g. XBRL\), common disclosure, common laws and regulations, consistency, education and training, quality information, quality practices, etc.
- [International Accounting Standards Board](../../../../general/International%20Accounting%20Standards%20Board.md) \(IASB\) ::@:: It is the independent accounting standard-setting body of the IFRS Foundation. <p> It was founded on 2001-04-01, as the successor to the International Accounting Standards Committee \(IASC\). It is responsible for developing International Financial Reporting Standards \(IFRS\) and for promoting their use and application.
  - International Accounting Standards Board / due process ::@:: Identify a _topic_ to place on the Board's agenda. Research and analyze to produce pros and cons. Hold _public hearings_. Evaluate to produce a _exposure draft_. Respond to responses to the exposure draft. Issue a _final standard_.
    - International Accounting Standards Board / due process / characteristics ::@:: _collaborative_ efforts <br/> _engagement_ with accountants, business leaders, investors, and regulators <br/> _independent_ standard-setting board <br/> _thorough_ and _systematic_ standard-setting process

- topic:
- financial accounting
  - financial accounting / environment
  - financial accounting / conceptual framework
- [IFRS 16](../../../../general/IFRS%2016.md) ::@:: It is an International Financial Reporting Standard \(IFRS\) promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\) providing guidance on accounting for leases.
  - IFRS 16 / history ::@:: It was issued in January 2016 and is effective for most companies that report under IFRS since 1 January 2019. Upon becoming effective, it replaced the earlier leasing standard, IAS 17.
  - IFRS 16 / lessees ::@:: It has a substantial impact on the financial statements of lessees of property and equipment – requiring that leases be placed on-balance sheet by recognising a 'right-of-use' asset and a lease liability.
    - IFRS 16 / lessees / pre-IFRS 16 ::@:: Lease payments were treated purely as operating expenses with no balance‑sheet impact.
    - IFRS 16 / lessees / under IFRS 16 ::@:: Lease payments must be placed on-balance sheet by recognizing a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.
  - IFRS 16 / lessors ::@:: It substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases.
  - IFRS 16 / example ::@:: Delta Airlines is one of the world's largest airlines and leases most of its fleet. <p> Prior to IFRS 16 \(IAS 17\) these leases were classified largely as operating leases—the lease payments appeared only on the income statement, with no corresponding asset or liability on the balance sheet. <p> The transition to IFRS 16 \(effective 2019\) required almost all lessees to recognize a right‑of‑use \(ROU\) asset and an associated lease liability for every lease that has a term of more than 12 months, unless it is a short‑term lease or a low‑value asset.
    - IFRS 16 / example / lease terms ::@:: - Duration: 5 years <br/> - Annual lease payment: \$10 million → total cash outflow of \$50 million over the lease life. <br/> - Discount rate \(Delta's incremental borrowing rate\): 5% <p> - Using a 5% discount factor for a 5‑year annuity, the present value \(PV\) of future payments is **\$43.3 million**.
    - IFRS 16 / example / pre-IFRS 16 treatment ::@:: - Each year, $10 million was recorded as an operating lease expense on the income statement. <br/> - No asset or liability appeared on the balance sheet; the aircraft remained a _fixed asset_ \(purchased or financed separately\). <br/> - Cash‑flow impact: Operating cash outflows of $10 million each year.
    - IFRS 16 / example / lease liability treatment ::@:: Use the _effective‑interest_ amortization method. <p> - Recognized at PV = \$43.3 million. <br/> - The liability is reduced over time by the principal portion of lease payments; interest expense is recognized on the remaining balance. <br/> - Year‑1 interest: 5% × \$43.3 million = **\$2.165 million**. <br/> - Principal payment in year 1 = \$10 million – \$2.165 million = **\$7.835 million**, reducing the liability to \$35.465 million for year 2.
    - IFRS 16 / example / right-of-use asset treatment ::@:: - Also recognized at \$43.3 million \(net of any lease incentives or initial direct costs\). <br/> - Amortized \("depreciation" but for intangible assets\) on a straight‑line basis \(other amortization methods may be used\) over the lease term: \$43.3 million ÷ 5 = **\$8.66 million per year**.
    - IFRS 16 / example / income statement impact ::@:: - Depreciation/amortization of ROU asset: \$8.66 million. <br/> - Interest expense on liability: \$2.165 million \(decreasing each subsequent year\). <br/> - Total lease cost in year 1: \$10.825 million, slightly higher than the pre‑IFRS 16 operating expense due to the inclusion of interest.
    - IFRS 16 / example / cash flow statement impact::@:: - Cash outflow remains \$10 million. <br/> - The principal portion \(\$7.835 million\) is reclassified from operating to financing activity; the interest component \(\$2.165 million\) stays in operating activities \(consistent with IAS 8 guidance on lease classification\).
    - IFRS 16 / example / balance sheet impact ::@:: - Increase in total assets by \$43.3 million \(ROU asset\). <br/> - Increase in total liabilities by \$43.3 million \(lease liability\), netting to zero change in equity directly from the lease.
    - IFRS 16 / example / Delta Airlines ::@:: Right‑of‑use assets totaled \$25.9 billion with lease liabilities of \$24.8 billion; annual payments averaged \$4.5 billion over 5–15 year terms at a weighted‑average discount rate of 4.5%.
  - IFRS 16 / implementation steps ::@:: identify → recognize → amortize
    - IFRS 16 / implementation steps / identify ::@:: Identify all leases with terms &gt;12 months.
    - IFRS 16 / implementation steps / recognize ::@:: Compute PV of lease payments using the incremental borrowing rate or lessee's discount rate if it is more reflective of market conditions. Recognize ROU asset and liability at that PV; adjust for any lease incentives, initial direct costs, or residual value guarantees. \(There are several cases for adjustment, which will not be mentioned here.\)
    - IFRS 16 / implementation steps / amortize ::@:: Allocate depreciation/amortization over the lease term \(or shorter useful life if the asset's useful life is shorter\). Record interest expense on the lease liability using the effective‑interest method each reporting period.
- [IFRS 2](../../../../general/IFRS%202.md) ::@:: It is an international financial reporting standard issued in February 2004 by the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\) to provide guidance on the accounting for share based payments. <p> Its purpose is to reflect the cost of awarding equity or equity based incentives to employees or other parties in exchange for goods or services.
  - IFRS 2 / pre-IFRS 2 ::@:: Prior to IFRS 2, ESOs were disclosed but not expensed, masking significant compensation costs.
  - IFRS 2 / example ::@:: Amazon recorded \$19.6 billion in stock‑based compensation expense \(employee stock options \(ESOs\), restricted stock units \(RSUs\)\), valuing each option at a fair value of \$150 \(Black–Scholes model: volatility 30 %, risk‑free rate 3 %, term 5 years\). <p> The requirement to recognize outflows of economic benefits and measure them at fair value ensures that the true cost of ESOs \(e.g. Amazon's net income reduced by 10–15% post-expensing\) is reflected in net income, ensuring relevance for investors and comparability across firms.
- financial accounting
  - financial accounting / conceptual framework
    - financial accounting / conceptual framework / examples ::@:: A \$1,000,000 prize with 10,000 tickets sold; secondary market price per ticket is $90. The donor's purchase of one ticket for \$150 raises questions about appropriate measurement—whether to record at issue price, fair value \(\$90\), or some other basis.
- [IFRS 9](../../../../general/IFRS%209.md) ::@:: It is an International Financial Reporting Standard \(IFRS\) published by the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\). It addresses the accounting for financial instruments. It contains three main topics: classification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting.
  - IFRS 9 / history ::@:: The standard came into force on 1 January 2018, replacing the earlier IFRS for financial instruments, IAS 39.
  - IFRS 9 / example ::@:: Bank of America holds investment securities and loans, measured at fair value or amortized cost. <p> The framework provides criteria for measurement choice \(relevance vs. reliability\) and helps prevent asset overstatement during boom periods.
    - IFRS 9 / example / pre-IFRS 9 ::@:: During the 2008 crisis, BofA marked down mortgage‑backed securities by \$60 billion \(from a book value of \$300 billion to a fair value of \$240 billion\), generating \$4.3 billion in losses.
    - IFRS 9 / example / post-IFRS 9 ::@:: In 2023, BofA classifies \$400 billion of debt securities at amortized cost \(held to collect cash flows\) and \$100 billion at fair value through profit or loss \(trading portfolio\), with a \$5 billion swing in earnings due to fair‑value changes.
- financial accounting
  - financial accounting / conceptual framework
    - financial accounting / conceptual framework / purpose ::@:: Establishes a coherent set of concepts that underpin all IFRS pronouncements, enabling consistent rule‑making and fostering comparability across entities. \(Also applies to national GAAPs.\)
    - financial accounting / conceptual framework / levels ::@:: 1. why: objective <br/> 2. financial statement elements, qualitative characteristics <br/> 3. how: assumptions, constraints, principles; disclosure, measurement, recognition
  - financial accounting / objective ::@:: Provide useful financial information to investors, lenders, and other creditors through general‑purpose statements. Users are assumed to have reasonable knowledge of business and financial accounting for understanding the information.
  - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics ::@:: For _decision making_: Fundamental qualities, which are more important and should be prioritized, are distinguished from enhancing qualities. <p> Cost constraint is part of the framework: How will costs of providing information be balanced against its benefits?
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / all ::@:: faithful representation, relevance; comparability, timeliness, understandability, verifiability
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / fundamental ::@:: More important. Includes: faithful representation, relevance
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / enhancing ::@:: Less important. Includes: comparability, timeliness, understandability, verifiability
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / relevance ::@:: Information is _useful_ only if it can influence the decisions of users. Includes: confirmatory value, materiality, predictive value <p> Standards are drafted to ensure that disclosures affect how investors, lenders, and regulators evaluate an entity.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / faithful representation ::@:: The numbers and descriptions _mirror_ what really happened or existed. Includes: completeness, error-free, neutrality <p> IFRS mandates that all material items be recorded and presented in a manner that reflects reality, not management's preferences.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / predictive value ::@:: It helps forecast future events.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / confirmatory value ::@:: It confirms or corrects prior expectations.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / materiality ::@:: A omission or misstatement of material information matters if it could change an economic decision.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / completeness ::@:: All necessary information is included.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / neutrality ::@:: No bias toward any stakeholder group.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / error-free ::@:: Free from material mistakes.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / comparability ::@:: Information can be compared over time or across entities because it's measured consistently. <p> The Conceptual Framework urges uniform measurement bases \(e.g., fair value vs. historical cost\) so that entities can be compared.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / verifiability ::@:: Independent observers could reach a consensus that the information is an accurate depiction of reality. <p> Standards provide audit trails; auditors can test data against source documents.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / timeliness ::@:: Information is available to decision makers before it loses its influence. <p> Disclosure schedules, footnote disclosures, and management discussion sections are designed to be timely.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / understandability ::@:: The information can be comprehended by users who have reasonable knowledge and skill. <p> Disclosure schedules, footnote disclosures, and management discussion sections are designed to be comprehensible.
  - financial accounting / core assumptions ::@:: accrual basis, economic entity, going concern, monetary unit, periodicity
    - financial accounting / core assumptions / economic entity ::@:: A company's activities are separate from those of its owners or other businesses.
    - financial accounting / core assumptions / going concern ::@:: The business will continue operating for the foreseeable future, unless there is evidence to the contrary.
    - financial accounting / core assumptions / monetary unit ::@:: Money is the common denominator for all transactions \(U.S. dollars, euros, etc.\).
    - financial accounting / core assumptions / periodicity ::@:: The company's economic life can be divided into discrete reporting periods (quarterly, annually).
    - financial accounting / core assumptions / accrual basis ::@:: Revenues are recognized when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of cash flow timing.
  - financial accounting / measurement principles ::@:: Historical cost \(faithful representation\) vs. fair value \(market relevance\), with IASB permitting fair‑value measurement for financial assets/liabilities when appropriate.
    - financial accounting / measurement principles / historical cost ::@:: "The amount of money paid or the fair value of consideration given to acquire an asset."
    - financial accounting / measurement principles / fair value ::@:: "The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants."
    - financial accounting / measurement principles / amortized cost ::@:: "The amount of a financial asset or liability that is carried on the balance sheet, adjusted for any initial measurement adjustments, subsequent interest, principal repayments, and impairment." <p> - Applies to assets/liabilities held to collect contractual cash flows \(e.g., bonds\). <br> - Uses the effective‑interest method.
  - financial accounting / full disclosure ::@:: A company must provide all information that is material and would influence the decisions of an informed user. They are required to be presented in _statements_, _notes_, or _supplementary disclosures_.
  - financial accounting / cost constraint ::@:: Companies must weight the benefits of information against the costs of providing them. <p> For example, to justify a particular disclosure or measure, a company must demonstrate that the benefits outweigh its costs; otherwise, it may not be mandated.
  - financial accounting / environments ::@:: IFRS operates within varying political environments, affecting enforcement and adoption. There are many stakeholders: academicians, accounting firms, businesses, financial community, governments, industry associations, investing public, preparers, etc.
  - financial accounting / challenges ::@:: Emerging challenges include non‑financial metrics, forward‑looking disclosures, intangible assets, and maintaining timeliness in rapidly changing markets.
