- topic: environment framework; conceptual framework; financial reporting
- [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) ::@:: It is a branch of accounting concerned with the summary, analysis and reporting of financial transactions related to a business. <!--SR:!2025-10-23,17,330!2025-10-24,18,330-->
  - financial accounting / environment ::@:: Accounting produces financial statements for financial reporting purposes. They are used by stakeholders to allocate capital. High-quality standards are needed to standardize accounting practices and financial statements, so that stakeholders can be well-informed. <!--SR:!2025-10-17,11,310!2025-10-19,13,310-->
  - financial reporting / organizations ::@:: International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\): the independent accounting standard-setting body of the IFRS Foundation <br/> International Organization of Securities Commissions \(IOSCO\): an association of organizations that regulate the world's securities and futures markets <!--SR:!2025-10-24,18,330!2025-10-22,16,330-->
  - financial reporting / conceptual framework ::@:: A conceptual framework is needed for accounting to standardize accounting practices and financial statements. One such framework is International Financial Reporting Standards \(IFRS\). It has been developed \(and continuously developed to handle new environments\) over a long time. We should be aware of its overview, its objectives, e.g. elements of financial statements, qualitative characteristics of accounting information, etc. <!--SR:!2025-10-18,12,310!2025-10-24,18,330-->
  - financial reporting / assumptions and principles ::@:: There are many assumptions and principles in accounting, e.g. cost constraint. <!--SR:!2025-10-24,18,330!2025-10-24,18,330-->
  - financial reporting / challenges ::@:: convergence of standards, ethics, expectation gap, financial reporting issues, politics, etc. <!--SR:!2025-10-23,17,330!2025-10-24,18,330-->
- [International Financial Reporting Standards](../../../../general/International%20Financial%20Reporting%20Standards.md) \(IFRS\) ::@:: They are accounting standards issued by the IFRS Foundation and the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\). They constitute a standardised way of describing the company's financial performance and position so that company financial statements are understandable and comparable across international boundaries. They are particularly relevant for companies with shares or securities publicly listed. <!--SR:!2025-10-18,12,310!2025-10-22,16,330-->
  - International Financial Reporting Standards / convergence ::@:: IFRS have replaced many different national accounting standards around the world but have not replaced the separate accounting standards in the United States where US GAAP is applied. <p> Most jurisdictions requires IFRS for most or all companies.

Only a few jurisdictions have their own national standards, some of which are converging to IFRS. <!--SR:!2025-10-18,12,310!2025-10-14,8,290-->
  - International Financial Reporting Standards / motivation ::@:: Economics around the world are increasingly intertwined under _globalization_. Even Donald Trump's recent policies do not stop it \(as seen from Frankel index, trade volume, etc.\) <p> Many national exchanges list a significant foreign companies, making up a significant portion of market capitalization, e.g. Chinese stocks in the United States. <!--SR:!2025-10-28,18,352!2025-10-28,18,352-->
    - International Financial Reporting Standards / motivation / foreign exchanges ::@:: By listing on foreign exchanges, companies can raise more international funds rather than from domestic ones only. Foreign investors have more choices for investments. For example, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. went public \(IPO\) on the New York Stock Exchange \(NYSE\) in 2014. Later, it had a secondary on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange \(HKEX\) on 2019-11. <!--SR:!2025-10-15,9,290!2025-10-14,8,290-->
- [capital market](../../../../general/capital%20market.md) ::@:: It is a financial market in which long-term debt \(over a year\) or equity-backed securities are bought and sold, in contrast to a money market where short-term debt is bought and sold. <!--SR:!2025-10-24,18,330!2025-10-22,16,330-->
  - capital market / financial and information flows ::@:: Capital flows from households and investors to firms via financial regulators, institutions, or intermediaries. Information flows from firms to households and investors via accounting regulators, auditors, or information intermediaries. <p> The financial intermediaries and information intermediaries exchange capital and information with each other. <!--SR:!2025-10-17,11,310!2025-10-18,12,310-->
- financial reporting
  - financial reporting / importance ::@:: Many economics depressions are linked to poor quality accounting information, e.g. the Great Depression \(1929–39\), savings and loans crisis \(1980s–early 90s\), Asian financial crisis \(1997–98\), dot-com bubble \(2000–02\), global financial crisis \(2007–09\), etc. <!--SR:!2025-10-17,11,310!2025-10-23,17,330-->
