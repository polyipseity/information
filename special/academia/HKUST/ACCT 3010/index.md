- topic: environment framework; conceptual framework; financial reporting
- [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) ::@:: It is a branch of accounting concerned with the summary, analysis and reporting of financial transactions related to a business. <!--SR:!2027-02-07,392,370!2027-03-05,412,370-->
  - financial accounting / environment ::@:: Accounting produces financial statements for financial reporting purposes. They are used by stakeholders to allocate capital. High-quality standards are needed to standardize accounting practices and financial statements, so that stakeholders can be well-informed. <!--SR:!2026-07-14,221,350!2026-06-25,191,330-->
  - financial reporting / organizations ::@:: International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\): the independent accounting standard-setting body of the IFRS Foundation <br/> International Organization of Securities Commissions \(IOSCO\): an association of organizations that regulate the world's securities and futures markets <!--SR:!2027-03-06,413,370!2027-01-15,369,370-->
  - financial reporting / conceptual framework ::@:: A conceptual framework is needed for accounting to standardize accounting practices and financial statements. One such framework is International Financial Reporting Standards \(IFRS\). It has been developed \(and continuously developed to handle new environments\) over a long time. We should be aware of its overview, its objectives, e.g. elements of financial statements, qualitative characteristics of accounting information, etc. <!--SR:!2026-08-01,236,350!2027-03-08,415,370-->
  - financial reporting / assumptions and principles ::@:: There are many assumptions and principles in accounting, e.g. cost constraint. <!--SR:!2027-03-09,416,370!2027-03-02,409,370-->
  - financial reporting / challenges ::@:: convergence of standards, ethics, expectation gap, financial reporting issues, politics, etc. <!--SR:!2027-02-02,387,370!2027-02-28,407,370-->
- [International Financial Reporting Standards](../../../../general/International%20Financial%20Reporting%20Standards.md) \(IFRS\) ::@:: They are accounting standards issued by the IFRS Foundation and the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\). They constitute a standardised way of describing the company's financial performance and position so that company financial statements are understandable and comparable across international boundaries. They are particularly relevant for companies with shares or securities publicly listed. <!--SR:!2026-07-28,233,350!2027-01-14,368,370-->
  - International Financial Reporting Standards / convergence ::@:: IFRS have replaced many different national accounting standards around the world but have not replaced the separate accounting standards in the United States where US GAAP is applied. <p> Most jurisdictions requires IFRS for most or all companies. A few jurisdictions permits IFRS \(and allows other formats\). Only a few jurisdictions have their own national standards, some of which are converging to IFRS. <!--SR:!2026-07-31,235,350!2026-03-30,136,330-->
  - International Financial Reporting Standards / motivation ::@:: Economics around the world are increasingly intertwined under _globalization_. Even Donald Trump's recent policies do not stop it \(as seen from Frankel index, trade volume, etc.\) <p> Many national exchanges list a significant foreign companies, making up a significant portion of market capitalization, e.g. Chinese stocks in the United States. <!--SR:!2026-11-03,296,372!2027-05-10,463,392-->
    - International Financial Reporting Standards / motivation / foreign exchanges ::@:: By listing on foreign exchanges, companies can raise more international funds rather than from domestic ones only. Foreign investors have more choices for investments. For example, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. went public \(IPO\) on the New York Stock Exchange \(NYSE\) in 2014. Later, it had a secondary on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange \(HKEX\) on 2019-11. <!--SR:!2026-04-22,153,330!2027-04-20,430,330-->
- [capital market](../../../../general/capital%20market.md) ::@:: It is a financial market in which long-term debt \(over a year\) or equity-backed securities are bought and sold, in contrast to a money market where short-term debt is bought and sold. <!--SR:!2027-03-07,414,370!2027-01-16,370,370-->
  - capital market / financial and information flows ::@:: _Capital flows_ from households and investors to firms _via_ financial regulators, institutions, or intermediaries. <p> _Information_ flows from firms to households and investors _via_ accounting regulators, auditors, or information intermediaries. <p> The financial intermediaries and information intermediaries _exchange_ capital and information with each other. <!--SR:!2026-03-04,107,330!2026-08-02,237,350-->
- financial reporting
  - financial reporting / importance ::@:: Many economics depressions are linked to poor quality accounting information, e.g. the Great Depression \(1929–39\), savings and loans crisis \(1980s–early 90s\), Asian financial crisis \(1997–98\), dot-com bubble \(2000–02\), global financial crisis \(2007–09\), etc. <!--SR:!2026-03-02,105,330!2027-02-01,386,370-->
  - financial reporting / essential characteristics ::@:: _Identify_, _measure_, and _communicate_ financial information of economic entities to interested parties. Users can then _allocate_ capital _efficiently_, ensuring capital markets are efficient. <!--SR:!2026-08-02,237,350!2026-04-09,141,330-->

- [IFRS 16](../../../../general/IFRS%2016.md) ::@:: It is an International Financial Reporting Standard \(IFRS\) promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\) providing guidance on accounting for leases. <!--SR:!2027-04-08,431,394!2027-06-21,501,406-->
  - IFRS 16 / history ::@:: It was issued in January 2016 and is effective for most companies that report under IFRS since 1 January 2019. Upon becoming effective, it replaced the earlier leasing standard, IAS 17. <!--SR:!2027-06-04,486,406!2027-05-31,484,406-->
  - IFRS 16 / lessees ::@:: It has a substantial impact on the financial statements of lessees of property and equipment – requiring that leases be placed on-balance sheet by recognising a 'right-of-use' asset and a lease liability. <!--SR:!2027-07-04,511,406!2027-08-07,540,406-->
    - IFRS 16 / lessees / pre-IFRS 16 ::@:: Lease payments were treated purely as operating expenses with no balance-sheet impact. <!--SR:!2027-04-04,427,394!2027-06-17,498,406-->
    - IFRS 16 / lessees / under IFRS 16 ::@:: Lease payments must be placed on-balance sheet by recognizing a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. <!--SR:!2027-05-28,481,406!2027-05-27,480,406-->
  - IFRS 16 / lessors ::@:: It substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases. <!--SR:!2027-06-15,497,406!2027-07-10,517,406-->
  - IFRS 16 / example ::@:: Delta Airlines is one of the world's largest airlines and leases most of its fleet. <p> Prior to IFRS 16 \(IAS 17\) these leases were classified largely as operating leases—the lease payments appeared only on the income statement, with no corresponding asset or liability on the balance sheet. <p> The transition to IFRS 16 \(effective 2019\) required almost all lessees to recognize a right-of-use \(ROU\) asset and an associated lease liability for every lease that has a term of more than 12 months, unless it is a short-term lease or a low-value asset. <!--SR:!2027-08-01,535,406!2027-07-28,531,406-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / lease terms ::@:: - Duration: 5 years <br/> - Annual lease payment: \$10 million → total cash outflow of \$50 million over the lease life. <br/> - Discount rate \(Delta's incremental borrowing rate\): 5% <p> Using a 5% discount factor for a 5-year annuity, the present value \(PV\) of future payments is __\$43.3 million__. <!--SR:!2027-08-10,542,406!2027-07-31,534,406-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / pre-IFRS 16 treatment ::@:: - Each year, $10 million was recorded as an operating lease expense on the income statement. <br/> - No asset or liability appeared on the balance sheet; the aircraft remained a _fixed asset_ \(purchased or financed separately\). <br/> - Cash-flow impact: Operating cash outflows of $10 million each year. <!--SR:!2026-11-12,305,374!2027-06-19,499,406-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / lease liability treatment ::@:: Use the _effective-interest_ amortization method. <p> - Recognized at PV = \$43.3 million. <br/> - The liability is reduced over time by the principal portion of lease payments; interest expense is recognized on the remaining balance. <br/> - Year-1 interest: 5% × \$43.3 million = __\$2.165 million__. <br/> - Principal payment in year 1 = \$10 million – \$2.165 million = __\$7.835 million__, reducing the liability to \$35.465 million for year 2. <!--SR:!2027-06-01,485,406!2027-01-05,356,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / right-of-use asset treatment ::@:: - Also recognized at \$43.3 million \(net of any lease incentives or initial direct costs\). <br/> - Amortized \("depreciation" but for intangible assets\) on a straight-line basis \(other amortization methods may be used\) over the lease term: \$43.3 million ÷ 5 = __\$8.66 million per year__. <!--SR:!2027-06-14,496,406!2027-06-09,492,406-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / income statement impact ::@:: - Depreciation/amortization of ROU asset: \$8.66 million. <br/> - Interest expense on liability: \$2.165 million \(decreasing each subsequent year\). <br/> - Total lease cost in year 1: \$10.825 million, slightly higher than the pre-IFRS 16 operating expense due to the inclusion of interest. <!--SR:!2027-05-29,482,406!2027-01-20,353,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / cash flow statement impact ::@:: - Cash outflow remains \$10 million. <br/> - The principal portion \(\$7.835 million\) is reclassified from operating to financing activity; the interest component \(\$2.165 million\) stays in operating activities \(consistent with IAS 8 guidance on lease classification\). <!--SR:!2027-06-01,485,406!2027-06-05,487,406-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / balance sheet impact ::@:: - Increase in total assets by \$43.3 million \(ROU asset\). <br/> - Increase in total liabilities by \$43.3 million \(lease liability\), netting to zero change in equity directly from the lease. <!--SR:!2026-12-25,348,386!2027-06-14,495,406-->
    - IFRS 16 / example / Delta Airlines ::@:: Right-of-use assets totaled \$25.9 billion with lease liabilities of \$24.8 billion; annual payments averaged \$4.5 billion over 5–15 year terms at a weighted-average discount rate of 4.5%. <!--SR:!2027-08-14,545,406!2027-07-25,528,406-->
  - IFRS 16 / implementation steps ::@:: identify leases → recognize leases → amortize leases <!--SR:!2027-06-03,487,406!2026-11-09,302,386-->
    - IFRS 16 / implementation steps / identify leases ::@:: Identify all leases with terms &gt;12 months. <!--SR:!2027-04-16,439,394!2027-06-06,488,406-->
    - IFRS 16 / implementation steps / recognize leases ::@:: Compute PV of lease payments using the incremental borrowing rate or lessee's discount rate if it is more reflective of market conditions. Recognize ROU asset and liability at that PV; adjust for any lease incentives, initial direct costs, or residual value guarantees. \(There are several cases for adjustment, which will not be mentioned here.\) <!--SR:!2027-07-24,527,406!2027-08-04,537,406-->
    - IFRS 16 / implementation steps / amortize leases ::@:: Allocate depreciation/amortization over the lease term \(or shorter useful life if the asset's useful life is shorter\). Record interest expense on the lease liability using the effective-interest method each reporting period. <!--SR:!2026-11-13,306,374!2027-05-31,484,406-->
- [IFRS 2](../../../../general/IFRS%202.md) ::@:: It is an international financial reporting standard issued in February 2004 by the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\) to provide guidance on the accounting for share based payments. <p> Its purpose is to reflect the cost of awarding equity or equity based incentives to employees or other parties in exchange for goods or services. <!--SR:!2027-03-23,415,394!2027-03-10,390,386-->
  - IFRS 2 / pre-IFRS 2 ::@:: Prior to IFRS 2, ESOs were disclosed but not expensed, masking significant compensation costs. <!--SR:!2027-04-21,444,394!2027-06-29,507,406-->
  - IFRS 2 / example ::@:: Amazon recorded \$19.6 billion in stock-based compensation expense \(employee stock options \(ESOs\), restricted stock units \(RSUs\)\), valuing each option at a fair value of \$150 \(Black–Scholes model: volatility 30%, risk-free rate 3%, term 5 years\). <p> The requirement to recognize outflows of economic benefits and measure them at fair value ensures that the true cost of ESOs \(e.g. Amazon's net income reduced by 10–15% post-expensing\) is reflected in net income, ensuring relevance for investors and comparability across firms. <!--SR:!2027-03-16,394,386!2026-11-18,311,374-->
- financial accounting
  - financial accounting / conceptual framework
    - financial accounting / conceptual framework / examples ::@:: A \$1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 prize with 10&nbsp;000 tickets sold \(\$100 each\); secondary market price per ticket is \$90. A donor's \(who pays more than the issue price\) purchase of one ticket for \$150 raises questions about appropriate measurement—whether to record at issue price \(\$100\), fair value \(\$90\), or some other basis. <!--SR:!2027-07-16,522,406!2027-06-09,490,406-->
- [IFRS 9](../../../../general/IFRS%209.md) ::@:: It is an International Financial Reporting Standard \(IFRS\) published by the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\). It addresses the accounting for financial instruments. It contains three main topics: classification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. <!--SR:!2027-07-01,508,406!2027-08-06,539,406-->
  - IFRS 9 / history ::@:: The standard came into force on 1 January 2018, replacing the earlier IFRS for financial instruments, IAS 39. <!--SR:!2027-05-17,470,406!2027-04-14,437,394-->
  - IFRS 9 / example ::@:: Bank of America holds investment securities and loans, measured at fair value or amortized cost. <p> The framework provides criteria for measurement choice \(relevance vs. reliability\) and helps prevent asset overstatement during boom periods. <!--SR:!2026-12-25,348,386!2027-05-28,481,406-->
    - IFRS 9 / example / pre-IFRS 9 ::@:: During the 2008 crisis, BofA marked down mortgage-backed securities by \$60 billion \(from a book value of \$300 billion to a fair value of \$240 billion\), generating \$4.3 billion in losses. <!--SR:!2026-12-25,348,386!2027-08-06,539,406-->
    - IFRS 9 / example / post-IFRS 9 ::@:: In 2023, BofA classifies \$400 billion of debt securities at amortized cost \(held to collect cash flows\) and \$100 billion at fair value through profit or loss \(trading portfolio\), with a \$5 billion swing in earnings due to fair-value changes. <!--SR:!2027-06-10,492,406!2027-04-09,432,394-->

  - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics ::@:: For _decision making_: Fundamental qualities, which are more important and should be prioritized, are distinguished from enhancing qualities. <p> Cost constraint is part of the framework: How will costs of providing information be balanced against its benefits? <!--SR:!2027-06-29,506,406!2027-08-07,540,406-->
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / all ::@:: faithful representation, relevance; comparability, timeliness, understandability, verifiability <!--SR:!2027-03-22,414,394!2027-04-01,424,394-->

- topic: income statement; earnings management; earnings per share
- [income statement](../../../../general/income%20statement.md) ::@:: It is one of the financial statements of a company and shows the company's revenues and expenses during a particular period. <p> It indicates how the revenues \(also known as the _"top line"_\) are transformed into the net income or net profit \(the result after all revenues and expenses have been accounted for\). <!--SR:!2027-08-18,549,406!2026-12-12,335,386-->
  - income statement / purposes ::@:: - Provides a snapshot of a company's financial performance over a specific period. <br/> - Enables users to evaluate past results, forecast future earnings, and assess the risk associated with future cash-flow generation. <!--SR:!2027-08-09,541,406!2026-12-28,351,386-->
  - income statement / limitations ::@:: - Items that cannot be measured reliably are often omitted, which can skew the picture of profitability. <br/> - The choice of accounting methods \(e.g., revenue recognition, depreciation\) influences reported income figures. <br/> - Income measurement requires significant judgement; therefore, numbers may not fully reflect underlying economic reality. <!--SR:!2027-06-07,490,406!2027-06-27,505,406-->
- [earnings management](../../../../general/earnings%20management.md) ::@:: It, in accounting, is the act of intentionally influencing the process of financial reporting to obtain some private gain. <p> Companies sometimes time the recognition of revenues, expenses, gains or losses to meet earnings targets or to present a smoother profit trend. <!--SR:!2027-04-22,445,394!2027-06-29,508,406-->
  - earnings management / effects ::@:: When earnings are manipulated in this way, the resulting "quality" of earnings drops because the information becomes less useful for predicting future performance. <!--SR:!2027-07-11,518,406!2027-07-08,515,406-->
- income statement
  - income statement / elements ::@:: income \(revenues, gains\), expenses \(\(_ordinary_\) expenses, losses\) <!--SR:!2027-03-22,414,394!2027-05-25,478,406-->

    - income statement / elements / gains ::@:: increases in economic benefits that arise inside or outside routine operations \(e.g., sale of long-term assets, unrealised gains on trading securities\) <!--SR:!2027-08-01,535,406!2027-06-16,498,406-->
    - income statement / elements / expenses ::@:: outflows or depletions that reduce economic benefits, again excluding distributions to shareholders <p> may also refer to _ordinary_ expenses only, which arise from ordinary business activities \(cost of goods sold, depreciation, interest, salaries, taxes\) <!--SR:!2027-07-17,523,406!2027-07-28,531,406-->
    - income statement / elements / losses ::@:: reductions in equity from ordinary or non-ordinary activities \(e.g., restructuring charges, disposal losses, unrealised trading-security losses\) <!--SR:!2027-07-22,525,406!2027-07-04,511,406-->

    - income statement / components / gross profit ::@:: Calculated as Net Sales minus Cost of Goods Sold \(COGS\). The "Net" in Net Sales accounts for discounts, allowances, returns, etc. <p> A key indicator for evaluating operational efficiency and predicting future earnings. Industry benchmarks vary widely: e.g., Apple's gross margin was 46.7% in FY 2024, while Pfizer's exceeded 70%. <!--SR:!2027-07-23,526,406!2027-08-10,542,406-->

      - income statement / components / income before income tax / motivation ::@:: By removing the effect of tax policy, jurisdictional differences, and timing of tax settlements, income before tax offers a cleaner view of how well a company's core operations are performing. <p> It allows cross-company comparisons even when those companies operate in countries with vastly different statutory tax rates or have differing levels of deferred tax assets/liabilities. <!--SR:!2027-07-09,516,406!2027-06-21,501,406-->
    - income statement / components / income from continuing operations ::@:: It refers to the part of a company's business that is expected to keep operating into the future.

    - income statement / components / discontinued operations ::@:: Losses \(or gains\) from discontinued operations. As it is below the tax items, _tax effects_ of those losses/gains needs to be accounted for. <p> They are reported separately and often in a distinct section below income from continuing operations. The loss or gain on the disposal of the discontinued segment is shown, along with its tax impact. <!--SR:!2026-12-29,352,386!2027-06-08,490,406-->
    - income statement / components / net income ::@:: It is _the bottom line_: revenue minus all expenses, gains, and losses \(including discontinued operations\) for the period. Frequently regarded as the most critical measure of a company's success or failure over a given timeframe. <!--SR:!2026-12-30,353,386!2027-07-29,532,406-->
    - income statement / components / non-controlling interest ::@:: It represents the portion of a subsidiary's equity that is not owned by the parent company. It is also called "minority interest" when referring to shareholders who hold less than 50% of voting rights in a subsidiary. In consolidated financial statements, NCI ensures that all economic interests in the subsidiary are reported, not just those belonging to the parent. <!--SR:!2027-04-06,429,394!2027-08-12,544,406-->
      - income statement / components / non-controlling interest / effect ::@:: _Net income attributable to non-controlling interest_ is shown as a separate line item below \(or above\) earnings attributable to the parent. This figure equals the subsidiary's net income multiplied by the NCI ownership percentage. <!--SR:!2027-05-26,479,406!2027-07-09,515,406-->
    - income statement / components / earnings per share \(EPS\) ::@:: Calculated by dividing Net Income less _Preferred Dividends_ by the weighted-average number of _ordinary_ shares outstanding. Must appear prominently on the face of the income statement because it directly relates company performance to shareholder value. <p> Both _basic_ and _diluted_ EPS are reported. <!--SR:!2027-06-03,487,406!2027-01-10,361,386-->

      - income statement / components / earnings per share / diluted ::@:: It is a company's earnings per share calculated using fully diluted shares outstanding \(i.e. including the impact of stock option grants and convertible bonds\). <!--SR:!2027-06-19,499,406!2027-05-26,479,406-->
- [earnings per share](../../../../general/earnings%20per%20share.md) \(EPS\) ::@:: It is the monetary value of earnings per outstanding share of common stock for a company during a defined period of time, often a year. It is a key measure of corporate profitability, focusing on the interests of the company's owners \(shareholders\), and is commonly used to price stocks. <!--SR:!2027-07-06,514,406!2027-07-18,524,406-->
  - earnings per share / formula ::@:: earnings per share = ⁠\(net income − preferred dividends\) / weighted average common shares <!--SR:!2027-07-27,530,406!2027-05-23,476,406-->

- [comprehensive income](../../../../general/comprehensive%20income.md) ::@:: It is "the change in equity \[net assets\] of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners." <!--SR:!2027-06-01,485,406!2027-06-25,504,406-->
  - comprehensive income / components ::@:: It encompasses: <p> - All revenues, gains, expenses, and losses that appear in net income. <br/> - Other comprehensive income \(OCI\): Additional items that bypass net income but still affect equity \(e.g., unrealized gains/losses on certain securities, foreign-currency translation adjustments, pension and post-retirement benefit adjustments, cash-flow hedge gains/losses\). <!--SR:!2027-01-15,366,386!2026-11-17,310,374-->

    - comprehensive income / presentation / comprehensive income statement ::@:: It start with the net income. And then two sections called "items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss" and "items that will not be reclassified to profit and loss". Finally, sum appropriately to get the "other comprehensive income" and then "total comprehensive income". <p> If there is NCI, total comprehensive income, those attributable to majority interest, and those attribute to minority interest are reported separately. <!--SR:!2026-10-16,272,366!2026-12-28,351,386-->

    - Goldman Sachs / subprime mortgage crisis / analysis ::@:: The firm's balance sheet exposed it to a classic "liquidity-funding mismatch" amplified by high leverage and exposure to deteriorating mortgage assets. The 2008 crisis forced the firm to sell illiquid securities at steep discounts, absorb massive losses, and subsequently strengthen capital and liquidity buffers under new regulatory regimes. <!--SR:!2027-06-22,502,406!2027-06-02,484,406-->
- [Lehman Brothers](../../../../general/Lehman%20Brothers.md) ::@:: It was an American global financial services firm founded in 1850. Before filing for bankruptcy in 2008, Lehman was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States. <!--SR:!2027-07-21,525,406!2027-06-03,487,406-->
  - Lehman Brothers / subprime mortgage crisis ::@:: - As of Q2 2008, total assets were \$691 billion and liabilities \$668 billion \(including \$120 billion long-term debt\). <br/> - Equity stood at only \$23 billion, producing a staggering debt-to-equity ratio of roughly 29:1—well above the industry average of ~15:1 for banks. <br/> - EBIT barely covered interest expenses, giving an interest coverage ratio below one and signaling imminent distress that culminated in bankruptcy later that year. <!--SR:!2026-12-30,353,386!2027-07-16,522,406-->
    - Lehman Brothers / subprime mortgage crisis / analysis ::@:: The firm's balance sheet was a textbook case of "leverage-driven insolvency". A 29:1 debt-to-equity ratio, minimal interest coverage, and a heavy concentration in distressed mortgage assets left the firm unable to survive the sudden credit crunch, culminating in its historic bankruptcy. <!--SR:!2027-06-20,500,406!2026-12-11,334,386-->
- [Evergrande Group](../../../../general/Evergrande%20Group.md) ::@:: It is a defunct Chinese property development company.

  - Evergrande Group / Chinese property sector crisis ::@:: - The company reported assets of about ¥2.40 trillion \(~\$370 billion\), largely consisting of undeveloped land and unfinished properties, against liabilities of roughly ¥2.43 trillion \(~\$375 billion\). <br/> - Shareholders' equity turned negative by ~¥30 billion due to asset impairments and accumulated losses. <br/> - Net gearing \(debt-to-equity\) surged past 300% by mid-2021, far exceeding the regulatory cap of 100%; debt-to-assets reached roughly 85%, leaving minimal cushion for operating income to cover a $10 billion annual interest burden \(interest coverage &lt;0.5x\). <!--SR:!2027-06-26,505,406!2026-10-01,260,366-->
    - Evergrande Group / Chinese property sector crisis / analysis ::@:: The firm's balance sheet is a <!-- textbook --> case of "over-leverage with negative equity". The combination of high debt, illiquid land assets, inadequate cash flow, and tightening regulatory constraints left the company unable to meet its obligations, leading to a cascading default that has reverberated across China’s real-estate and financial markets. <!-- Might be inaccurate depending if the AI model contains this event in its training data... --> <!--SR:!2027-06-03,485,406!2026-11-11,304,374-->

  - DuPoint analysis / use cases ::@:: By examining each component, managers and investors can see whether ROE growth stems from improved profitability, smarter asset deployment, or increased leverage—and conversely identify where inefficiencies lie. <!--SR:!2026-07-31,229,366!2027-06-28,507,406-->
  - DuPoint analysis / interpretation ::@:: The DuPont model also highlights that an attractive ROE may be driven by high debt rather than genuine operational strength, underscoring the importance of balancing all three factors. <!--SR:!2027-06-18,498,406!2027-07-07,514,406-->

  - return on assets / peer analysis ::@:: We can compare ROA among companies in the same industry. Compared to ROE, leverage effect is ignored. <p> Tesla's ROA \(~2.96%\) is modest relative to peers like BYD \(~3.48%\) but higher than several Chinese EV players whose ROAs are negative or close to zero, which underscores early-stage losses or heavy capital outlays. <!--SR:!2026-04-17,150,420!2026-04-14,147,420-->

  - return on equity / peer analysis ::@:: We can compare ROE among companies in the same industry. Compared to ROA, leverage effect is reflected. <p> For example, comparing trailing-12-month \(TTM\) ratio for major automakers, Tesla's ~8.18% sits below Toyota and BYD, while BYD's extraordinary ~21.79% reflects high profitability and potentially greater leverage. Negative ROEs for newer entrants \(e.g., NIO, XPeng\) underscore early-stage losses or heavy capital outlays. <!--SR:!2026-04-07,141,420!2026-04-07,141,420-->

  - cash flow statement / categories ::@:: It provides accurate classification of cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities—categories that cannot be reliably derived from balance sheets alone. <!--SR:!2027-02-27,391,400!2026-02-20,102,400-->
  - cash flow statement / operating cash flows ::@:: Cash movements that result directly from the company's core revenue-generating activities—essentially the day-to-day operations that drive sales and expenses. <!--SR:!2026-04-14,147,419!2026-04-16,149,420-->
    - cash flow statement / operating cash flows / inflows ::@:: cash received from customers, interest or dividend income earned on operating assets <!--SR:!2026-02-25,106,400!2026-04-10,144,420-->
    - cash flow statement / operating cash flows / outflows ::@:: payments to suppliers, wages and salaries, taxes payable, and other operating expenses such as utilities and rent <!--SR:!2026-04-09,143,420!2026-03-06,108,399-->
  - cash flow statement / investing cash flows ::@:: Cash flows associated with the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and investments that are not part of normal trading operations <!--SR:!2026-04-11,144,420!2026-04-10,144,420-->
    - cash flow statement / investing cash flows / inflows ::@:: proceeds from selling property, plant & equipment (PPE) or securities; cash received from the sale of business units or subsidiaries <!--SR:!2026-04-11,144,420!2026-04-06,140,420-->
    - cash flow statement / investing cash flows / inflows ::@:: capital expenditures for new machinery or facilities, purchases of long-term investments, and payments made in acquiring another company's assets <!--SR:!2026-02-26,107,400!2026-02-28,108,399-->
  - cash flow statement / financing cash flows ::@:: Cash movements that arise from transactions with a firm's owners and creditors—essentially how the business raises or returns capital <!--SR:!2026-04-07,141,420!2026-04-06,140,419-->
    - cash flow statement / financing cash flows / inflows ::@:: proceeds from issuing debt \(bonds, loans\) or equity \(new shares\), as well as cash received from investors in capital contribution <!--SR:!2026-04-11,145,420!2026-04-12,145,420-->
    - cash flow statement / financing cash flows / outflows ::@:: repayment of principal on debt, dividend payments to shareholders, share buybacks, and other financing costs such as interest expense paid in cash <!--SR:!2026-04-15,148,420!2026-04-10,144,420-->
  - cash flow statement / methods ::@:: Under IFRS, the _indirect method_ is commonly employed. Standards encourage the _direct method_ for greater transparency but do not mandate it; and even when using the direct method, a separate reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating activities must be disclosed as required by IAS 7; hence, most entities present the indirect method only. <!--SR:!2026-04-05,139,420!2026-04-12,145,420-->
    - cash flow statement / methods / indirect method ::@:: Under IFRS, the indirect method is commonly employed: starting from net income \(after interests and tax\), adjustments are made for non-cash items \(depreciation, amortization\), reclassifications of gains/losses on asset sales or liability retirements, and changes in working capital components \(receivables, inventory, payables\). This reconciles accrual-based earnings to actual cash movement. <p> This is only used for _operating_ activities. The direct method is still used for investing and financing activities. <!--SR:!2026-04-09,143,420!2026-03-04,106,400-->
    - cash flow statement / methods / direct method ::@:: While the direct method reports gross cash receipts \(e.g., cash from customers\) minus cash payments \(e.g., to suppliers\), it is rarely used because it requires detailed transaction data not available in the two-balance-sheet approach. <p> Note the _actual_ amount of _cash_ is used. For example, if an investment of book value \$10&nbsp;000 was sold in cash with a loss of \$2&nbsp;000, record \$8&nbsp;000 for the sale in investing activities. <!--SR:!2026-04-09,143,420!2026-03-05,107,399-->
  - cash flow statement / presentation ::@:: The presentation using the direct and indirect method both have 3 sections in the following order: operating, investing, and financing activities, each section with a subtotal for the net change in cash. Then, the net change in cash and cash equivalents is summed from the three sections to show how cash balances move over the reporting period. Then, report the cash balance at the beginning of the period and at its close. \(Slight reasonable variations in the item ordering is okay.\) <!--SR:!2026-02-25,106,400!2026-04-10,144,420-->
    - cash flow statement / presentation / indirect method ::@:: Starts with net income and adjusts for non-cash items \(depreciation, amortization\), reclassifications \(gains/losses on asset sales\), and changes in working-capital accounts to arrive at operating cash flow. <p> Offers a convenient linkage between the income statement and balance sheet, making it easier for preparers to compute without detailed transaction data. <!--SR:!2026-04-08,142,420!2026-04-07,141,419-->
    - cash flow statement / presentation / direct method ::@:: Even when using the direct method, a separate reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating activities must be disclosed as required by IAS 7. <p> Presents _gross_ cash receipts and payments for each operating activity line item \(e.g., cash received from customers minus cash paid to suppliers\). <p> Provides a more transparent view of the actual cash flows without adjustments, allowing stakeholders to see how much cash was generated or used in specific operational transactions. <!--SR:!2026-02-26,107,400!2026-04-11,144,420-->
  - cash flow statement / indirect method ::@:: The indirect method reconstructs the statement of cash flows by starting with accrual-based earnings \(net income\) and systematically adjusting for all items that affect cash but are not reflected in the income statement, or those that are accounted for in investing or financing activities. <!--SR:!2026-03-17,113,410!2026-05-08,158,430-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / steps ::@:: 1. net income <br/> 2. non-cash items <br/> 3. reclassification <br/> 4. changes in working capital <br/> 5. operating cash flows <br/> 6. investing cash flows <br/> 7. financing cash flows <br/> 8. net change <br/> 9. reconciliation <!--SR:!2026-09-30,262,380!2026-11-23,295,380-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / net income ::@:: Begin with net income: Use the net profit figure from the most recent income statement as the starting point. Include interest and tax effects. <p> Some approaches start with the income before interest and tax, and present "cash generated from operations", which does not include interest and tax, and "net cash from operating activities" separately. <!--SR:!2026-02-23,104,400!2026-02-24,105,400-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / non-cash items ::@:: Add back non-cash expenses: Include depreciation, amortization, and other non-cash charges that reduced earnings but did not involve an actual cash outflow. <!--SR:!2026-04-09,143,420!2026-04-11,145,420-->
      - cash flow statement / indirect method / non-cash items / uncommon examples ::@:: deferred income taxes, digital assets \(gain\) loss, foreign currency transaction net unrealized \(gain\) loss, inventory write-downs, non-cash interest, other operating activities, stock-based compensation, etc. <!--SR:!2027-04-10,431,399!2027-03-03,395,400-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / reclassification ::@:: Subtract or add gains/losses on asset transactions \(investing\) or liability retirement \(financing\): Remove gains \(which inflated income as investing or financing activities\) from the operating section; add losses \(which reduced income as investing or financing activities\). <!--SR:!2027-02-15,379,399!2026-04-13,146,420-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / changes in working capital ::@:: - _Increase in non-cash current assets_ \(e.g., accounts receivable, inventory\): subtract the amount as it represents a use of cash. <br/> - _Decrease in non-cash current assets_: add the amount, indicating a release of cash. <br/> - _Increase in current liabilities_ \(e.g., accounts payable, accrued expenses\): add the amount, reflecting cash retained. <br/> - _Decrease in current liabilities_: subtract the amount, showing cash used to settle obligations. <!--SR:!2027-03-18,410,400!2026-03-01,109,399-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / operating cash flows ::@:: Calculate net cash provided by \(used in\) operating activities: Sum all adjustments from steps 2–4 with the net income to arrive at operating cash flow. <!--SR:!2026-04-15,148,420!2026-04-17,150,420-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / investing cash flows ::@:: Determine investing activity cash flow: Add cash proceeds \(use _actual_ received cash\) from sales of PPE or investments; subtract purchases \(use _actual_ used cash\) of PPE, new investments, and any acquisition costs. <p> Ignore cash flows due to ordinary tax \(e.g. tax on gain or loss, i.e. capital gain tax\), which are already accounted for in operating cash flows. Transaction-specific taxes \(e.g. VAT tax, sales tax\) are _not_ ignored, as they are part of the investment cost by the cost principle. <!--SR:!2027-03-25,417,400!2026-03-05,107,400-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / financing cash flows ::@:: Determine financing activity cash flow: Add proceeds \(use _actual_ received cash\) from issuing debt or equity; subtract repayments \(use _actual_ used cash\) of debt, dividends paid, share buybacks, and other financing outflows. <p> Ignore cash flows due to tax \(e.g. tax shield\), which are already accounted for in operating cash flows. <!--SR:!2026-03-03,105,400!2026-04-13,146,420-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / net change ::@:: Compute net change in cash and cash equivalents: Combine the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing sections to find the net increase or decrease in cash for the period. <!--SR:!2026-03-06,108,400!2026-03-06,108,400-->
    - cash flow statement / indirect method / reconciliation ::@:: Reconcile opening and closing cash balances: Add the opening cash balance to the net change calculated in step 8; verify that the result equals the closing cash balance reported on the balance sheet. <!--SR:!2026-04-17,150,420!2026-04-15,148,420-->
  - cash flow statement / required disclosures ::@:: The SCF must be accompanied by footnotes explaining non-cash events that affect cash \(e.g., issuing shares to buy assets, converting bonds into equity, or asset exchanges\). <!--SR:!2026-04-08,142,420!2026-04-10,144,420-->
  - cash flow statement / supplementary disclosures ::@:: cash paid for interest, cash paid for income taxes \(net of refunds\), etc. <!--SR:!2026-04-05,139,420!2026-04-08,142,419-->
  - cash flow statement / limitations ::@:: Although the indirect method simplifies preparation, it can overlook complex transactions such as business combinations, equity issuances, or off-balance-sheet items—making the final statement an approximation unless supplemented with detailed internal data. <!--SR:!2026-04-16,149,420!2026-04-09,143,419-->
  - cash flow statement / verifiability ::@:: Preparing a SCF obliges management to verify its accuracy and exposes them to auditor scrutiny, thereby reducing opportunities for classification manipulation \(e.g., moving cash flows between operating and financing\). <!--SR:!2026-03-04,112,399!2026-03-03,105,399-->
  - cash flow statement / comparability ::@:: By standardizing the presentation of cash movements, the SCF enhances comparability across firms, enabling investors and analysts to assess liquidity, operational efficiency, and capital-structure decisions more reliably. <!--SR:!2026-04-16,149,420!2026-04-13,146,419-->

- topic: cash and cash equivalents; accounts receivable; bad debt
- [cash and cash equivalents](../../../../general/cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents) \(CCE\) ::@:: They are the most liquid current assets found on a business's balance sheet. Cash equivalents are short-term commitments "with temporarily idle cash and easily convertible into a known cash amount". <!--SR:!2026-05-18,159,439!2026-05-17,158,439-->
  - cash and cash equivalents / nature ::@:: The most liquid asset; the base for measuring all other items. Classified as a current asset on the balance sheet. <!--SR:!2026-05-21,162,439!2026-05-13,155,439-->
  - cash and cash equivalents / examples ::@:: coins, currency, bank deposits (checking & savings), money orders, cashier's checks, personal checks, etc. <p> example: A firm's $10&nbsp;million in overnight bank balances is reported under "Cash" and used to settle obligations immediately. <!--SR:!2026-05-22,163,439!2026-05-17,158,439-->
  - cash and cash equivalents / cash equivalents ::@:: Short-term, highly liquid investments that can be converted into known cash amounts with insignificant risk of value change (maturity ≤&nbsp;3&nbsp;months). \(IAS 7\). <!--SR:!2026-05-16,157,439!2026-05-14,156,439-->
    - cash and cash equivalents / cash equivalents / cost method ::@:: Cash equivalents should be valued at amortized cost \(effective interest method\). <!--SR:!2026-05-10,152,439!2026-05-18,159,439-->
    - cash and cash equivalents / cash equivalents / presentation ::@:: Cash equivalents aggregate with cash on the balance sheet. <!--SR:!2026-05-10,152,439!2026-05-10,152,439-->
    - cash and cash equivalents / cash equivalents / examples ::@:: government bonds \(e.g. US Treasury bills\), commercial paper, money-market funds, etc. <p> example: A company holds \$2&nbsp;million of U.S. Treasury bills maturing in 60 days—reported as cash equivalents. <!--SR:!2026-05-19,160,439!2026-05-19,160,439-->
  - cash and cash equivalents / vs. short-term investments ::@:: Short-term \(maturity ≤&nbsp;1 year\) investments may be held for returns or trading; classified per IFRS 9 based on business model and expected cash-flow characteristics. They should be \(at least _moderately_\) liquid and have _moderate_ \(not _high_\) risk. <!--SR:!2026-05-14,156,439!2026-05-21,162,439-->
    - cash and cash equivalents / vs. short-term investments / classification ::@:: Cash equivalents are a subset that meet the liquidity \(maturity ≤&nbsp;3 months\) & risk criteria above. <p> example: A firm's \$5&nbsp;million in corporate bonds maturing in 12&nbsp;months \(&gt; 3 months\) is a short-term investment, not a cash equivalent. <!--SR:!2026-05-12,154,439!2026-05-11,153,439-->
    - cash and cash equivalents / vs. short-term investments / cost method ::@:: Short-term investments are valued per IFRS 9, either at amortized cost \(effective interest method\), fair value through other comprehensive income \(FVOCI\) if non-core business, or fair value through profit or loss \(FVTPL\) if core business. <!--SR:!2026-03-29,110,419!2026-05-17,158,439-->
    - cash and cash equivalents / vs. short-term investments / presentation ::@:: Short-term investments appear under "Investments", separately from "cash & cash equivalents". <!--SR:!2026-05-22,163,439!2026-05-22,163,439-->
  - cash and cash equivalents / cash equivalent
    - cash and cash equivalents / cash equivalent / vs. cash ::@:: Many firms mistakenly treated auction-rate notes as cash equivalents, arguing that their daily auctionability made them liquid and "risk-free". Auditors approved this classification even though the notes had maturities far beyond three months. <p> When the 2008 credit crunch halted auctions, the securities' values collapsed—revealing that the cash-equivalent treatment was misleading and demonstrating how seemingly harmless accounting choices can become disastrous in downturns. <!--SR:!2026-05-14,156,439!2026-05-10,152,439-->
  - cash and cash equivalents / vs. cryptocurrency ::@:: Its high price volatility breaches the "insignificant risk" requirement of IAS&nbsp;7, so it cannot be classified as a cash equivalent \("insignificant risk"\) or typical short-term investment \("moderate risk"\). <!--SR:!2026-05-21,162,439!2026-05-18,159,439-->
    - cash and cash equivalents / vs. cryptocurrency / classification ::@:: - Usually treated as an _intangible asset (IAS&nbsp;38)_: indefinite-lived, measured at cost less impairment \(impairment is tested annually\); no fair-value remeasurement. <br/> - If held for sale in the ordinary course of business, it can be classified as _inventory (IAS&nbsp;2)_ and measured at lower of _cost_ or _net realizable value_ \(LCNRV\). <!--SR:!2026-03-29,110,419!2026-03-29,110,419-->
    - cash and cash equivalents / vs. cryptocurrency / inventory ::@:: - _Commodity broker-traders_: Hold Bitcoin as inventory to resell; measure at fair value less selling costs, with gains/losses recognised in profit & loss. Gains/losses are considered operating activities \(core business\). <br/> - _Cryptocurrency miners_: Mine and sell Bitcoin shortly after acquisition; classify it as inventory because the sale is routine production for ordinary business. Gains/losses are considered investing activities \(non-core business\). <!--SR:!2026-05-18,159,439!2026-02-28,87,399-->
    - cash and cash equivalents / vs. cryptocurrency / examples ::@:: - In its 2020 consolidated statements, DigitalX Limited \(Australia\) listed digital assets as inventory under AASB&nbsp;8&nbsp;102 (equivalent to IAS&nbsp;2) because they were held for resale in the ordinary course of business. <br/> - Tesla held $1.5&nbsp;billion in Bitcoin, classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset \(US GAAP\) or as inventory under IAS&nbsp;2 if held for sale. Bitcoin is excluded from cash & cash equivalents under IFRS&nbsp;7. <!--SR:!2026-05-19,160,439!2026-04-03,114,419-->
  - cash and cash equivalents / restricted cash ::@:: Cash set aside for specific purposes (plant expansion, long-term debt repayment, _compensating balances_). <p> \(_Compensating balance_ is a minimum amount of funds a borrower must keep in a bank account as a condition of a loan or line of credit.\) <!--SR:!2026-05-17,158,439!2026-05-16,157,439-->
    - cash and cash equivalents / restricted cash / classification ::@:: Classified as current or non-current depending on the availability date. Still qualifies as a cash equivalent if liquid and available within three months; disclosed separately in notes. <p> example: Tesla's \$898&nbsp;million restricted cash (494&nbsp;m current, 404&nbsp;m non-current) is shown under "Cash & cash equivalents" but noted for lease and credit-card program collateral. <!--SR:!2026-03-29,110,419!2026-05-13,155,439-->
    - cash and cash equivalents / restricted cash / disclosure ::@:: GAAP requires separate disclosure in the notes or reconciliation in the statement of cash flows to ensure transparency about usability. <!--SR:!2026-05-10,152,439!2026-05-11,153,439-->
  - cash and cash equivalents / bank overdrafts ::@:: Occur when a check exceeds the available balance; usually presented as a _current liability_. <!--SR:!2026-05-21,162,439!2026-05-13,155,439-->
    - cash and cash equivalents / bank overdrafts / classification ::@:: If repayable on demand and integral to cash management (e.g. _offsetting arrangements_), can be netted against cash and shown within "Cash & cash equivalents". <p> example: E.F. Hutton's 1980s check-kiting inflated reported cash balances; the scheme used overdrafts to fund short-term Treasury bills, violating faithful representation. <!--SR:!2026-05-11,153,439!2026-05-09,151,439-->
    - cash and cash equivalents / bank overdrafts / examples ::@:: E.F. Hutton systematically check-kited inflated reported liquidity by creating fictitious cash through interbank overdrafts. <p> Led to overstated operating and investing activities on the statement of cash flows; highlighted the need for rigorous bank confirmations during audit. <!--SR:!2026-05-17,158,439!2026-05-13,155,439-->
- [accounts receivable](../../../../general/accounts%20receivable.md) \(AR\) ::@:: They are legally enforceable claims for payment held by a business for goods supplied or services rendered that customers have ordered but not paid for. <!--SR:!2026-05-10,152,439!2026-05-13,155,439-->
  - accounts receivable / examples ::@:: postdated checks, IOUs, travel advances, etc. <p> Postage on hand \(as stamps or in postage meters\) are considered _prepaid expenses_ or _office supplies_. <!--SR:!2026-05-14,156,439!2026-05-19,160,439-->
  - accounts receivable / nature ::@:: Informal credit extended to customers; typically interest-free and collected within 30–60 days. <!--SR:!2026-05-18,159,439!2026-05-14,156,439-->
  - accounts receivable / transaction ::@:: Recorded at net realizable value with an allowance for doubtful accounts. <p> example: Lululemon sells a yoga outfit on account; recognizes revenue and AR simultaneously. <!--SR:!2026-05-20,161,439!2026-05-14,156,439-->
  - accounts receivable / costing method ::@:: Recorded at net realizable value \(NRV\), using allowance for doubtful accounts for uncollectibles. <!--SR:!2026-05-19,160,439!2026-05-16,157,439-->
  - accounts receivable / notes receivable \(NR\) ::@:: Formal written promises to pay, often including interest and specified maturity dates. Can be short-term or long-term; usually larger in amount and may be secured by collateral. <!--SR:!2026-05-16,157,439!2026-05-15,157,439-->
    - accounts receivable / notes receivable / costing method ::@:: Recorded at face value if the term is _not_ longer than one year and the face value can be assumed fair \(see "fairness" below\); otherwise, recorded at present \(discounted\) value of interest payments and the final repayment. <!--SR:!2026-05-18,159,439!2026-02-25,84,399-->
  - accounts receivable / non-trade receivables ::@:: Generally unsecured and arise from non-sales activities. <!--SR:!2026-05-13,155,439!2026-05-19,160,439-->
    - accounts receivable / examples ::@:: Advances to officers/subsidiaries, deposits for potential damages, dividends/interest receivable, claims against defendants, insurers, or governments, etc. <p> example: A company holds a \$500&nbsp;k deposit as a guarantee for a vendor program. <!--SR:!2026-02-27,86,399!2026-04-03,114,419-->
  - accounts receivable / transaction
    - accounts receivable / transaction / transaction price ::@:: The amount expected to be received in exchange for goods/services. May include variable consideration such as discounts, returns, allowances, rebates, and performance bonuses. <!--SR:!2026-05-19,160,439!2026-05-18,159,439-->
    - accounts receivable / transaction / effective interest rate ::@:: Treat the rate as _simple_ interest: $$\text{Effective interest rate} = \frac{\text{Cash discount} }{\text{discount period}/365}$$ <p> example: A 2/10, n/30 term offers a 2% cash discount if paid within 10 days; the implied effective rate is about \(0.02/(20/365)=36.5\%\). <!--SR:!2026-05-09,151,439!2026-02-22,82,399-->
  - accounts receivable / trade discounts ::@:: Reduce invoice price to avoid frequent catalog changes, to reward bulk purchases, or to hide the true invoice price from competitors. <p> Recorded at net of the discount; no separate expense recognized. <!--SR:!2026-05-12,154,439!2026-05-09,151,439-->
  - accounts receivable / sales discounts ::@:: Incentives for early payment. <p> Two methods to record: _gross method_, _net method_. <!--SR:!2026-05-22,163,439!2026-05-13,155,439-->
    - accounts receivable / sales discounts / terms ::@:: A typical term such as "2/10, n/30" means the buyer can take a 2% discount if payment is made within 10 days; otherwise the full amount is due in 30 days. <!--SR:!2026-05-14,156,439!2026-05-09,151,439-->
    - accounts receivable / gross method ::@:: Assume the discount is not taken when recording AR. <p> Record gross records receivable at face value. If discount is taken, recognize discount by debiting to a separate income item "_Sales Discounts_". <!--SR:!2026-05-19,160,439!2026-05-10,152,439-->
    - accounts receivable / net method ::@:: Assume the discount is taken when recording AR. <p> Record receivable at cash-realizable amount and includes discount in revenue. If discount is not taken, later credited from "_Sales Discounts Forfeited_". <!--SR:!2026-04-05,116,419!2026-03-29,110,419-->
  - accounts receivable / returns and allowances ::@:: Expected product returns or price adjustments are estimated at the time of sale or at the start of a period. <!--SR:!2026-05-16,157,439!2026-05-15,157,439-->
    - accounts receivable / returns and allowances / transaction ::@:: A "_return liability_" \(RL\) is credited at the same time the sales revenue \(SR\) and AR is recorded; granting allowances credits RL and debits AR further. <p> When the actual cash is received, remove the effect of the sale on AR. Debit _cash_ using actual received cash and use RL to _balance_ the transaction. This satisfies that IFRS requires estimates to be constrained so that downward adjustments of SR are highly unlikely. <!--SR:!2026-04-05,116,419!2027-04-25,431,419-->
    - accounts receivable / returns and allowances / estimation ::@:: If expected returns or price adjustments are estimated at the start of a period, debit "_Sales Returns and Allowances_" and credit "_Return Liability_" instead, as there is no "_Sales Revenue_" associated with a sale. <!--SR:!2026-05-10,152,439!2026-05-13,155,439-->
  - accounts receivable / footnotes ::@:: The footnote must describe how the entity evaluates its receivables for expected credit losses and maintains an allowance that reduces the gross balance to a net realizable value it believes will be collected. <p> It should also cover how the allowance is monitored and adjusted. <!--SR:!2026-05-19,160,439!2026-05-15,157,439-->
    - accounts receivable / footnotes / evaluation ::@:: The footnote must describe how the entity evaluates its receivables for expected credit losses and maintains an allowance that reduces the gross balance to a net realizable value it believes will be collected. <p> It should explain the methodology—typically the _expected-credit-loss model_—and list the key indicators used, such as the aging of balances, payment history, customers' creditworthiness and financial condition, and industry trends. These factors feed into reasonable forecasts that determine the allowance percentage applied to each receivable. <!--SR:!2026-05-12,154,439!2026-05-17,158,439-->
    - accounts receivable / footnotes / monitoring ::@:: The disclosure should also cover how the allowance is monitored and adjusted: periodic reviews are performed whenever there are significant differences between estimated losses and actual write-offs, leading to a recalibration of the allowance rate. <p> When evidence indicates a specific receivable is unlikely to be recovered, a separate provision for that loss is recorded in the same period when the loss becomes probable. <p> Finally, it should state that balances are written off only after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted and that such write-offs reduce both the receivable balance and the allowance account. <!--SR:!2026-05-16,157,439!2026-05-21,162,439-->
- [bad debt](../../../../general/bad%20debt.md) ::@:: It is a monetary amount owed to a creditor that is unlikely to be paid and for which the creditor is not willing to take action to collect for various reasons, often due to the debtor not having the money to pay, for example due to a company going into liquidation or insolvency. <!--SR:!2026-05-14,156,439!2026-05-12,154,439-->
  - bad debt / examples ::@:: JD.com uses a "buy now, pay later" platform (Baitiao) that extends credit without collateral. <p> Bad debt provisioning follows IFRS&nbsp;9: simplified lifetime expected credit loss \(ECL\) for trade receivables and general approach for consumer loans; aging matrices adjusted for economic conditions. <!--SR:!2026-05-09,151,439!2026-05-16,157,439-->
  - bad debt / expected credit loss ::@:: It is the expected _future_ bad debt given the current account receivables. There are two models: _simplified_ and _general_. <!--SR:!2026-05-14,156,439!2026-05-10,152,439-->
    - bad debt / expected credit loss / simplified ECL ::@:: Under IFRS&nbsp;9, trade receivables are required to apply the __simplified ECL model__, which estimates a _lifetime_ expected credit loss. This means that from the first day of recognition, an entity must assess all probable future defaults over the remaining life of the receivable, regardless of when the default is likely to occur. The calculation uses historical loss experience, current conditions and reasonable forecasts of economic factors (e.g., GDP growth or unemployment rates) but does not require a detailed 12-month forecast; it captures the full lifetime risk in a single line item. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,87,399!2026-02-27,86,399-->
    - bad debt / expected credit loss / general ECL ::@:: In contrast, consumer loans fall under the __general ECL model__. Here, an entity must first determine whether credit risk has increased since initial recognition. If no increase is identified, only a 12-month expected loss is required. Once credit risk has risen, the entity moves to a lifetime loss estimate. <!--SR:!2026-05-20,161,439!2026-05-12,154,439-->
  - bad debt / provisioning matrix ::@:: Companies such as JD.com typically implement a _provisioning matrix_ that blends aging buckets with historical default rates and adjusts for current economic conditions, ensuring that bad-debt expense reflects both past experience and forward-looking risk factors while reducing receivables on the balance sheet via an allowance account. <!--SR:!2026-05-18,159,439!2026-05-19,160,439-->
  - bad debt / direct writeoff method ::@:: When an account is deemed uncollectible, the bad debt expense is debited directly. <p> Simpler but does not match expenses with revenues \(e.g. What should happen if the written-off amount is later recovered?\) and fails to present receivables at cash-realizable value; generally only acceptable for immaterial amounts. <!--SR:!2026-05-13,155,439!2026-05-21,162,439-->
  - bad debt / allowance method ::@:: Mandated by IFRS 9 when amounts are material. <p> The allowance is recorded as a credit balance \(normal balance: credit\) against receivables \(normal balance: debit balance\) when writeoff happens. <p> When period-end adjustment happens, the expense entry is _Bad Debt Expense_, which is used to adjust the allowance account to match the _future_ expected uncollectible amount. <!--SR:!2026-03-29,110,419!2026-05-09,151,439-->
    - bad debt / allowance method / estimation ::@:: Uses past loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts of future collectability. <!--SR:!2026-05-21,162,439!2026-05-15,157,439-->
      - bad debt / allowance method / estimation / methods ::@:: percentage-of-sales, percentage-of-receivables; optionally with an _aging schedule_ <!--SR:!2026-05-13,155,439!2026-05-25,165,445-->
    - bad debt / allowance method / writeoff ::@:: When an account is deemed uncollectible, it is written off by debiting the allowance \(not the expense\) and crediting the specific AR account. <!--SR:!2026-05-15,157,439!2026-05-10,152,439-->
    - bad debt / allowance method / examples ::@:: - Credit sales: £1&nbsp;800&nbsp;k; estimated uncollectibles: £10&nbsp;k. <br/> - Entry to establish allowance: $$\begin{aligned} & \text{Bad Debt Expense} & 10\,000 && \\ & \quad \text{Allowance for Doubtful Accounts} & && 10\,000 \end{aligned}$$ <br/> - Net receivables on the balance sheet become £1&nbsp;790&nbsp;k (i.e., 1&nbsp;800&nbsp;k – 10&nbsp;k). <!--SR:!2026-05-11,153,439!2026-05-17,158,439-->
    - bad debt / allowance method / recovery ::@:: If a previously written-off amount is recovered, the allowance is debited and cash (or bank) credited; essentially, reverse of writeoff plus receiving cash; the recovery is recorded as a _gain_ in income. <!--SR:!2026-03-29,110,419!2026-05-12,154,439-->
    - bad debt / allowance method / aging schedule ::@:: It groups accounts receivable into buckets based on how many days they have been outstanding (e.g., 0-30&nbsp;days, 31-60&nbsp;days, 61-90&nbsp;days, >&nbsp;90&nbsp;days). For each bucket, an entity applies a historically derived allowance percentage—often higher for older or more delinquent accounts—to estimate the dollar amount likely to be uncollectible. <p> The sum of these bucket estimates forms the total allowance for doubtful accounts; this figure is then recorded as bad-debt expense and reduces receivables on the balance sheet, ensuring that the reported carrying value reflects expected realizable cash. <!--SR:!2026-04-04,115,419!2026-04-04,115,419-->
    - bad debt / allowance method / over-allowance ::@:: If in the unlikely case that at year end the allowance account has a credit amount larger than the expected credit loss, simply credit "_Bad Debt Expense_". <!--SR:!2026-05-13,155,439!2026-05-22,163,439-->

- [questions § week 5 lecture 2](questions.md#week%205%20lecture%202)
- bad debt
  - bad debt / direct writeoff method
  - bad debt / allowance method
    - bad debt / allowance method / writeoff
    - bad debt / allowance method / recovery
    - bad debt / allowance method / T-account ::@:: Possible T-accounts needed: A/R begins with sales, then collections, write-offs, recoveries, ending at net balance. <!--SR:!2026-05-20,161,439!2026-05-21,162,439-->
    - bad debt / allowance method / examples
- [notes receivable](../../../../general/notes%20receivable.md) \(NR\) ::@:: They represents claims for which formal instruments of credit are issued as evidence of debt, such as a promissory note. The credit instrument normally requires the debtor to pay interest and extends for time periods of 30 days or longer. <!--SR:!2026-03-29,110,419!2026-05-20,161,439-->
  - notes receivable / classification ::@:: Notes receivable are considered current assets if they are to be paid within one year, and non-current if they are expected to be paid after one year. <!--SR:!2026-05-20,161,439!2026-05-12,154,439-->
  - notes receivable / features ::@:: A promissory note is a _formal promise_ to pay a specified amount at a future date; it is negotiable and may bear interest (stated coupon) or be zero-interest. <!--SR:!2026-05-11,153,439!2026-05-16,157,439-->
  - notes receivable / rate ::@:: Stated rate = coupon; market rate = effective (discount) rate used to compute present value (PV). <!--SR:!2026-05-18,159,439!2026-05-19,160,439-->
- [time value of money](../../../../general/time%20value%20of%20money.md) ::@:: It refers to the fact that there is normally a greater benefit to receiving a sum of money now rather than an identical sum later. It may be seen as an implication of the later-developed concept of time preference. <!--SR:!2026-05-19,160,439!2026-05-16,157,439-->
  - time value of money / present value ::@:: Move the cash flow backward in time: $PV = \frac {FV} {(1 + r)^t}$, where $t$ is the number of time periods backwards (beware of off-by-one error). <!--SR:!2026-05-17,158,439!2026-05-20,161,439-->
- [perpetuity](../../../../general/perpetuity.md) ::@:: It is an annuity that has no end, or a stream of cash payments that continues forever. <!--SR:!2026-05-10,152,439!2026-05-20,161,439-->
  - perpetuity / intuition ::@:: You want to earn $C$ at the end of each year forever (excluding year 0). <p> Assuming the interest rate $r$ is fixed. Then you need to invest $P = C / r$ at year 0. This $P$ is also how one calculates the present value of a perpetuity. <!--SR:!2026-05-17,158,439!2026-05-13,155,439-->
  - perpetuity / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = C / r$$ <p> This equation assumes the first payment is at first year end. Multiply by $1 + r$ if the first payment is at first year start, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period. <!--SR:!2026-05-18,159,439!2026-05-11,153,439-->
  - perpetuity / present value ::@:: Notice that the present value is always the same when evaluated at any time. <!--SR:!2026-05-11,153,439!2026-05-19,160,439-->
- [annuity](../../../../general/annuity.md) ::@:: It is a series of payments made at equal intervals. <!--SR:!2026-05-15,157,439!2026-05-12,154,439-->
  - annuity / types ::@:: ordinary annuity: payment is made at period end, annuity due: payment is made at period start <!--SR:!2026-05-12,154,439!2026-05-15,157,439-->
  - annuity / relation to perpetuity ::@:: You can interpret as an annuity as a perpetuity that you transfer away to others for free at annuity end (after getting the cash flow for annuity end). <p> This gives the equation for an annuity directly by subtracting the PV of the perpetuity at annuity end from the PV of perpetuity at annuity start. <!--SR:!2026-05-22,163,439!2026-05-12,154,439-->
  - annuity / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = \frac C r \left(1 - \frac 1 {(1 + r)^t} \right) \,,$$ where $t$ is the number of periods. <p> This equation assumes the annuity is an ordinary annuity. For annuity due, multiply by $1 + r$, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period. <!--SR:!2026-05-20,161,439!2026-05-12,154,439-->
- notes receivable
  - notes receivable / rate
    - notes receivable / rate / same as market rate ::@:: Bigelow SA lends €10&nbsp;000 at a 10% coupon, market rate also 10%. <p> - Receipt entry: debit "Notes Receivable" and credit "Cash" by the _face value_. <br/> - Annual interest revenue (coupon × FV): €1&nbsp;000 recorded as Cash \(debit\) and Interest _Revenue_ \(credit\). \(Reverse debit and credit and fix the account names \(e.g. Interest _Expense_\) if you are the borrower.\) <!--SR:!2026-05-18,159,439!2026-02-19,79,399-->
    - notes receivable / rate / zero coupon rate ::@:: Jeremiah Company receives a $10&nbsp;000 note with zero stated rate \(_not_ no rate stated\); market rate = 9%. <p> <!--SR:!2026-05-11,153,439!2026-05-22,163,439-->
    - Implicit rate solves PV = \$7&nbsp;721.80 \(present value of all cash flows\), so entry at receipt is: debit "Notes Receivable" and credit "Cash" by the PV. <br/> - Effective-interest amortization: Year 1 interest revenue credit = $7&nbsp;721.80 × 0.09 = $694.96, increasing the book value to $8&nbsp;416.76.
    - notes receivable / rate / different from market rate ::@:: Morgan Group lends €10&nbsp;000 at a 10% coupon while market rate is 12%. <p> - Receipt entry records the note at PV = €9&nbsp;520 (discount of €480; based on present value of all cash flows): debit "Notes Receivable" and credit "Cash" by the PV. <br/> - First-year journal: Cash debit €1&nbsp;000 calculated using _face value_ and _stated rate_, interest revenue credit €1&nbsp;142 (includes €142 amortization of discount) calculated using _book value_ \(PV\) and market rate, increasing the book value to €9&nbsp;662. <!--SR:!2026-05-16,157,439!2026-04-03,114,419-->
    - notes receivable / rate / fairness ::@:: If a note is received in exchange for goods or property at arm's length, the stated rate is presumed fair \(that is, can be used to find the present value of the note coupled with the market rate\) unless: (i) no rate stated, (ii) rate unreasonable, or (iii) face amount materially differs from fair value. <!--SR:!2026-03-29,110,419!2026-05-17,158,439-->
      - notes receivable / rate / fairness / examples ::@:: Oasis Development sells land \($14&nbsp;000 cost, $20&nbsp;000 fair market value\) to Rusty Pelican and receives a 5-year note for $35&nbsp;247 with no stated rate. <p> - The note is recorded at fair market value: debit \$20&nbsp;000 to "Notes Receivable". <br/> - Land cost = $14&nbsp;000, so a gain of $6&nbsp;000 is recognized immediately: credit from "Land" \(\$14&nbsp;000\) and "Gain on Sale of Land" \($6&nbsp;000\). <!--SR:!2026-03-20,68,419!2026-05-20,161,439-->

- topic:
- notes receivable
  - notes receivable / rate
    - notes receivable / rate / fairness
      - notes receivable / rate / fairness / examples
- accounts receivable
  - accounts receivable / derecognition ::@:: - A receivable is removed from the balance sheet when it loses all value (i.e., contractual rights to cash flows no longer exist), e.g. bad debt. <br/> - Transfer of a receivable to another party that assumes all risks and rewards \(assuming all risks and rewards is _important_\) also triggers derecognition under ASC&nbsp;860. <!--SR:!2026-05-10,152,439!2026-05-18,159,439-->
- [factoring](../../../../general/factoring%20(finance).md) ::@:: It is a financial transaction and a type of debtor finance in which a business _sells_ its accounts receivable (i.e., invoices) to a third party (called a factor) at a discount. <!--SR:!2026-05-14,156,439!2026-05-21,162,439-->
  - factoring / examples ::@:: - __Procter & Gamble (P&G)__ – uses non-recourse factoring on a revolving basis, thereby derecognizing the receivables under ASC&nbsp;860 and improving cash flow against its \$84&nbsp;billion in net sales. <br/> - __Ford Motor Company__ – pledges automotive finance receivables to Ford Credit subsidiary as collateral for secured borrowing; since Ford retains control and credit risk, the receivables stay on the balance sheet while a liability is recorded. <!--SR:!2026-03-30,117,419!2026-05-20,161,439-->
  - factoring / motivation ::@:: A business will sometimes factor its receivable assets to meet its present and immediate cash needs. <p> Companies transfer receivables mainly to accelerate cash, improve liquidity, reduce collection costs, or respond to competitive pressures. <!--SR:!2026-05-12,154,439!2026-05-12,154,439-->
  - factoring / types ::@:: sales of receivables, secured borrowing <!--SR:!2026-05-22,163,439!2026-05-14,156,439-->
    - factoring / types / sales of receivables ::@:: The seller may provide a guarantee (seller still bears credit risk, derecognition does not happen) or sell without guarantee (purchaser assumes all risk). <!--SR:!2026-05-21,162,439!2026-05-10,152,439-->
    - factoring / types / secured borrowing ::@:: The company uses its receivables as collateral for a loan, retaining collection rights and the associated risks. <!--SR:!2026-05-17,158,439!2026-05-11,153,439-->
  - factoring / secured borrowing ::@:: The company uses its receivables as collateral for a loan, retaining collection rights and the associated risks. <p> There may be _finance charge_ that reduces the amount of money received, which may be considered as _finance charge_ or _interest expense_ \(and considered as _interest revenue_ only for the bank\). <!--SR:!2026-05-11,153,439!2026-03-29,110,419-->
    - factoring / secured borrowing / transactions ::@:: When using receivables as a collateral, there are no major difference to the required journal entries compared to that for a normal loan \(notes payable\). <!--SR:!2026-03-29,110,419!2026-05-18,159,439-->
    - factoring / secured borrowing / remittance ::@:: Sometimes, the bank requires the company to make monthly payments on all or some of the collections. <p> In that case, the _actual cash_ received on the AR is used to repay the _principal_. The _interest_ is still paid separately with additional cash. <p> \(Assume rates are simple when calculating interest.\) <!--SR:!2026-05-11,153,439!2026-05-09,151,439-->
  - factoring / sales of receivables ::@:: Factoring involves selling receivables to a factor for an upfront fee; the buyer _may_ or _may not_ assume collection risk. <!--SR:!2026-03-28,115,419!2026-05-16,157,439-->
    - factoring / sales of receivables / without guarantee ::@:: The factor bears all collection risk \(so the AR is _fully_ transferred to the factor/buyer\); the seller records any loss and may maintain a "_due from factor_" \("_due to customer_" for the factor\) account for anticipated discounts or returns. \(Questions use the verb "retains" as in "\[factor\] retains" to indicate anticipated discounts or returns.\) <!--SR:!2026-03-27,114,419!2026-04-04,115,419-->
      - factoring / sales of receivables / without guarantee / example for seller ::@:: Crest Textiles sells €500&nbsp;000 A/R to Commercial Factors, pays a 3% finance charge \($0.03 \times 500\,000 = \texteuro 15\,000$\) and reserves 5% \(€25&nbsp;000\) for adjustments. <p> For the seller: Debit "_Cash_" \(92%\), "_Due from Factor_" \(5%\), and "_Loss on Sale of Receivables_" \(3%\). Credit "_Accounts Receivable_" \(100%\). <!--SR:!2026-02-25,84,399!2026-02-24,83,399-->
      - factoring / sales of receivables / without guarantee / example for buyer ::@:: Crest Textiles sells €500&nbsp;000 A/R to Commercial Factors, pays a 3% finance charge \($0.03 \times 500\,000 = \texteuro 15\,000$\) and reserves 5% \(€25&nbsp;000\) for adjustments. <p> For the buyer: Debit "_Accounts Receivable_" \(100%\). Credit "_Cash_" \(92%\), "_Due to Customer_" \(5%\), and "_Interest Revenue_" \(3%\). <!--SR:!2026-05-21,162,439!2026-05-19,160,439-->
    - factoring / sales of receivables / with guarantee ::@:: The factor is guaranteed payment from the seller \(so the AR is _not fully_ transferred to the factor/buyer\); the seller records this as a _liability_ \(similar to borrowing\). The seller still records any loss and may maintain a "_due from factor_" \("_due to customer_" for the factor\) account for anticipated discounts or returns. <!--SR:!2026-05-15,157,439!2026-03-29,116,419-->
      - factoring / sales of receivables / with guarantee / example for seller ::@:: Crest Textiles sells €500&nbsp;000 A/R to Commercial Factors, pays a 3% finance charge \($0.03 \times 500\,000 = \texteuro 15\,000$\) and reserves 5% (€25&nbsp;000) for adjustments. <p> For the seller: Debit "_Cash_" \(92%\), "_Due from Factor_" \(5%\), and "_Loss on Sale of Receivables_" \(3%\). Credit "_Recourse Liability_" \(100%\). <p> The only difference is a liability instead of an asset is credited. <!--SR:!2026-05-11,153,439!2026-02-21,81,399-->
      - factoring / sales of receivables / with guarantee / example for buyer ::@:: Crest Textiles sells €500&nbsp;000 A/R to Commercial Factors, pays a 3% finance charge \($0.03 \times 500\,000 = \texteuro 15\,000$\) and reserves 5% (€25&nbsp;000) for adjustments. <p> For the buyer: Actually, the transactions are the same as above _without guarantee_. <!--SR:!2026-05-18,159,439!2026-03-29,110,419-->
- [receivables turnover ratio](../../../../general/receivables%20turnover%20ratio.md) ::@:: $$\frac {\text{net credit sales} } {\text{average net trade accounts receivables} }$$ Average net trade accounts receivable is not time-weighted, it is simply the average of the beginning and the ending balance. The adjective _net_ means discounts and allowances need to be removed. <p> "Net credit sales" may be "net sales" in practice, since net credit sales are normally not reported separately. <!--SR:!2026-05-19,160,439!2026-05-13,155,439-->
  - [receivables turnover ratio](../../../../general/receivables%20turnover%20ratio.md) / interpretation ::@:: It measures how many times average receivables are recorded and collected for the year. <p> A higher ratio benefits the company because it can collect the money earlier for investment. It is related to how generous payment schedules are. A sudden decline in the ratio may mean a company is extending payment deadlines to prop up lagging sales or recording bad sales. <!--SR:!2026-05-21,162,439!2026-05-17,158,439-->
  - receivables turnover ratio / average collection period ::@:: $$\frac {365} {\text{receivables turnover ratio} }$$ <p> It indicates the average time it takes for customer to pay its accounts. The unit is in days. <p> Remember to benchmark this period against the credit period. <!--SR:!2026-05-21,162,439!2026-05-15,157,439-->
  - receivables turnover ratio / factoring ::@:: Factoring \(without guarantee\) reduces the ending balance of _trade_ receivables without affecting other numbers, so this ratio is increased. <!--SR:!2026-05-15,157,439!2026-05-22,163,439-->

- topic: inventory; perpetual inventory; periodic inventory; consignment; repurchase agreement; inventory returns
- [inventory](../../../../general/inventory.md) ::@:: It is a quantity of the goods and materials that a business holds for the ultimate goal of resale, production or utilisation. <p> Inventories are assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business or to be used in production. <!--SR:!2026-05-14,156,439!2026-05-14,156,439-->
  - inventory / merchandising company ::@:: On the balance sheet, these companies consolidate all inventory types into one "Inventory" account, which is reported as a current asset. <p> The single account simplifies disclosure but requires detailed sub-ledger tracking for internal control. <!--SR:!2026-05-20,161,439!2026-05-22,163,439-->
  - inventory / manufacturing company ::@:: Each category reflects a different stage of the manufacturing process and is treated separately in cost flow calculations: raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. Some companies also include an inventory for _service parts_, e.g. Tesla. <!--SR:!2026-05-17,158,439!2026-05-12,154,439-->
  - inventory / methods ::@:: periodic inventory, perpetual inventory <!--SR:!2026-05-09,151,439!2026-05-09,151,439-->
- [perpetual inventory](../../../../general/perpetual%20inventory.md) ::@:: It describes systems of inventory where information on inventory quantity and availability is updated on a continuous/real-time basis as a function of doing business. <!--SR:!2026-05-17,158,439!2026-05-09,151,439-->
  - perpetual inventory / overview ::@:: Every purchase, sale, and adjustment updates the Inventory and COGS accounts in real time; subsidiary ledgers track quantity and cost per item. <!--SR:!2026-05-17,158,439!2026-05-12,154,439-->
- [periodic inventory](../../../../general/periodic%20inventory.md) ::@:: It is a system of inventory in which updates are made on a periodic basis. This differs from perpetual inventory systems, where updates are made as seen fit. <!--SR:!2026-05-09,151,439!2026-05-11,153,439-->
  - periodic inventory / overview ::@:: Purchases of inventory are recorded only in a _Purchases_ account; ending inventory is determined by physical count, and COGS = Beginning + Purchases – Ending. <p> On sale, the sale entry is added without the corresponding COGS entry. <p> "_Inventory over and short_" cannot be identified. <!--SR:!2026-05-22,163,439!2026-05-22,163,439-->
- perpetual inventory
  - perpetual inventory / examples ::@:: - Amazon uses RFID and warehouse-management software to automatically decrement Inventory upon each sale, enabling just-in-time replenishment across its fulfillment network. <br/> - Walmart's Retail Link platform syncs POS scanners with suppliers' inventories, allowing instant updates for thousands of stores worldwide. <!--SR:!2026-05-16,157,439!2026-04-05,116,419-->
- periodic inventory
  - periodic inventory / examples ::@:: - A small retailer may rely on manual inventory counts at month-end and record purchases in a single Purchases ledger, calculating COGS only once per period. <!--SR:!2026-05-09,151,439!2026-05-22,163,439-->
- perpetual inventory
  - perpetual inventory / inventory over and short ::@:: Discrepancies between perpetual balances and physical counts result in an "_Inventory Over/Short_" entry that adjusts COGS (in practice, often shown as Other Income/Expense instead). _Debit_ means inventory is lost, and vice versa. <p> This does not apply for periodic inventory. <!--SR:!2026-05-19,160,439!2026-05-11,153,439-->
- inventory
  - inventory / verification ::@:: Periodic checks are mandatory regardless of the accounting system; they confirm that perpetual records match actual stock levels. <p> example: Although Walmart uses perpetual inventory, it conducts rolling store-wide audits using handheld scanners during off-hours, reconciling any shrinkage or theft immediately. <!--SR:!2026-05-09,151,439!2026-05-15,157,439-->
  - inventory / inclusion ::@:: An item is recognized when the company gains control, usually indicated by passage of title or legal ownership. <p> Control may arise from purchase agreements, consignment arrangements, or transfer-with-repurchase agreements. <!--SR:!2026-04-04,115,419!2026-05-20,161,439-->
- [FOB](../../../../general/FOB%20(shipping).md) ::@:: It is a term in international commercial law specifying at what point respective obligations, costs, and risk involved in the delivery of goods shift from the seller to the buyer under the Incoterms standard published by the International Chamber of Commerce. <!--SR:!2026-05-12,154,439!2026-05-11,153,439-->
  - FOB / shipping point ::@:: Title passes at delivery to the carrier; the buyer records inventory and the seller dispenses inventory upon dispatch. <!--SR:!2026-05-09,151,439!2026-05-20,161,439-->
  - FOB / destination ::@:: Title passes only when goods reach the buyer's premises; inventory is recorded at receipt \(for both buyer and seller\). <!--SR:!2026-05-10,152,439!2026-05-17,158,439-->
- [consignment](../../../../general/consignment.md) ::@:: It is a process whereby a person gives permission to another party to take care of their property while retaining full ownership of the property until the item is sold to the final buyer. <!--SR:!2026-05-16,157,439!2026-05-16,157,439-->
  - consignment / examples ::@:: Williams Art Gallery ships art to Sotheby's; Sotheby's holds and sells, then remits proceeds less commission back to Williams. <!--SR:!2026-05-18,159,439!2026-05-16,157,439-->
  - consignment / accounting ::@:: The consignor retains ownership until the consignee sells the item \(no change in balance sheet\); the consignee records no inventory. When the sale happens, the consignee records a liability for sales commissions. <!--SR:!2026-05-15,157,439!2026-05-13,155,439-->
- [repurchase agreement](../../../../general/repurchase%20agreement.md) ::@:: It is a form of secured short-term borrowing, usually, though not always, using government securities as collateral. A contracting party sells a security to a lender and, by agreement between the two parties, repurchases the security back shortly afterwards, at a slightly higher contracted price. <!--SR:!2026-05-19,160,439!2026-05-11,153,439-->
  - repurchase agreement / accounting ::@:: The seller \(who will repurchase\) retains control by agreeing to repurchase the goods at a later date, effectively financing its own inventory. <p> The seller must record both the inventory \(as it retains control\) and a corresponding liability \(similar to borrowing\); failure to do so can hide debt (e.g., Lehman's Repo 105 fraud, Enron's Special Purpose Entities, etc.). <!--SR:!2026-05-10,152,439!2026-03-29,110,419-->
- accounts receivable
  - accounts receivable / returns and allowances
    - accounts receivable / returns and allowances / inventory ::@:: When returns are expected, revenue is recorded net of an estimated _refund/return liability_; cost of goods sold is adjusted for expected returned units using the account "_Estimated Inventory Returns_". <!--SR:!2027-03-24,403,419!2026-04-05,116,419-->
      - accounts receivable / returns and allowances / inventory / examples ::@:: Quality Publishing sells textbooks to campus stores expecting a 25% return; it records $75k sales revenue \(with $25k refund liability\) and a $15k inventory-return estimate against the original $60k cost \(COGS increase by $45k only\). <!--SR:!2026-05-20,161,439!2026-03-29,110,419-->
