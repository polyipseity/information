- topic: environment framework; conceptual framework; financial reporting
- [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) ::@:: It is a branch of accounting concerned with the summary, analysis and reporting of financial transactions related to a business.
  - financial accounting / environment ::@:: Accounting produces financial statements for financial reporting purposes. They are used by stakeholders to allocate capital. High-quality standards are needed to standardize accounting practices and financial statements, so that stakeholders can be well-informed.
  - financial reporting / organizations ::@:: International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\): the independent accounting standard-setting body of the IFRS Foundation <br/> International Organization of Securities Commissions \(IOSCO\): an association of organizations that regulate the world's securities and futures markets
  - financial reporting / conceptual framework ::@:: A conceptual framework is needed for accounting to standardize accounting practices and financial statements. One such framework is International Financial Reporting Standards \(IFRS\). It has been developed \(and continuously developed to handle new environments\) over a long time. We should be aware of its overview, its objectives, e.g. elements of financial statements, qualitative characteristics of accounting information, etc.
  - financial reporting / assumptions and principles ::@:: There are many assumptions and principles in accounting, e.g. cost constraint.
  - financial reporting / challenges ::@:: convergence of standards, ethics, expectation gap, financial reporting issues, politics, etc.
- [International Financial Reporting Standards](../../../../general/International%20Financial%20Reporting%20Standards.md) \(IFRS\) ::@:: They are accounting standards issued by the IFRS Foundation and the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\). They constitute a standardised way of describing the company's financial performance and position so that company financial statements are understandable and comparable across international boundaries. They are particularly relevant for companies with shares or securities publicly listed.
  - International Financial Reporting Standards / convergence ::@:: IFRS have replaced many different national accounting standards around the world but have not replaced the separate accounting standards in the United States where US GAAP is applied. <p> Most jurisdictions requires IFRS for most or all companies. A few jurisdictions permits IFRS \(and allows other formats\). Only a few jurisdictions have their own national standards, some of which are converging to IFRS.
  - International Financial Reporting Standards / motivation ::@:: Economics around the world are increasingly intertwined under _globalization_. Even Donald Trump's recent policies do not stop it \(as seen from Frankel index, trade volume, etc.\) <p> Many national exchanges list a significant foreign companies, making up a significant portion of market capitalization, e.g. Chinese stocks in the United States.
    - International Financial Reporting Standards / motivation / foreign exchanges ::@:: By listing on foreign exchanges, companies can raise more international funds rather than from domestic ones only. Foreign investors have more choices for investments. For example, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. went public \(IPO\) on the New York Stock Exchange \(NYSE\) in 2014. Later, it had a secondary on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange \(HKEX\) on 2019-11.
- [capital market](../../../../general/capital%20market.md) ::@:: It is a financial market in which long-term debt \(over a year\) or equity-backed securities are bought and sold, in contrast to a money market where short-term debt is bought and sold.
  - capital market / financial and information flows ::@:: Capital flows from households and investors to firms via financial regulators, institutions, or intermediaries. Information flows from firms to households and investors via accounting regulators, auditors, or information intermediaries. <p> The financial intermediaries and information intermediaries exchange capital and information with each other.
- financial reporting
  - financial reporting / importance ::@:: Many economics depressions are linked to poor quality accounting information, e.g. the Great Depression \(1929–39\), savings and loans crisis \(1980s–early 90s\), Asian financial crisis \(1997–98\), dot-com bubble \(2000–02\), global financial crisis \(2007–09\), etc.
  - financial reporting / essential characteristics ::@:: _Identify_, _measure_, and _communicate_ financial information of economic entities to interested parties. Users can then _allocate_ capital _efficiently_, ensuring capital markets are efficient.
- ACCT 3010
  - ACCT 3010 / introduction
    - ACCT 3010 / introduction / artificial intelligence
- International Financial Reporting Standards
  - International Financial Reporting Standards / importance ::@:: common corporate governance, common delivery systems \(e.g. XBRL\), common disclosure, common laws and regulations, consistency, education and training, quality information, quality practices, etc.
- [International Accounting Standards Board](../../../../general/International%20Accounting%20Standards%20Board.md) \(IASB\) ::@:: It is the independent accounting standard-setting body of the IFRS Foundation. <p> It was founded on 2001-04-01, as the successor to the International Accounting Standards Committee \(IASC\). It is responsible for developing International Financial Reporting Standards \(IFRS\) and for promoting their use and application.
  - International Accounting Standards Board / due process ::@:: Identify a _topic_ to place on the Board's agenda. Research and analyze to produce pros and cons. Hold _public hearings_. Evaluate to produce a _exposure draft_. Respond to responses to the exposure draft. Issue a _final standard_.
    - International Accounting Standards Board / due process / characteristics ::@:: _collaborative_ efforts <br/> _engagement_ with accountants, business leaders, investors, and regulators <br/> _independent_ standard-setting board <br/> _thorough_ and _systematic_ standard-setting process

  - financial accounting / conceptual framework
- [IFRS 16](../../../../general/IFRS%2016.md) ::@:: It is an International Financial Reporting Standard \(IFRS\) promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\) providing guidance on accounting for leases.
  - IFRS 16 / history ::@:: It was issued in January 2016 and is effective for most companies that report under IFRS since 1 January 2019. Upon becoming effective, it replaced the earlier leasing standard, IAS 17.
  - IFRS 16 / lessees ::@:: It has a substantial impact on the financial statements of lessees of property and equipment – requiring that leases be placed on-balance sheet by recognising a 'right-of-use' asset and a lease liability.
    - IFRS 16 / lessees / pre-IFRS 16 ::@:: Lease payments were treated purely as operating expenses with no balance‑sheet impact.
    - IFRS 16 / lessees / under IFRS 16 ::@:: Lease payments must be placed on-balance sheet by recognizing a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.
  - IFRS 16 / lessors ::@:: It substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases.
  - IFRS 16 / example ::@:: Delta Airlines is one of the world's largest airlines and leases most of its fleet. <p> Prior to IFRS 16 \(IAS 17\) these leases were classified largely as operating leases—the lease payments appeared only on the income statement, with no corresponding asset or liability on the balance sheet. <p> The transition to IFRS 16 \(effective 2019\) required almost all lessees to recognize a right‑of‑use \(ROU\) asset and an associated lease liability for every lease that has a term of more than 12 months, unless it is a short‑term lease or a low‑value asset.
    - IFRS 16 / example / lease terms ::@:: - Duration: 5 years <br/> - Annual lease payment: \$10 million → total cash outflow of \$50 million over the lease life. <br/> - Discount rate \(Delta's incremental borrowing rate\): 5% <p> - Using a 5% discount factor for a 5‑year annuity, the present value \(PV\) of future payments is **\$43.3 million**.
    - IFRS 16 / example / pre-IFRS 16 treatment ::@:: - Each year, $10 million was recorded as an operating lease expense on the income statement. <br/> - No asset or liability appeared on the balance sheet; the aircraft remained a _fixed asset_ \(purchased or financed separately\). <br/> - Cash‑flow impact: Operating cash outflows of $10 million each year.
    - IFRS 16 / example / lease liability treatment ::@:: Use the _effective‑interest_ amortization method. <p> - Recognized at PV = \$43.3 million. <br/> - The liability is reduced over time by the principal portion of lease payments; interest expense is recognized on the remaining balance. <br/> - Year‑1 interest: 5% × \$43.3 million = **\$2.165 million**. <br/> - Principal payment in year 1 = \$10 million – \$2.165 million = **\$7.835 million**, reducing the liability to \$35.465 million for year 2.
    - IFRS 16 / example / right-of-use asset treatment ::@:: - Also recognized at \$43.3 million \(net of any lease incentives or initial direct costs\). <br/> - Amortized \("depreciation" but for intangible assets\) on a straight‑line basis \(other amortization methods may be used\) over the lease term: \$43.3 million ÷ 5 = **\$8.66 million per year**.
    - IFRS 16 / example / income statement impact ::@:: - Depreciation/amortization of ROU asset: \$8.66 million. <br/> - Interest expense on liability: \$2.165 million \(decreasing each subsequent year\). <br/> - Total lease cost in year 1: \$10.825 million, slightly higher than the pre‑IFRS 16 operating expense due to the inclusion of interest.
    - IFRS 16 / example / cash flow statement impact::@:: - Cash outflow remains \$10 million. <br/> - The principal portion \(\$7.835 million\) is reclassified from operating to financing activity; the interest component \(\$2.165 million\) stays in operating activities \(consistent with IAS 8 guidance on lease classification\).
    - IFRS 16 / example / balance sheet impact ::@:: - Increase in total assets by \$43.3 million \(ROU asset\). <br/> - Increase in total liabilities by \$43.3 million \(lease liability\), netting to zero change in equity directly from the lease.
    - IFRS 16 / example / Delta Airlines ::@:: Right‑of‑use assets totaled \$25.9 billion with lease liabilities of \$24.8 billion; annual payments averaged \$4.5 billion over 5–15 year terms at a weighted‑average discount rate of 4.5%.
  - IFRS 16 / implementation steps ::@:: identify → recognize → amortize
    - IFRS 16 / implementation steps / identify ::@:: Identify all leases with terms &gt;12 months.
    - IFRS 16 / implementation steps / recognize ::@:: Compute PV of lease payments using the incremental borrowing rate or lessee's discount rate if it is more reflective of market conditions. Recognize ROU asset and liability at that PV; adjust for any lease incentives, initial direct costs, or residual value guarantees. \(There are several cases for adjustment, which will not be mentioned here.\)
    - IFRS 16 / implementation steps / amortize ::@:: Allocate depreciation/amortization over the lease term \(or shorter useful life if the asset's useful life is shorter\). Record interest expense on the lease liability using the effective‑interest method each reporting period.
- [IFRS 2](../../../../general/IFRS%202.md) ::@:: It is an international financial reporting standard issued in February 2004 by the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\) to provide guidance on the accounting for share based payments. <p> Its purpose is to reflect the cost of awarding equity or equity based incentives to employees or other parties in exchange for goods or services.
  - IFRS 2 / pre-IFRS 2 ::@:: Prior to IFRS 2, ESOs were disclosed but not expensed, masking significant compensation costs.
  - IFRS 2 / example ::@:: Amazon recorded \$19.6 billion in stock‑based compensation expense \(employee stock options \(ESOs\), restricted stock units \(RSUs\)\), valuing each option at a fair value of \$150 \(Black–Scholes model: volatility 30 %, risk‑free rate 3 %, term 5 years\). <p> The requirement to recognize outflows of economic benefits and measure them at fair value ensures that the true cost of ESOs \(e.g. Amazon's net income reduced by 10–15% post-expensing\) is reflected in net income, ensuring relevance for investors and comparability across firms.
- financial accounting
  - financial accounting / conceptual framework
    - financial accounting / conceptual framework / examples ::@:: A \$1,000,000 prize with 10,000 tickets sold; secondary market price per ticket is $90. The donor's purchase of one ticket for \$150 raises questions about appropriate measurement—whether to record at issue price, fair value \(\$90\), or some other basis.
- [IFRS 9](../../../../general/IFRS%209.md) ::@:: It is an International Financial Reporting Standard \(IFRS\) published by the International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\). It addresses the accounting for financial instruments. It contains three main topics: classification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting.
  - IFRS 9 / history ::@:: The standard came into force on 1 January 2018, replacing the earlier IFRS for financial instruments, IAS 39.
  - IFRS 9 / example ::@:: Bank of America holds investment securities and loans, measured at fair value or amortized cost. <p> The framework provides criteria for measurement choice \(relevance vs. reliability\) and helps prevent asset overstatement during boom periods.
    - IFRS 9 / example / pre-IFRS 9 ::@:: During the 2008 crisis, BofA marked down mortgage‑backed securities by \$60 billion \(from a book value of \$300 billion to a fair value of \$240 billion\), generating \$4.3 billion in losses.
    - IFRS 9 / example / post-IFRS 9 ::@:: In 2023, BofA classifies \$400 billion of debt securities at amortized cost \(held to collect cash flows\) and \$100 billion at fair value through profit or loss \(trading portfolio\), with a \$5 billion swing in earnings due to fair‑value changes.
- financial accounting
  - financial accounting / conceptual framework
    - financial accounting / conceptual framework / purpose ::@:: Establishes a coherent set of concepts that underpin all IFRS pronouncements, enabling consistent rule‑making and fostering comparability across entities. \(Also applies to national GAAPs.\)
    - financial accounting / conceptual framework / levels ::@:: 1. why: objective <br/> 2. financial statement elements, qualitative characteristics <br/> 3. how: assumptions, constraints, principles; disclosure, measurement, recognition
  - financial accounting / objective ::@:: Provide useful financial information to investors, lenders, and other creditors through general‑purpose statements. Users are assumed to have reasonable knowledge of business and financial accounting for understanding the information.
  - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics ::@:: For _decision making_: Fundamental qualities, which are more important and should be prioritized, are distinguished from enhancing qualities. <p> Cost constraint is part of the framework: How will costs of providing information be balanced against its benefits?
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / all ::@:: faithful representation, relevance; comparability, timeliness, understandability, verifiability
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / fundamental ::@:: More important. Includes: faithful representation, relevance
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / enhancing ::@:: Less important. Includes: comparability, timeliness, understandability, verifiability
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / relevance ::@:: Information is _useful_ only if it can influence the decisions of users. Includes: confirmatory value, materiality, predictive value <p> Standards are drafted to ensure that disclosures affect how investors, lenders, and regulators evaluate an entity.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / faithful representation ::@:: The numbers and descriptions _mirror_ what really happened or existed. Includes: completeness, error-free, neutrality <p> IFRS mandates that all material items be recorded and presented in a manner that reflects reality, not management's preferences.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / predictive value ::@:: It helps forecast future events.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / confirmatory value ::@:: It confirms or corrects prior expectations.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / materiality ::@:: A omission or misstatement of material information matters if it could change an economic decision.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / completeness ::@:: All necessary information is included.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / neutrality ::@:: No bias toward any stakeholder group.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / error-free ::@:: Free from material mistakes.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / comparability ::@:: Information can be compared over time or across entities because it's measured consistently. <p> The Conceptual Framework urges uniform measurement bases \(e.g., fair value vs. historical cost\) so that entities can be compared.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / verifiability ::@:: Independent observers could reach a consensus that the information is an accurate depiction of reality. <p> Standards provide audit trails; auditors can test data against source documents.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / timeliness ::@:: Information is available to decision makers before it loses its influence. <p> Disclosure schedules, footnote disclosures, and management discussion sections are designed to be timely.
    - financial accounting / qualitative characteristics / understandability ::@:: The information can be comprehended by users who have reasonable knowledge and skill. <p> Disclosure schedules, footnote disclosures, and management discussion sections are designed to be comprehensible.
  - financial accounting / core assumptions ::@:: accrual basis, economic entity, going concern, monetary unit, periodicity
    - financial accounting / core assumptions / economic entity ::@:: A company's activities are separate from those of its owners or other businesses.
    - financial accounting / core assumptions / going concern ::@:: The business will continue operating for the foreseeable future, unless there is evidence to the contrary.
    - financial accounting / core assumptions / monetary unit ::@:: Money is the common denominator for all transactions \(U.S. dollars, euros, etc.\).
    - financial accounting / core assumptions / periodicity ::@:: The company's economic life can be divided into discrete reporting periods (quarterly, annually).
    - financial accounting / core assumptions / accrual basis ::@:: Revenues are recognized when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of cash flow timing.
  - financial accounting / measurement principles ::@:: Historical cost \(faithful representation\) vs. fair value \(market relevance\), with IASB permitting fair‑value measurement for financial assets/liabilities when appropriate.
    - financial accounting / measurement principles / historical cost ::@:: "The amount of money paid or the fair value of consideration given to acquire an asset."
    - financial accounting / measurement principles / fair value ::@:: "The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants."
    - financial accounting / measurement principles / amortized cost ::@:: "The amount of a financial asset or liability that is carried on the balance sheet, adjusted for any initial measurement adjustments, subsequent interest, principal repayments, and impairment." <p> - Applies to assets/liabilities held to collect contractual cash flows \(e.g., bonds\). <br> - Uses the effective‑interest method.
  - financial accounting / full disclosure ::@:: A company must provide all information that is material and would influence the decisions of an informed user. They are required to be presented in _statements_, _notes_, or _supplementary disclosures_.
  - financial accounting / cost constraint ::@:: Companies must weight the benefits of information against the costs of providing them. <p> For example, to justify a particular disclosure or measure, a company must demonstrate that the benefits outweigh its costs; otherwise, it may not be mandated.
  - financial accounting / environments ::@:: IFRS operates within varying political environments, affecting enforcement and adoption. There are many stakeholders: academicians, accounting firms, businesses, financial community, governments, industry associations, investing public, preparers, etc.
  - financial accounting / challenges ::@:: Emerging challenges include non‑financial metrics, forward‑looking disclosures, intangible assets, and maintaining timeliness in rapidly changing markets.

- topic: income statement; earnings management; earnings per share
- [income statement](../../../../general/income%20statement.md) ::@:: It is one of the financial statements of a company and shows the company's revenues and expenses during a particular period. <p> It indicates how the revenues \(also known as the _"top line"_\) are transformed into the net income or net profit \(the result after all revenues and expenses have been accounted for\).
  - income statement / purposes ::@:: - Provides a snapshot of a company's financial performance over a specific period. <br/> - Enables users to evaluate past results, forecast future earnings, and assess the risk associated with future cash‑flow generation.
  - income statement / limitations ::@:: - Items that cannot be measured reliably are often omitted, which can skew the picture of profitability. <br/> - The choice of accounting methods \(e.g., revenue recognition, depreciation\) influences reported income figures. <br/> - Income measurement requires significant judgement; therefore, numbers may not fully reflect underlying economic reality.
- [earnings management](../../../../general/earnings%20management.md) ::@:: It, in accounting, is the act of intentionally influencing the process of financial reporting to obtain some private gain. <p> Companies sometimes time the recognition of revenues, expenses, gains or losses to meet earnings targets or to present a smoother profit trend.
  - earnings management / effects ::@:: When earnings are manipulated in this way, the resulting "quality" of earnings drops because the information becomes less useful for predicting future performance.
- income statement
  - income statement / elements ::@:: income \(revenues, gains\), expenses \(\(_ordinary_\) expenses, losses\)
    - income statement / elements / income ::@:: the net increase in equity resulting from all inflows and enhancements of assets minus liability incurrences, excluding shareholder contributions
    - income statement / elements / revenues ::@:: cash or non‑cash inflows from ordinary business activities \(sales, fees, interest, dividends, rent\)
    - income statement / elements / gains ::@:: increases in economic benefits that arise inside or outside routine operations \(e.g., sale of long‑term assets, unrealised gains on trading securities\)
    - income statement / elements / expenses ::@:: outflows or depletions that reduce economic benefits, again excluding distributions to shareholders <p> may also refer to _ordinary_ expenses only, which arise from ordinary business activities \(cost of goods sold, depreciation, interest, salaries, taxes\)
    - income statement / elements / losses ::@:: reductions in equity from ordinary or non-ordinary activities \(e.g., restructuring charges, disposal losses, unrealised trading‑security losses\)
  - income statement / components ::@:: important items: gross profit → income from operations → income before income tax → income from continuing operations → net income → non-controlling interest → \(basic and diluted\) earnings per share
    - income statement / components / gross profit ::@:: Calculated as Net Sales minus Cost of Goods Sold \(COGS\). The "Net" in Net Sales accounts for discounts, allowances, returns, etc. <p> A key indicator for evaluating operational efficiency and predicting future earnings. Industry benchmarks vary widely: e.g., Apple's gross margin was 46.7% in FY 2024, while Pfizer's exceeded 70%.
    - income statement / components / other income and expense ::@:: They are _operating_ incomes and expenses that do not fit into the revenues and expenses categories above, and usually includes \(different depending on core businesses\): <p> - Write‑downs of inventories or fixed assets, restructuring provisions and their reversals.
    - income statement / components / income from operations ::@:: Derived by subtracting selling expenses, administrative expenses, plus other other income and expense, from Gross Profit. <p> Highlights the earnings that stem directly from core business activities and is often used to forecast cash‑flow timing and uncertainty.
    - income statement / components / non-operating items ::@ They are _non-operating_ incomes and expenses, and usually includes \(different depending on core businesses\): <p> - Disposal gains or losses on property, plant & equipment or investments. <br/> - Rent revenue, dividend revenue, interest revenue, etc. <br/> - Litigation settlements and other liability reversals that materially affect financial results.
    - income statement / components / income before income tax ::@:: Income Before Tax = Income from Operations+ Non‑Operating Items \(gains or losses\) − Interest Expense + Other Non‑Tax Expenses <br/> The latter two can be summarized as Financing Costs.
      - income statement / components / income before income tax / motivation ::@:: By removing the effect of tax policy, jurisdictional differences, and timing of tax settlements, income before tax offers a cleaner view of how well a company's core operations are performing. <p> It allows cross‑company comparisons even when those companies operate in countries with vastly different statutory tax rates or have differing levels of deferred tax assets/liabilities.
    - income statement / components / income from continuing operations ::@:: It refers to the part of a company's business that is expected to keep operating into the future. It excludes any segment or activity that has been sold, shut down, or otherwise declared as discontinued \(e.g., a divested subsidiary or a line of products no longer produced\).
    - income statement / components / discontinued operations ::@:: Losses \(or gains\) from discontinued operations. As it is below the tax items, _tax effects_ of those losses/gains needs to be accounted for. <p> They are reported separately and often in a distinct section below income from continuing operations. The loss or gain on the disposal of the discontinued segment is shown, along with its tax impact.
    - income statement / components / net income ::@:: It is _the bottom line_: revenue minus all expenses, gains, and losses \(including discontinued operations\) for the period. Frequently regarded as the most critical measure of a company's success or failure over a given timeframe.
    - income statement / components / non-controlling interest ::@:: It represents the portion of a subsidiary's equity that is not owned by the parent company. It is also called "minority interest" when referring to shareholders who hold less than 50% of voting rights in a subsidiary. In consolidated financial statements, NCI ensures that all economic interests in the subsidiary are reported, not just those belonging to the parent.
      - income statement / components / non-controlling interest / effect ::@:: _Net income attributable to non‑controlling interest_ is shown as a separate line item below \(or above\) earnings attributable to the parent. This figure equals the subsidiary's net income multiplied by the NCI ownership percentage.
    - income statement / components / earnings per share \(EPS\) ::@:: Calculated by dividing Net Income less _Preferred Dividends_ by the weighted‑average number of _ordinary_ shares outstanding. Must appear prominently on the face of the income statement because it directly relates company performance to shareholder value. <p> Both _basic_ and _diluted_ EPS are reported.
      - income statement / components / earnings per share / basic ::@:: It is the portion of a company's profit that is attributable to each share of common stock outstanding.
      - income statement / components / earnings per share / diluted ::@:: It is a company's earnings per share calculated using fully diluted shares outstanding \(i.e. including the impact of stock option grants and convertible bonds\).
- [earnings per share](../../../../general/earnings%20per%20share.md) \(EPS\) ::@:: It is the monetary value of earnings per outstanding share of common stock for a company during a defined period of time, often a year. It is a key measure of corporate profitability, focusing on the interests of the company's owners \(shareholders\), and is commonly used to price stocks.
  - earnings per share / formula ::@:: earnings per share = ⁠\(net income − preferred dividends\) / weighted average common shares

  - IFRS 5 / discontinued operations ::@:: It is a component of an enterprise that has either been disposed of, or is classified as 'held for sale', and: <p> - represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; and <br/> - is part of a single, co-ordinated plan to dispose of this separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or <br/> - is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. <p> These criteria ensure that only significant, standalone divestitures are treated as discontinued operations.
    - IFRS 5 / discontinued operations / examples ::@: selling divisions, lines of business, subsidiaries to other companies; spinning off independent companies
  - IFRS 5 / reporting requirements ::@:: _Separate income‑statement line items_ as a _separate category_ after "income from continuing operations" must disclose: <p> - Gain or loss from disposal. <br/> - Operating results of the disposed component \(as if it were still part of the company\). <br/> - Net of tax, as it is below the tax items. <br/> - Per‑share amounts \(EPS\) for continuing operations, discontinued operations, and both must be presented either on the face of the statement or in accompanying notes.
    - IFRS 5 / reporting requirements / motivation ::@:: The presentation is designed to keep the impact of major divestitures transparent and distinct from ongoing business performance.
    - IFRS 5 / reporting requirements / example ::@:: A diversified firm, decided to discontinue its electronics division during the year. <p> - Operating loss for the division \(net of tax\): £300&nbsp;000. <br/> - Loss on sale of the division at year‑end: £500&nbsp;000 \(net of tax\). <p> These figures would be shown in the discontinued‑operations section, allowing stakeholders to see the full effect of the divestiture separate from core operations.
- [minority interest](../../../../general/minority%20interest.md) ::@:: It is the portion of a subsidiary corporation's stock that is not owned by the parent corporation. The magnitude of the minority interest in the subsidiary company is generally less than 50% of outstanding shares, or the corporation would generally cease to be a subsidiary of the parent.
  - minority interest / consolidated financial statements ::@:: In consolidated financial statements, if the parent owns more than 50% of a subsidiary, it consolidates 100% of the subsidiary's revenues, assets, and liabilities.
  - minority interest / income statement ::@:: The portion of profits or losses attributable to minority shareholders is reported separately as _non‑controlling interest_ \(NCI\) on the equity section. <p> Generally, net income, those attributable to majority interest, and those attribute to minority interest, are reported separately. For EPS, only those attributable to majority interest is used and reported.
- [comprehensive income](../../../../general/comprehensive%20income.md) ::@:: It is "the change in equity \[net assets\] of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners."
  - comprehensive income / components ::@:: It encompasses: <p> - All revenues, gains, expenses, and losses that appear in net income. <br/> - Other comprehensive income \(OCI\): Additional items that bypass net income but still affect equity \(e.g., unrealized gains/losses on certain securities, foreign‑currency translation adjustments, pension and post‑retirement benefit adjustments, cash‑flow hedge gains/losses\).
  - comprehensive income / other comprehensive income ::@:: Additional items that bypass net income but still affect equity \(e.g., unrealized gains/losses on certain securities, foreign‑currency translation adjustments, pension and post‑retirement benefit adjustments, cash‑flow hedge gains/losses\). <p> Also see _accumulated other comprehensive income_.
  - comprehensive income / presentation ::@:: The section is typically presented as a single line in the statement of changes in equity or within a separate comprehensive income statement.
    - comprehensive income / presentation / comprehensive income statement ::@:: It start with the net income. And then two sections called "items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss" and "items that will not be reclassified to profit and loss". Finally, sum appropriately to get the "other comprehensive income" and "total comprehensive income". <p> If there is NCI, total comprehensive income, those attributable to majority interest, and those attribute to minority interest are reported separately.
- [accumulated other comprehensive income](../../../../general/accumulated%20other%20comprehensive%20income.md) \(AOCI\) ::@:: Since other comprehensive income \(OCI\) are not closed to retained earnings each period they accumulate as shareholder equity items and thus are entitled "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" and is sometimes referred to as "AOCI".
  - accumulated other comprehensive income / rationale ::@:: They are excluded from net income because they are either unrealized \(e.g., market‑value adjustments\), non‑operational, or volatile \(which harms comparability\). <p> They are subject to market fluctuations that have not yet been realized through a transaction \(e.g., AFS securities, currency translation\), or caused by events unrelated to core business operations \(e.g., actuarial adjustments to pension plans, financial volatility\).
  - accumulated other comprehensive income / components ::@:: _common_ components in decreasing _typical_ weights: unrealized gains/losses on available‑for‑sale securities &gt; foreign-currency translation adjustments &gt; pension/post-retirement benefit adjustments &gt; cash-flow hedge gains/losses
  - accumulated other comprehensive income / examples ::@:: - Alphabet Inc. reported \$1.2 billion in unrealized gains on AFS securities in 2024, reflecting appreciation of Google Cloud–related investments. <br/> - ExxonMobil's \$150 million hedge gain remained unrealized until fuel contract settlements. <br/>  - BP's \$1.8 billion currency‑translation gain stemmed from USD/GBP exchange rate changes rather than operational performance. <br/> - GM's \$300 million pension loss in 2024 was a one‑time actuarial adjustment due to rising interest rates.
  - accumulated other comprehensive income / presentation ::@:: It is a subsection in the equity section of the balance sheet where "other comprehensive income" is accumulated \(summed or "aggregated"\).
