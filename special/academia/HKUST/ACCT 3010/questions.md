## week 3 lecture 2

> Coca‑Cola Company \(KO\) earns its revenue by selling beverage concentrates to bottling partners around the world, such as Coca‑Cola FEMSA in Mexico and Coca‑Cola Europacific Partners covering Europe and Asia. Because these bottlers operate in a variety of currencies, KO is exposed to foreign‑exchange risk. In addition, KO holds equity interests in some bottlers—about 19% in FEMSA—which are accounted for as either equity‑method investments or available‑for‑sale \(AFS\) securities, giving rise to unrealized gains and losses. What OCI items that could appear on Coca‑Cola's financial statements arise from these currency exposures and the valuation changes of those equity holdings?
>
> 1. cash flow hedge gains/losses
> 2. unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale \(AFS\) securities
> 3. pension and post-retirement benefit adjustments
> 4. foreign currency translation adjustments

## week 4 lecture

> Do you think the U.S. Government will be solvent in 10 years?
>
> The national debt of the U.S. Government is increasing relative to the national GDP. It is projected to exceed any previously recorded level in 2029 and continuing to rise significantly until at least 2055.
>
> ---
>
> - solution: {@{\(for reference only\) The U.S. is likely to remain solvent over the next decade, but its fiscal position will become increasingly precarious. Current spending patterns and entitlement obligations suggest that without substantial policy shifts—either in revenue growth or expenditure restraint—the debt trajectory could outpace economic growth, tightening the budgetary space for future priorities. This scenario underscores the need for structural reforms \(tax, spending, or both\) if the U.S. wants to avoid compromising its long‑term economic resilience.}@}

## week 4 lecture 2

> Could you produce a Statement of Cash Flows \(SCF\) for Tesla that matches its official version by applying the indirect method?
>
> ---
>
> - solution: {@{Yes. Tesla uses the indirect method to produce its SCF. The key is using identical data sources; any discrepancy usually comes from different interpretations of adjustments.}@}
