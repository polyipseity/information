# Python error

## types

There are two types of errors: {{syntax errors and runtime errors}}. The former {{occurs during compilation and is detected by the compiler, while the latter occurs during execution}}.

## runtime errors

Runtime errors occur when {{something error or unexpected}} happens. The program {{generally crashes}} when an error occurs. There are {{many types of errors, such as `IndexError`, `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, etc.}}

## catching errors

Sometimes, we can {{handle some errors using `try...except...else`}}. It consists of {{a statement block, and one or more error types (optional), error names (optional), error handler statement blocks, and a no-error statement block (optional)}}:

```Python
try:
  statement_block
except ErrorTypes as errorNames: # `ErrorTypes` optional, `as errorNames` optional
  statement_block
else: # optional
  statement_block # optional
```

Multiple {{`except`s are allowed}}. Additionally, to use the same error handler statement block to handle multiple error types, one can {{use `,` to concatenate multiple error types and enclose them in parentheses `()` in `except`, like `except (errorType1, errorType2, errorType3) as exc:`}}.

The semantics of the `try...except...else` statement is that {{the statement block directly after the `try` are executed. If there are no errors, the `else` statement block if any are executed and the `try...except...else` statement finishes}}. When an error is thrown in `try` statement block, {{the execution of `try` statement block stops. The error types in `except` are checked in appearance order. The first `except` with an error type that is the same class as or a base class of the thrown error type is selected. The statement block directly after the selected `except` are executed and the `try...except...else` statement finishes}}. If no `except` clauses match, {{the error continues to propagate upwards. If the error reaches further upward from the entry point, the program usually crashes}}.

Examples where catching errors is useful include {{parsing user inputs}}.
