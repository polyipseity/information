- HKUST ELEC 1100
- name: Introduction to Electro-Robot Design
- credits: 4

---

ELEC1100 is designed to provide the fundamental knowledge in electrical engineering, basic electronic components and skills needed for the design, implementation and evaluation of a robot and its subsystems. It covers the basic electronic engineering principles and techniques. Hands-on laboratory sessions, complemented with lectures and tutorials, are provided to allow students to have a systematic view of the electronic engineering principles. Students apply the knowledge and principles learnt to design and build a functional robot by themselves.

- For any grading components, late submission will NOT be accepted.
- Make-up sessions and special accommodations are handled by the
  instructor or IA; consult the official syllabus or LMS for contact
  details rather than embedding names or email addresses in the note.
  Submit proof of absence within one week to arrange a make-up session.
  Medical accommodations require a hard copy of the original
  certificate.

The content is in teaching order.

<!-- The source timetable contained a duplicated week‑9 row: the first instance covers **30 Mar 2026 – 03 Apr 2026** (lab exam, tutorial, lecture plus the public holiday on 3 Apr).  A second copy of week‑9 appeared for **06 Apr 2026 – 10 Apr 2026** (three consecutive public holidays followed by the final project lecture).  We treat the latter region as *week 10* and renumber all subsequent weeks accordingly.  Holiday days are represented as public‑holiday sessions with status `public holiday` so they remain visible without inflating the lecture count. -->
