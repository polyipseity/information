- see: [general/electronic component](../../../../general/electronic%20component.md)

Electronic components are the building blocks used in electronic circuits. They influence the behaviour of currents and voltages and include passive elements such as resistors and capacitors as well as active semiconductor devices such as diodes and transistors. In the context of ELEC 1100 the term also covers the basic electrical concepts needed to understand how these components operate.

## electrical fundamentals

Electricity results from electric charge. When charges accumulate at rest the phenomenon is called _static electricity_; laboratory demonstrations with balloons and combs are common (e.g. rubbing a balloon on hair transfers electrons onto the balloon, leaving hair positively charged and causing attraction/repulsion). Opposite charges attract and like charges repel. When charges move in an organised way we speak of _current electricity_, which is the focus of this course.

### atoms and charge

Atoms consist of positively charged protons, neutral neutrons and negatively charged electrons. A neutral atom has equal numbers of protons and electrons; losing electrons makes the atom positive while gaining them makes it negative. Electrons in the outermost (farthest) orbit are held most weakly and can be added or removed easily, which is why they participate in conduction. The elementary charge carried by one proton (or the magnitude carried by one electron) is approximately 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.

- outer electrons conduction ::@:: Electrons in the outermost orbit are held most weakly and can be added or removed easily, which is why they participate in conduction. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-02-28,4,270-->
- atom structure ::@:: An atom consists of protons (positive), neutrons (neutral), and electrons (negative); it is electrically neutral when protons equal electrons. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-02-28,4,270-->
- elementary charge ::@:: The smallest amount of electric charge is the charge of one proton or electron, q = 1.6×10⁻¹⁹ C. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-02-28,4,270-->
- charge imbalance ::@:: When atoms lose electrons they become positively charged; when they gain electrons they become negatively charged. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-02-28,4,270-->

### conductors and insulators

Materials are classified by how easily charges can move through them. Metals are _conductors_ because their outer electrons are loosely bound and can move freely; materials such as glass or plastic are _insulators_ and restrict charge motion due to tightly bound electrons.

---

Flashcards for this section are as follows:

- material classification ::@:: Materials are classified by how easily charges can move through them, with conductors allowing easy flow and insulators restricting movement. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-02-28,4,270-->
- conductor definition ::@:: A conductor is a material through which charge flows readily because its atoms require little energy to remove outer electrons. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-02-28,4,270-->
- insulator definition ::@:: An insulator is a material that does not allow charge to move easily due to tightly bound electrons. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-02-28,4,270-->

### current

By convention, current direction is defined as the direction positive charges would move; this is opposite to the actual electron flow in metals. Current quantifies the rate at which charge flows past a point in a circuit. By definition $$I = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$$ where ∆q is the charge transported in time ∆t; the unit is the ampere (A), equivalent to one coulomb per second. In metallic conductors the moving charges are electrons, but by convention the direction of current is taken as that of positive charges, opposite to electron flow.

Flashcards for this section are as follows:

- current definition ::@:: Current is the orderly movement of charged particles; I = Δq/Δt, measured in amperes (1 A = 1 C/s). <!--SR:!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-02-28,4,270-->
- current unit ::@:: The unit of current is the ampere, defined as one coulomb of charge passing a point per second. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-02-28,4,270-->

### voltage and potential difference

Voltage (electric potential difference) is the energy per unit charge that drives current. It is measured in volts and is always defined between two points; a reference point called _ground_ (GND) is conventionally assigned 0 V. A battery, for example, maintains a fixed voltage difference between its terminals that forces current through a connected load.

Flashcards for this section are as follows:

- voltage definition ::@:: Voltage is the force that makes electrons move through a conductor; symbol V, unit volt (V). <!--SR:!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-02-28,4,270-->
- potential difference ::@:: Voltage is a difference in electric potential between two points; current flows only if there is a potential difference. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-02-28,4,270-->
- ground reference ::@:: Ground (GND) is a circuit reference point defined to be 0 V; voltage measurements are always relative to another point. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-02-28,4,270-->

## resistance and resistors

Resistance describes how strongly a material opposes the flow of current. For a uniform conductor its resistance is given by $$R = \rho\frac{L}{A}$$ where ρ is the material’s resistivity, L its length and A its cross-sectional area. Components called resistors have a specified resistance and are used to control currents and create voltage drops. Ohm’s law relates voltage, current and resistance: $$V = IR.$$ The unit of resistance is the ohm (Ω), and the symbol R is commonly used in formulas. Resistance can be added to avoid large currents; all loads (light bulbs, motors) and even wires have resistance. Digital multimeters may be used to measure resistance, voltage, or current in lab. Prefixes such as kilo (k = 10³) and milli (m = 10⁻³) are applied to ohms and amperes (e.g. 10 kΩ = 10000 Ω; 50 mA = 0.05 A).

## capacitors

A capacitor consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material. When a voltage is applied, opposite charges accumulate on the plates, storing electrical energy. If the voltage source is removed the capacitor can discharge and supply current for a short period, temporarily powering a circuit. A common analogy is a water tank storing fluid under pressure.

### capacitor actions

Simple circuits illustrate how a capacitor changes transient behaviour. Without any capacitor the lamp only lights while the switch is closed; opening the switch immediately extinguishes the lamp because the supply and load are disconnected. Inserting a capacitor in parallel with the lamp gives the circuit a charge reservoir. When the switch is opened the capacitor discharges through the lamp, allowing it to stay lit for a short time even though the source is removed. The sequence can be summarised as follows:

- switch off, lamp off – capacitor initially uncharged and electrically neutral.
- switch on, lamp on – current flows from the source and the capacitor charges, plates accumulating +/− charge.
- switch opened again, lamp keeps on for a while – capacitor discharges through the lamp and gradually returns to neutral.
