# questions

- HKUST FINA 3203

## derivative definition

1. Is a stock a derivative? ::@:: No by most people's account. <p> But philosophically, you could argue it is a derivative of itself... Whatever that means.
2. Is a combination of stocks \(e.g. mutual fund\) a derivative? ::@:: No by most people's account. You could argue if a stock is not a derivative, then why should a combination of stocks should be? <p> But you could also argue it in the opposite way: It is a derivative of the individual stocks in the combination.
3. Is a closed-end mutual fund a derivative? ::@:: No by most people's account. You could argue it the same way as above. <p> But you could also argue it in the opposite way: Compared to a mutual fund \(combination of stocks\), "closed-end" \(closed to new capital\) makes its value further removed from the underlying stocks, so it is a derivative.
4. Must the item underlying a derivative be delivered at maturity of the derivative? ::@:: No. For example, an event derivative cannot "deliver" an event, whatever that means...

## forward contracts

1. People sometimes commit theft, even taking securities such as shares or bonds. Could the same individuals also pilfer \(steal\) forward contracts? Provide an explanation. \(Assume no legal problems apart from potentially getting jailed.\) ::@:: Yes, if the value of the forward contract is positive.
2. Suppose a risk‑free asset trades at 100 today and the prevailing interest rate is positive. If you commit to sell that same asset one year later for 50, what amount would you consider an equitable present payment so that, on average, you neither profit nor suffer a loss? ::@::
3. What does it mean to sell short? What does it mean to sell long?
    - What does it mean to sell short? ::@:: Sell short means selling a security that you do not currently own, with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price; your profit comes from a decline in its market value.
    - What does it mean to sell long? ::@:: Sell long \(or simply buy\) means purchasing a security and holding it, expecting its price to rise so you can sell later for a higher amount.
4. Given an S&P&nbsp;500 spot level of 1100, a continuously compounded risk‑free rate of 5%, and no dividend yield, consider the following scenarios: <p> - If the quoted price for a six‑month forward is 1135, what action would you take? <br/> - If the quoted price for a six‑month forward is 1115, how would you respond? ::@:: Theoretical forward price is $$1100 \cdot e^{0.05 \times \frac 6 {12} }\approx 1127.9 \,.$$ <p> If the market quote is higher \(e.g. 1135\), you would _short_ the forward. To do so, _long_ the stock \(buy the stock\) and _short_ a bond \(borrow money\). Reverse these trades at maturity. <p> If the quote lies below the fair price \(e.g. 1115\), so you would _go long_ the forward. To do so, _short_ the stock \(borrow the stock\) and _long_ a bond \(lend money\). Reverse these trades at maturity.
    - Given an S&P&nbsp;500 spot level of 1100, a continuously compounded risk‑free rate of 5%, and no dividend yield, consider the following scenarios. What action would you take? / intuition ::@:: Thinking in terms of _positions_ and _payoffs_ help to figure out the correct actions. <p> We take _opposite_ positions on the forward and the stock, which removes the \(uncertain\) future spot price $S_T$ from the future payoff. The current payoff is nonzero. <p> Then, we take _opposite_ positions on the stock and the bond, which resets the current payoff to zero, and generates a risk-free positive future payoff.
