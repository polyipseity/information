## derivative definition

1. Is a stock a derivative? ::@:: No by most people's account. <p> But philosophically, you could argue it is a derivative of itself... Whatever that means. <!--SR:!2025-10-09,16,290!2025-10-07,14,290-->
2. Is a combination of stocks \(e.g. mutual fund\) a derivative? ::@:: No by most people's account. You could argue if a stock is not a derivative, then why should a combination of stocks should be? <p> But you could also argue it in the opposite way: It is a derivative of the individual stocks in the combination. <!--SR:!2025-10-09,16,290!2025-10-07,14,290-->
3. Is a closed-end mutual fund a derivative? ::@:: No by most people's account. You could argue it the same way as above. <p> But you could also argue it in the opposite way: Compared to a mutual fund \(combination of stocks\), "closed-end" makes its value further removed from the underlying stocks, so it is a derivative. <!--SR:!2025-10-08,15,290!2025-10-05,12,270-->
4. Must the item underlying a derivative be delivered at maturity of the derivative? ::@:: No. For example, an event derivative cannot "deliver" an event, whatever that means... <!--SR:!2025-10-08,15,290!2025-10-09,16,290-->
