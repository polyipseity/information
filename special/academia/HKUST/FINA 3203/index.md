- [derivative](../../../../general/derivative%20(finance).md) ::@:: It is a contract between a buyer and a seller. The derivative can take various forms, depending on the transaction, but every derivative has the following four elements: ... <!--SR:!2025-09-26,16,290!2025-09-26,16,290-->
  - derivative / elements ::@:: tradeable item, future act, future act price, future act time <!--SR:!2025-09-26,16,290!2025-09-26,16,290-->
    - derivative / elements / tradeable item ::@:: an item \(the "underlier"\) that can or must be bought or sold, e.g. commodity, event, financial asset, intangible good, natural condition index, etc. <!--SR:!2025-09-24,14,290!2025-09-25,15,290-->
    - derivative / elements / future act ::@:: a future act which must occur \(such as a sale or purchase of the underlier\) <!--SR:!2025-09-24,14,290!2025-09-24,14,290-->
    - derivative / elements / future act price ::@:: a price at which the future transaction must take place <!--SR:!2025-09-24,14,290!2025-09-26,16,290-->
    - derivative / elements / future act time ::@:: a future date by which the act \(such as a purchase or sale\) must take place <!--SR:!2025-09-24,14,290!2025-09-24,14,290-->
  - derivative / examples ::@:: exotic option, forward/future, option, etc. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,15,290!2025-09-24,14,290-->
- [economics](../../../../general/economics.md) ::@:: It is a behavioral science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. <!--SR:!2025-09-24,14,290!2025-09-25,15,290-->
  - economics / objectives ::@:: Maximize _utility_, subject to _constraints_. Constraints are important because people have _limited_ resources. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,15,290!2025-09-25,15,290-->
  - economics / finance ::@:: a subfield of economics <p> _utility_: _expected_ return <br/> _constraint_: _affordable_ risk <!--SR:!2025-09-24,14,290!2025-09-25,15,290-->
    - economics / finance / risk ::@:: It is important because we assume people are _risk-averse_. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,15,290!2025-09-26,16,290-->
- derivative
  - derivative / usage ::@:: There are many usage. A major one is to hedge or to mitigate risk in the underlying, by entering into a derivative contract whose value moves in the opposite direction to their underlying position and cancels part or all of it out. <p> You may prefer some types of risk while disliking other types of risk. Derivatives are _convenient_, _flexible_, and _low cost_ enough to hedge those unwanted risks. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,15,290!2025-09-21,11,270-->
  - derivative / examples
    - derivative / examples / currency future ::@:: I want to use today's exchange rate for a conversion in the future. If you think the target currency will rise in value \(the current currency will depreciate\), then you take a _long position_ in a the target currency's future. Otherwise, you take a _short position_. <p> The _exchange rate risk_ is eliminated, including the case in which the target currency moves in the opposite direction as you expected. One major risk is _counterparty risk_, in which the counterparty does not perform the future act. <!--SR:!2025-09-26,16,290!2025-10-18,28,270-->
    - derivative / examples / put option ::@:: I want to lock-in the capital gains now but realize them in the future \(e.g. for _tax purposes_\), buy an _at-the-money_ put option to sell the shares at the current price in the future, in case the price falls. <p> One major risk is _loss of the premium_ paid to buy the option. Some specific _risks_ for tax purposes is _risk of fluctuating tax rates_. <!--SR:!2025-10-18,28,270!2025-09-21,11,270-->
    - derivative / examples / variance swap ::@:: You are a portfolio manager evaluated based on _tracking errors_ on an index. _Market volatility_ is an obstacle to reducing the tracking error. Entering a _variance swap_ on the index pays off when market volatility rises. <!--SR:!2025-09-22,12,270!2025-09-24,14,290-->
    - derivative / examples / "the big short" ::@:: In 2006: An investor \(John Paulson\) cannot short houses, and housing stocks may be costly to short. But the investor can short APX subprime _index_, short _collateralized debt obligations_ \(CDOs\), buy _credit default swaps_, etc. <p> Derivatives allow the investor to _circumvent_ market restrictions and _speculate_. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,15,290!2025-09-25,15,290-->
    - derivative / examples / call option ::@:: A CEO is compensated with firm shares that cannot be easily sold to motivate the CEO. But this may make the CEO not take profitable but _risky_ projects. Adding _call options_ to the firm shares allow the CEO to _earn more_ if a risky project succeeds, and _lose less_ if it fails. <!--SR:!2025-09-26,16,290!2025-09-25,15,290-->
  - derivative / returns relation ::@:: Investing in a stock \(_long position_\) is assumed to have _linear_ returns. Shorting a stock \(_short position_\) is assumed to also have linear returns but in the _opposite direction_ \(negate the slope\). <p> Derivatives generally have _nonlinear_ returns. This may allow better matching to _risk aversion_, which makes the utility nonlinear. <!--SR:!2025-09-24,14,290!2025-09-26,16,290-->
  - derivative / history ::@:: Even in ancient times \(e.g. BC\), people already have this concept... <!--SR:!2025-09-26,16,290!2025-09-25,15,290-->
  - derivative / popularity ::@:: Most sectors use derivatives, forex \(foreign exchange\), and interest rate. Only some sectors use commodity, credit, and equity. <!--SR:!2025-09-26,16,290!2025-09-26,16,290-->
