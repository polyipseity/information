  - FINA 3203 / logistics
- [derivative](../../../../general/derivative%20(finance).md) ::@:: It is a contract between a buyer and a seller. The derivative can take various forms, depending on the transaction, but every derivative has the following four elements: ... <!--SR:!2025-12-01,66,310!2025-11-30,65,310-->
  - derivative / elements ::@:: tradeable item, future act, future act price, future act time <!--SR:!2025-11-30,65,310!2025-11-28,63,310-->
    - derivative / elements / tradeable item ::@:: an item \(the "underlier"\) that can or must be bought or sold, e.g. commodity, event, financial asset, intangible good, natural condition index, etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,54,310!2025-11-27,63,310-->
    - derivative / elements / future act ::@:: a future act which must occur \(such as a sale or purchase of the underlier\) <!--SR:!2025-11-21,58,310!2025-11-21,58,310-->
    - derivative / elements / future act price ::@:: a price at which the future transaction must take place <!--SR:!2025-11-20,57,310!2025-11-29,64,310-->
    - derivative / elements / future act time ::@:: a future date by which the act \(such as a purchase or sale\) must take place <!--SR:!2025-11-18,55,310!2025-11-19,56,310-->
  - derivative / examples ::@:: exotic option, forward/future, option, etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-26,62,310!2025-11-18,55,310-->
- [economics](../../../../general/economics.md) ::@:: It is a behavioral science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. <!--SR:!2025-11-19,56,310!2025-11-22,58,310-->
  - economics / objectives ::@:: Maximize _utility_, subject to _constraints_. Constraints are important because people have _limited_ resources. <!--SR:!2025-11-24,60,310!2025-11-27,63,310-->
  - economics / finance ::@:: a subfield of economics <p> _utility_: _expected_ return <br/> _constraint_: _affordable_ risk <!--SR:!2025-11-20,57,310!2025-11-22,58,310-->
    - economics / finance / risk ::@:: It is important because we assume people are _risk-averse_. <!--SR:!2025-11-25,61,310!2025-11-29,64,310-->
- derivative
  - derivative / usage ::@:: There are many usage. A major one is to hedge or to mitigate risk in the underlying, by entering into a derivative contract whose value moves in the opposite direction to their underlying position and cancels part or all of it out. <p> You may prefer some types of risk while disliking other types of risk. Derivatives are _convenient_, _flexible_, and _low cost_ enough to hedge those unwanted risks. <!--SR:!2025-11-24,60,310!2025-11-03,43,290-->
  - derivative / examples
    - derivative / examples / currency future ::@:: I want to use today's exchange rate for a conversion in the future. If you think the target currency will rise in value \(the current currency will depreciate\), then you take a _long position_ in a the target currency's future. Otherwise, you take a _short position_. <p> The _exchange rate risk_ is eliminated, including the case in which the target currency moves in the opposite direction as you expected \(you would have earned more if you had not started a future\). One major risk is _counterparty risk_, in which the counterparty does not perform the future act. <!--SR:!2025-11-12,47,290!2026-01-05,79,270-->
    - derivative / examples / put option ::@:: I want to lock-in the capital gains now but realize them in the future \(e.g. for _tax purposes_\), buy an _at-the-money_ put option to sell the shares at the current price in the future, in case the price falls. <p> One major risk is _loss of the premium_ paid to buy the option. Some specific _risks_ for tax purposes is _risk of fluctuating tax rates_. <!--SR:!2026-02-03,108,290!2025-11-01,41,290-->
    - derivative / examples / variance swap ::@:: You are a portfolio manager evaluated based on _tracking errors_ on an index. _Market volatility_ is an obstacle to reducing the tracking error. Entering a _variance swap_ on the index pays off when market volatility rises. <!--SR:!2026-02-25,124,290!2025-11-19,56,310-->
    - derivative / examples / "the big short" ::@:: In 2006: An investor \(John Paulson\) cannot short houses, and housing stocks may be costly to short. But the investor can short APX subprime _index_, short _collateralized debt obligations_ \(CDOs\), buy _credit default swaps_, etc. <p> Derivatives allow the investor to _circumvent_ market restrictions and _speculate_. <!--SR:!2025-11-10,46,290!2025-11-23,59,310-->
    - derivative / examples / call option ::@:: A CEO is compensated with firm shares that cannot be easily sold to motivate the CEO. But this may make the CEO not take profitable but _risky_ projects. Adding _call options_ to the firm shares allow the CEO to _earn more_ if a risky project succeeds, and _lose less_ if it fails. <!--SR:!2025-11-28,63,310!2025-11-23,59,310-->
  - derivative / returns relation ::@:: Investing in a stock \(_long position_\) is assumed to have _linear_ returns. Shorting a stock \(_short position_\) is assumed to also have linear returns but in the _opposite direction_ \(negate the slope\). <p> Derivatives generally have _nonlinear_ returns. This may allow better matching to _risk aversion_, which models the utility function as nonlinear. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,54,310!2025-11-13,48,290-->
  - derivative / history ::@:: Even in ancient times \(e.g. BC\), people already have this concept... <!--SR:!2025-12-02,67,310!2025-11-25,61,310-->
  - derivative / popularity ::@:: Most sectors use derivatives, forex \(foreign exchange\), and interest rate. Only some sectors use commodity, credit, and equity. <!--SR:!2025-12-01,66,310!2025-12-02,67,310-->

- topic: introduction to derivatives; forward contract
- [exchange-traded derivative contract](../../../../general/exchange-traded%20derivative%20contract.md) \(ETDC\) ::@:: They are standardized derivative contracts such as futures and options contracts that are transacted on an organized futures exchange. <!--SR:!2025-11-23,49,324!2025-12-29,79,344-->
  - exchange-traded derivative contract / standardization ::@:: They are standardized and require payment of an initial deposit or margin settled through a clearing house. Since the contracts are standardized, accurate pricing models are often available. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-11-24,50,324-->
  - exchange-traded derivative contract / advantages ::@:: liquid, minimal counterparty risk, standardized, transparent <!--SR:!2026-01-01,82,344!2025-12-24,75,344-->
  - exchange-traded derivative contract / examples ::@:: futures, options \(on futures and stocks\) <!--SR:!2026-01-01,82,344!2025-12-26,77,344-->
- [clearing house](../../../../general/clearing%20house%20(finance).md) ::@:: It is a financial institution formed to facilitate the exchange \(i.e., _clearance_\) of payments, securities, or derivatives transactions. The clearing house stands between two clearing firms \(also known as member firms or participants\). <!--SR:!2025-12-24,75,344!2025-12-24,75,344-->
- [over-the-counter](../../../../general/over-the-counter%20(finance).md) \(OTC\) ::@:: It is done directly between two parties, without the supervision of an exchange. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via exchanges. <p> In an OTC trade, the price is not necessarily publicly disclosed. <!--SR:!2025-12-26,77,344!2025-12-26,77,344-->
  - over-the-counter / characteristics ::@:: customized contracts, exotic contracts, mediated by dealers, not a place <!--SR:!2025-11-30,55,324!2025-12-22,73,344-->
  - over-the-counter / disadvantages ::@:: counterparty risk, less liquid, opaque, systemic risk \(if major dealers are distressed\) <!--SR:!2026-01-02,83,344!2025-12-28,78,344-->
  - over-the-counter / examples ::@:: exotic options, forwards, structured products, swaps <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-12-27,78,344-->
- exchange-traded derivative contract
  - exchange-traded derivative contract / popularity ::@:: Much less popular than over-the-counter derivatives. Their notational value has rarely exceeded the world GDP \(about \$100 trillion\). <!--SR:!2025-12-27,78,344!2025-12-01,56,324-->
- over-the-counter
  - over-the-counter / derivative popularity :: Much more popular than exchange-traded derivatives. Their notational value is several times the world GDP \(about \$100 trillion\).
- derivative
  - derivative / makeup ::@:: \(most popular\) interest rate \(almost 80%\) &gt; foreign exchange \(almost 20%\) &gt; equity &gt; credit &gt; commodities \(least popular\) <!--SR:!2025-11-16,41,304!2025-11-15,40,304-->
  - derivative / popularity ::@:: It has become very popular since the Cobe Global Markets opened in 1973, especially after 2000 and even more so after 2020. <!--SR:!2025-12-31,81,344!2025-12-24,75,344-->
  - derivative / brief history ::@:: We started with somewhat normal derivatives, e.g. equity options, forex futures, swaps, etec.; and they have gotten more weird over time, e.g. catastrophe options, credit derivatives, energy derivatives, exotic options, weather derivatives, etc. <p> Maybe in the future we will get derivatives on climate, liquidity, political risk, or even other derivatives... <!--SR:!2025-12-25,76,344!2025-12-24,75,344-->
  - derivative / risks ::@:: counterparty risk, hidden tail risk, leverage, etc. <!--SR:!2025-12-29,79,344!2025-12-22,73,344-->
    - derivative / risks / disasters ::@:: It has led to many disasters, causing loss in the millions or billions \(in USD dollars\). <p> Warren Buffett referred to derivatives \(specifically, credit default swaps \(CDS\)\) in his famous 2002 speech in which he warned against "financial weapons of mass destruction". <!--SR:!2025-12-27,77,344!2025-12-30,80,344-->
- [financial engineering](../../../../general/financial%20engineering.md) ::@:: It is a multidisciplinary field involving financial theory, methods of engineering, tools of mathematics and the practice of programming. It has also been defined as the application of technical methods, especially from mathematical finance and computational finance, in the practice of finance. <!--SR:!2025-12-02,57,324!2025-12-22,73,344-->
  - financial engineering / criticisms ::@:: It can lead to disasters, e.g. 1978 stock market crash \(portfolio insurance\), 2007–09 global financial crisis due \(collateralized debt obligation, credit derivatives\). <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-12-22,73,344-->
- derivative
  - derivative / brief history
    - derivative / brief history / dislikes ::@:: There is a long tradition of disliking derivatives, going as far back as the medieval times. <p> A notable one is the Hatch and Washburn Anti-Option Bill in 1892, which would had banned futures and options trading. It passed both Houses of Congress but failed on technicalities. <!--SR:!2025-12-28,78,344!2025-12-31,81,344-->
- [questions § derivative definition](questions.md#derivative%20definition)
- [spot market](../../../../general/spot%20market.md) ::@:: It is a public financial market in which financial instruments or commodities are traded for immediate delivery. It contrasts with a futures market, in which delivery is due at a later date. <!--SR:!2025-11-24,50,324!2026-01-02,83,344-->
  - spot market / steps ::@:: These 3 steps happen \(almost\) _simultaneously_ in a _outright purchase_: Set the price \(also called _spot price_\). Transfer cash from the buyer to the seller. Transfer asset from the seller to the buyer. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-12-27,77,344-->
  - spot market / convention ::@:: In a spot market, settlement normally happens in T+2 working days, i.e., delivery of cash and commodity must be done after two working days of the trade date. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,76,344!2025-12-28,78,344-->
- [forward contract](../../../../general/forward%20contract.md) ::@:: It is a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed on in the contract, making it a type of derivative instrument. <!--SR:!2025-12-24,75,344!2025-12-27,78,344-->
  - forward contract / convention ::@:: It usually _costs nothing_ to enter. Ultimately, this is subject to agreement between the two parties. <!--SR:!2025-12-28,79,344!2025-12-02,57,324-->
  - forward contract / values ::@:: forward, maturity value, notational value, return, etc. <!--SR:!2025-12-29,79,344!2025-12-22,73,344-->
    - forward contract / values / forward price ::@:: The forward price is set such that the _value_ of the forward equals zero for both parties at the start. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-12-26,77,344-->
    - forward contract / values / maturity date ::@:: The time the purchase or sale occurs. <!--SR:!2026-01-01,82,344!2025-12-23,74,344-->
    - forward contract / values / notational value ::@:: The spot price of the underlying item _now_. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-12-25,76,344-->
  - forward contract / market ::@:: It is traded on OTC markets as they are non-standardized. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-12-28,79,344-->
  - forward contract / positions ::@:: long position: Buyer of the underlying item, as it expects its spot price to rise. <br/> short position: Seller of the underlying item, as it expects its spot price to decline. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,76,344!2025-12-25,76,344-->
  - forward contract / payoffs ::@:: The value of a forward position _at maturity_ depends on the relationship between the delivery price \($K$\) and the underlying price \($S_{T}$\) at that time. <p> - For a long position this payoff is: $f_{T}=S_{T}-K$ <br/> - For a short position, it is: $f_{T}=K-S_{T}$ <p> The payoffs for the two positions always sum to zero, making this a _zero-sum_ game. <!--SR:!2026-01-02,83,344!2025-12-31,81,344-->
    - forward contract / payoffs / interpretation ::@:: Since the final value \(at maturity\) of a forward position depends on the spot price which will then be prevailing, this contract can be viewed, from a purely financial point of view, as _"a bet on the future spot price"_. <!--SR:!2025-12-24,75,344!2025-12-22,73,344-->
  - forward contract / usage ::@:: short selling, synthetic zero-coupon bond, etc. <!--SR:!2025-12-30,80,344!2025-12-27,78,344-->
    - forward contract / usage / short selling ::@:: You want to short a stock to earn money because you expect its price will drop. Normally, you borrow the stock and sell it. Later, when the price declines, you buy the stock and repay. But this may not always be possible, perhaps due to borrowing, cost, regulations, etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,40,304!2025-11-24,50,324-->
      - forward contract / usage / short selling / solution ::@:: You can instead short a forward contract with the stock as the underlying item. The forward price should be the current stock price \(assuming no dividends\). Start a forward contract and short it. When it matures, you buy the stock and sell it at the forward price \(or use some other settlement methods, e.g. cash settlement\). <p> If the stock price has fallen, you earn from the resale, and vice versa. <!--SR:!2025-12-02,57,324!2025-12-31,81,344-->
  - forward contract / values
    - forward contract / values / return ::@:: It does not make sense to calculate return if it costs nothing to enter a forward contract. The denominator would have been zero. <p> However, sometimes you need to put up cash as _collateral_. The collateral could have been invested elsewhere. So it is the \(opportunity\) cost of the forward contract. As the collateral can be much smaller than the forward price, this is one way to _leverage_ your return \(both gain and loss\). <!--SR:!2025-12-25,76,344!2025-12-25,76,344-->
  - forward contract / usage
    - forward contract / usage / synthetic zero-coupon bond ::@:: You own some stocks. Your gains and losses are highly dependant on the stock performance. Now you want to replace them with much less volatile bonds. For simplicity, the bonds are zero-coupon bonds. <p> However, selling the stocks and then buying the bonds may be expensive \(transaction costs, etc.\) or impossible \(liquidation issues, no matching bonds, etc.\). <!--SR:!2025-11-23,49,324!2025-12-29,79,344-->
      - forward contract / usage / synthetic zero-coupon bond / solution ::@:: You can instead short a forward contract with the stock as the underlying item. The forward price should be the same as the final payment of the corresponding zero-coupon bond, calculated using the interest rate. When it matures, you sell the stock at the forward price. <p> No matter how the stock price has moved, you always receive the forward price at maturity. _Effectively_, combining the stock and the forward contract, you have a zero-coupon bond. It is _"synthetic"_ because you combine the _payoffs_ of two different financial instruments to get a payoff equivalent to a zero-coupon bond. <!--SR:!2025-12-22,73,344!2025-11-11,37,304-->
- [interest](../../../../general/interest.md) ::@:: It is payment from a debtor or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum \(that is, the amount borrowed\), at a particular rate. <!--SR:!2025-11-23,49,324!2025-12-23,74,344-->
  - interest / simple interest ::@:: It is calculated only on the principal amount, or on that portion of the principal amount that remains. It excludes the effect of compounding. <!--SR:!2025-12-01,56,324!2026-01-02,83,344-->
    - interest / simple interest / formula ::@:: Simple interest is calculated according to the following formula: $${\frac {r\cdot B\cdot m}{n} }$$ where <p> - _r_ is the simple annual [interest rate](../../../../general/interest%20rate.md) <br/> - _B_ is the initial balance <br/> - _m_ is the number of time periods elapsed and <br/> - _n_ is the frequency of applying interest. <!--SR:!2025-12-24,75,344!2025-12-30,80,344-->
- [compound interest](../../../../general/compound%20interest.md) ::@:: It is interest accumulated from a principal sum and previously accumulated interest. It is the result of reinvesting or retaining interest that would otherwise be paid out, or of the accumulation of debts from a borrower. <!--SR:!2025-12-28,79,344!2026-01-01,82,344-->
  - compound interest / continuous compounding ::@:: When the number of compounding periods per year increases without limit, continuous compounding occurs, in which case the effective annual rate approaches an upper limit of _e_<sup>_r_</sup> − 1. Continuous compounding can be regarded as letting the compounding period become infinitesimally small, achieved by taking the [limit](../../../../general/limit%20(mathematics).md) as _n_ goes to [infinity](../../../../general/infinity.md). <!--SR:!2025-12-25,76,344!2025-12-22,73,344-->
    - compound interest / continuous compounding / formula ::@:: The amount after _t_ periods of continuous compounding can be expressed in terms of the initial amount _P_<sub>0</sub> as: $$P(t)=P_{0}e^{rt}.$$ Or, finding the interest rate $r$: $$r = \frac 1 t \ln \left(\frac {P_t} {P_0}\right) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-12-30,80,344!2025-12-22,73,344-->

- topic: law of one price; forward price; rate of return; futures contract; clearing house
- [law of one price](../../../../general/law%20of%20one%20price.md) \(LOOP\) ::@:: It states that in the absence of trade frictions \(such as transport costs and tariffs\), and under conditions of free competition and price flexibility \(where no individual sellers or buyers have power to manipulate prices and prices can freely adjust\), identical goods sold at different locations should be sold for the same price when prices are expressed in a common currency. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
  - law of one price / derivatives ::@:: A security must have a single price, no matter how that security is created. For example, if an option can be created using two different sets of underlying securities, then the total price for each would be the same or else an arbitrage opportunity would exist. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
    - law of one price / derivatives / replicating portfolio ::@:: A derivative's fair value is thus derived by constructing a _replicating portfolio_ that matches its payoff and ensuring no net initial cost. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
- [arbitrage](../../../../general/arbitrage.md) ::@:: It is the practice of taking advantage of a difference in prices in two or more markets – striking a combination of matching deals to capitalize on the difference, the profit being the difference between the market prices at which the unit is traded. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
  - arbitrage / cash flows ::@:: In terms of cash flows, an arbitrage opportunity _potentially_ generates a _profit_ today or in the future, while _never_ incurring a _loss_ today or in the future. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
- [forward price](../../../../general/forward%20price.md) ::@:: It is the agreed upon price of an asset in a forward contract. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
  - forward price / derivation ::@:: Construct two portfolios with the same payoffs at all times. In particular, they have the same payoff at time $T$: <p> 1. Long the forward with forward price $N_0 F_{0, T}$. Present payoff: $0$ <br/> 2. Short a zero‑coupon bond with face value $N_0F_{0,T}$ and buy the underlying asset. Present payoff: $N_0 (S_0 - F_{0, T} e^{-r_0 T})$ <p> As they have the same future payoffs, they should have the same present payoff: $$N_0(S_0 - F_{0, T} e^{-r_0 T}) = 0 \implies F_{0, T} = N_0 S_0 e^{r_0 T} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
    - forward price / derivation / violation ::@:: If the quoted forward deviates from this value, a trader can lock in a risk‑free profit by simultaneously taking opposite positions \(long and short\) in the two portfolios. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-06,15,348-->
  - forward price / expected spot price at maturity ::@:: The forward price \(at maturity\) depends only on current spot $S_0$ and current interest rate $r_0$; it does not predict future movements of the asset, i.e. expected spot price at maturity $E[S_T]$. <p> Expected log‑return $\mu_0$ is derived from $E[S_T]=S_0e^{\mu_0T}$. Its difference with the current interest rate $\mu_0-r_0$ is the _risk premium_ and should be positive for risky assets, e.g. stocks. \(Later, we see the risk premium is supposed to be zero for currencies.\) <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-05,14,348-->
- [rate of return](../../../../general/rate%20of%20return.md) ::@:: In finance, __return__ is a profit on an investment. It comprises any change in value of the investment, and/or cash flows \(or securities, or other investments\) which the investor receives from that investment over a specified time period, such as interest payments, coupons, cash dividends and stock dividends. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - rate of return / simple return ::@:: $$(S_T-S_0)/S_0 = S_T / S_0 - 1 \,;$$ annualized by dividing by $T$. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - rate of return / log return ::@:: $$\ln(S_T/S_0) \,;$$ annualized by dividing by $T$. <p> Using the _expected_ spot price $E[S_T]$ instead of $S_T$ gives its _expected_ value instead. It, annualized, gives the continuously‑compounded rate $\mu_0$. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
- forward contract
  - forward contract / value ::@:: Initially, the value of a forward contract is 0. <p> At time $t<T$, the forward price becomes $F_{t,T}=S_t\,e^{r(T-t)}$. The current value to the long \(the buyer\) is the discounted difference between the original forward and the new one: $$V_t = N_0 e^{-r(T-t)}(F_{t,T}-F_{0,T}) \,.$$ Its value is negated to the short \(the seller\). <p> To remember the order, remember that the long benefits from higher spot prices, which increases $F_{t, T}$, so it should be the term before minus. Reverse this for the short. <!--SR:!2025-11-01,10,328!2025-11-16,25,368-->
    - forward contract / value / no arbitrage ::@:: The forward's value to the short \(the seller\) equals what you would receive today if you sold it and entered a _reverse_ forward \(long\) to settle at maturity. Since that reverse contract's payoff is $N_0(S_T-F_{t,T})$, adding the two gives the net risk‑free amount $N_0(F_{0,T}-F_{t,T})$. Discounting this amount back to today gives the current value, which multiplies the amount by $e^{-r (T - t)}$, <!--SR:!2025-11-01,10,328!2025-11-16,25,368-->
    - forward contract / value / intuition ::@:: Treat the payoff at maturity as a cash flow at maturity. Then the value of the forward contract is said payoff discounted back to today. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
- [questions § forward contracts](questions.md#forward%20contracts)
- forward price
  - forward price / derivation
    - forward price / derivation / dividend yield ::@:: When there is _dividend yield_ on a stock \(or in general, _convenience yield_\), the asset yields benefits to the holder. <p> In a forward contract, the seller transfers the asset at maturity. The benefits it obtain while holding the asset must be accounted for. For a _continuously-compounded_ dividend yield $q$, we have $$F_{0, T} = N_0 S_0 e^{(r - q) T} \,.$$ <p> Intuitively, the buyer gets to buy the asset at maturity for cheaper because it forgoes the benefits from holding the asset. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
- [futures contract](../../../../general/futures%20contract.md) ::@:: It is a standardized legal contract to buy or sell something at a predetermined price for delivery at a specified time in the future, between parties not yet known to each other. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
  - futures contract / vs. forward contract ::@:: - Futures are exchange‑traded, standardized contracts with daily _mark‑to‑market_ settlements and margin requirements. <br/> - Forward contracts are OTC, bespoke, and settled at maturity without intermediate cash flows. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
    - futures contract / vs. forward contract / settlement ::@:: Futures settle daily through _mark‑to‑market_; gains/losses are posted to margin accounts each trading day. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
    - futures contract / vs. forward contract / counterparty risk ::@:: Cleared by an exchange's clearinghouse that becomes the counterparty to both sides, eliminating default risk. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
    - futures contract / vs. forward contract / liquidity & standardization ::@:: Uniform contract specifications reduce illiquidity but can create a mismatch between contract terms and individual hedging needs. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-05,14,348-->
  - futures contract / mark‑to‑market ::@:: At day's end the exchange calculates each trader's unrealized gains or losses. If losses exceed the maintenance margin, a margin call forces additional collateral; otherwise the position is liquidated. This daily settlement eliminates counterparty default risk—no U.S. clearinghouse has ever failed to pay. <!--SR:!2025-11-05,14,348!2025-11-14,23,368-->
  - futures contract / position reversal ::@:: Either side may close out or reverse its contract at any time by taking an opposite position \(e.g., a long becomes short\). <p> Example: A trader who went long five S&P&nbsp;500 futures for December delivery can today offset the exposure by going short five contracts of the same expiry. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
- clearing house
  - clearing house / risk ::@:: The clearinghouse acts as the counterparty to both legs of every trade but does not assume significant market risk. <p> Because it neutralizes bilateral exposures, systemic shocks \(e.g., Lehman Brothers' collapse\) would have been mitigated if derivative positions were cleared centrally. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
- futures contract
  - futures contract / underlying assets ::@:: commodities \(softs, metals, energy\), currencies, equity indices, interest‑rate instruments, weather and electricity products, etc. <p> For more: <https://www.cmegroup.com/> <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
  - futures contract / mark‑to‑market
    - futures contract / mark‑to‑market / futures price ::@:: At inception \(time 0\) the short sets a _futures price_ $F_{0,T}$ at which they will sell the asset to the long, with delivery on maturity $T$. After each trading day the market quotes a new futures price $F_{t,T}$. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
    - futures contract / mark‑to‑market / daily profit and loss ::@:: - The long's daily P&L is $$\text{P\&L}_t = \text{contract size} \times (F_{t,T}-F_{(t-1),T}) \,.$$ The short's daily P&L is the negative of this value; gains for one side are losses for the other, maintaining a zero‑sum game. <p> To remember this, the long wants higher futures price \(which is correlated with the current spot price\). <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
    - futures contract / mark‑to‑market / posting profit and loss ::@:: At the _end_ of every day, after accounting for interest on each trader's margin account, the daily profit and loss is posted to each trader's margin account according to their positions. <p> Intuitively, if a trader holds a _long_ position from time 0 to time $t$, its _accumulated_ P&L from the trade is: $$F_{t, T} - F_{0, T} \,,$$ and _negated_ for the short. Note this accumulated value ignores the time value of money \(risk-free interest\). <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-06,15,348-->
  - futures contract / settlement ::@:: Futures may settle _physically_ \(delivery of the underlying asset\) or _in cash_ \(net payment\). <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
    - futures contract / settlement / physical ::@:: Some futures \(e.g., agricultural products, energy, metals\) settle by physical delivery of the underlying asset. <p> The final settlement price is usually the spot price at maturity \(as P&L from changes in future price are marked-to-market daily\), but some contracts specify a particular index or formula. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
    - futures contract / settlement / in cash ::@:: Most financial futures \(e.g., equity indices, interest rates\) settle in cash. The final settlement price is usually the spot price at maturity \(as P&L from changes in future price are marked-to-market daily\), but some contracts specify a particular index or formula. <!--SR:!2025-11-08,17,348!2025-11-08,17,348-->
  - futures contract / delivery ::@:: Each futures contract is identified by a delivery month and specific settlement dates set by the exchange. Physical delivery, when chosen, can only occur on those pre‑designated dates. The contract also stipulates the exact location where the asset must be delivered; this address or venue is fixed at contract initiation. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - futures contract / margin ::@:: Both sides deposit collateral with the exchange when a futures position opens; this collateral limits counterparty risk. <p> The exchange sets the required initial and maintenance levels, adjusting them regularly based on market volatility \(higher volatility → higher margins\). <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
    - futures contract / margin / margin call ::@:: At _market close_ each day, unrealized gains are credited and losses debited from the trader's margin account \(after accounting for interest\). <p> If a trader's margin balance falls below the maintenance threshold, the exchange issues a _margin call_ demanding additional funds to restore the _initial_ margin \(not _maintenance_ margin\). Failure to meet the call results in automatic liquidation of the position. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
  - futures contract / mark-to-market
    - futures contract / mark-to-market / example ::@:: An example with multiple steps to understand the mark-to-market mechanism: determine notional exposure → compute initial margin → account for interest → compute maintenance margin → compute margin call trigger → interpret results <!--SR:!2025-11-06,15,348!2025-11-14,23,368-->
      - futures contract / mark-to-market / example / determine notional exposure ::@:: - Notional = Spot price × Contract size \(units per contract\) × Number of contracts. <br/> - _Example:_ Spot = 950; size = 250 units; 10 contracts → $950×250×10 = \$2,375,000$. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
      - futures contract / mark-to-market / example / compute initial margin ::@:: - Initial margin = Initial‑margin% × Notional. <br/> - _Example:_ 10% of \$2,375,000 = __\$237,500__. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-13,18,348-->
      - futures contract / mark-to-market / example / account for interest ::@:: - Margin balance after Δt days \(or weeks\) grows at the continuously‑compounded rate \(r\): $$M_{\Delta t}=M_0\,e^{r\Delta t}$$ <br/> - _Example:_ 6% per annum, one week \($\Delta t=1/52$\) → $\$237{,}500 \times e^{0.06/52}\approx\$237{,}774.20$ <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->

      - futures contract / mark-to-market / example / compute maintenance margin ::@:: - Maintenance margin = Maintenance-margin-of-initial-margin% × Initial-margin \(or a fixed amount\). <br/> - _Example:_ 80% of initial → $0.8×\$237{,}500 = \$190{,}000$. <!--SR:!2025-11-13,18,348!2025-11-14,23,368-->
      - futures contract / mark-to-market / example / compute margin call trigger ::@:: - Assuming futures price always equal spot, _loss_ on the _long_ position when spot falls to $X$ is $$L = N_{\text{contracts}}\times(\text{contract size})\times(S_0-X) = N_0 (S_0 - X)$$ <br/>  - The margin account after realizing this loss becomes $$M_{\Delta t} - L$$ <br/> - Set this equal to the maintenance level and solve for X: $$\begin{aligned} M_{\Delta t} - N_0\,(S_0-X) & = \text{Maintenance} \\ X & = S_0 - \frac{M_{\Delta t}-\text{Maintenance}}{N_0} \,. \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-11-08,17,348!2025-11-05,14,348-->
      - futures contract / mark-to-market / example / interpret results ::@:: - If the market moves such that the futures price falls below the calculated $X$, the trader's margin balance would dip under maintenance and a margin call is issued. <br/> - Conversely, if the price stays above $X$, no call occurs and the position can remain open. <br/> - If the price is exactly $X$ \(very unlikely\), it depends on the exchange. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->

- topic: commodity forwards; forward curve; contango; backwardation; cost of carry; convenience yield
- forward contract
  - forward contract / commodity forwards ::@:: Commodity forwards differ from financial forwards in several key aspects, including storage costs, convenience yields, and settlement methods. <p> While a financial forward price is given by $F_{0,T}=S_0e^{(r-q)T}$, where $q$ is the dividend yield, commodity forwards are subject to additional factors such as storage costs and convenience yields that can make the pricing more complex. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,18,348!2025-11-09,18,348-->
    - forward contract / commodity forwards / vs. financial forwards ::@:: Financial forwards must have a spot price, storable, _no_ carry cost \(apart from the opportunity cost\), easy to borrow \(unless in market stress\), and settle in cash. <p> Commodity forwards may be yes or no in the aforementioned 5 aspects. Additionally, they have non-pecuniary uses and lease markets. <!--SR:!2025-11-08,17,348!2025-11-16,25,368-->
    - forward contract / commodity forwards / examples ::@:: Examples include agricultural products like wheat and corn, energy commodities such as oil and natural gas, and metals like gold and silver. Each of these commodities has unique characteristics affecting their forward pricing. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
- [forward curve](../../../../general/forward%20curve.md) ::@:: It is a function graph in finance that defines the prices at which a contract for future delivery or payment can be concluded today. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
  - forward curve / example ::@:: For example, a futures contract forward curve is (annotation: forward) prices being plotted as a function of the amount of time between now and the expiry date of the futures contract (with the spot price being the price at time zero). <p> Simply put, it plots $F_{0, t}$ against $t$, where $t = 0$ is now, which is also when you start the contract. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
  - forward curve / shapes ::@:: flat, contango, \(normal\) backwardation; mixture \(of contango and backwardation\) <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
- [contango](../../../../general/contango.md) ::@:: It is a situation in which the futures price (or forward price) of a commodity is higher than the spot price. In practice, the expected future spot price is unknown, and the term refers to "negative basis" where the future price is trading above the _current_ spot price. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-01,10,328-->
  - contango / forward curve ::@:: A forward curve depicting the \(forward\) prices of multiple contracts, all for the same good, but of different maturities, _rises_ with maturity. Simply put, $F_{0, t}$ increases as $t$ increases, where $t = 0$ is now, which is also when you start the contract. <p> \(__this course__: Use this as the definition.\) <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - contango / forward price ::@:: However, tracking the forward price of contracts of a fixed maturity date, it _falls_, reaching the then-prevailing spot price at maturity. <p> Simply put, $F_{t, T}$ decreases as $t$ increases, where $t = 0$ is a fixed time, $t$ is now, which is also when you start the contract, and $t \le T$ is another fixed time. It also explains why it approaches the then-prevailing spot price: $F_{T, T} = S_T$. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - contango / occurrences ::@:: It is the usual case when interest rates \(can be treated as _opportunity cost_ of holding the asset\) exceed storage or convenience yields. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
- [normal backwardation](../../../../general/normal%20backwardation.md) ::@:: It is the market condition where the price of a commodity's forward or futures contract is trading below the expected spot price at contract maturity. In practice, the expected future spot price is unknown, and the term may refer to "positive basis", which occurs when the _current_ spot price exceeds the price of the future. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - normal backwardation / forward curve ::@:: A forward curve depicting the \(forward\) prices of multiple contracts, all for the same good, but of different maturities, _falls_ with maturity. Simply put, $F_{0, t}$ decreases as $t$ increases, where $t = 0$ is now, which is also when you start the contract. <p> \(__this course__: Use this as the definition.\) <!--SR:!2025-11-05,14,348!2025-11-14,23,368-->
  - normal backwardation / forward price ::@:: However, tracking the forward price of the same contract as it approaches maturity, it _rises_, reaching the then-prevailing spot price at maturity. <p> Simply put, $F_{t, T}$ increases as $t$ increases, where $t = 0$ is a fixed time, $t$ is now, which is also when you start the contract, and $t \le T$ is another fixed time. It also explains why it approaches the then-prevailing spot price: $F_{T, T} = S_T$. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
  - contango / occurrences ::@:: It typically reflecting high demand‑to‑inventory ratios and large convenience yields, exceeding interest rates \(can be treated as _opportunity cost_ of holding the asset\). <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
- [cost of carry](../../../../general/cost%20of%20carry.md) ::@:: It is the cost of holding a security or a physical commodity over a period of time. <p> It includes interest rates $r$ \(positive\), storage cost $\lambda$ \(positive\), convenience yield $y$ \(negative\), and any future cash flows from holding the security \(negative if positive cash flow, positive if negative cash flow\). <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-06,15,348-->
  - cost of carry / security ::@:: If long, the cost of carry is the cost of interest paid on a margin account. Conversely, if short \(where you borrow a security and sell it for cash\), the cost of carry is the cost of paying dividends, or rather the opportunity cost; the cost of purchasing a particular security rather than an alternative. <p> This actually explains the $e^{rT}$ term in the forward price above. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-09,18,348-->
  - cost of carry / commodities ::@:: It may also refer to the _storage cost_ only for commodities. Storing physical commodities (e.g., wheat, blueberries, electricity) incurs warehousing, cooling, insurance, and other expenses that can vary with time. \(__this course__: use this definition.\) <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
  - cost of carry / forward price ::@:: In the forward pricing formula this appears as a continuously compounded storage cost $\lambda$: $$F_{0,T}=S_0 e^{(r+\lambda)T} \,.$$ <p> If we use the more _general_ definition of cost of carry \(i.e. not the above definition\), then $r + \lambda$ is the cost of carry. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - cost of carry / contango ::@:: Positive cost of carry alone push the curve into contango. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
- [convenience yield](../../../../general/convenience%20yield.md) ::@:: It is an implied return on holding inventories. It is an adjustment to the cost of carry in the non-arbitrage pricing formula for forward prices in markets with trading constraints. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - convenience yield / rationale ::@:: Physical possession of a commodity can be valuable to users who need certainty of supply (e.g., food manufacturers). A key determinant is _demand‑to‑inventory ratios_. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
    - convenience yield / rationale / demand-to-inventory ratio ::@:: Traders or producers who need guaranteed supply \(e.g., food manufacturers needing corn\) will pay a higher convenience yield during tight inventory periods. Investors who are indifferent to physical delivery \(pure speculators\) might ignore the convenience yield when it is low. <p> In short, the greater the demand‑to‑inventory ratio, the larger the convenience yield, because scarcity increases the value of having immediate, reliable access to the commodity. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-09,18,348-->
  - convenience yield / forward price ::@:: This extra value is captured by the _convenience yield_ $y$, which effectively subtracts from storage costs: $$F_{0,T}=S_0 e^{(r+\lambda-y)T}$$ <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - convenience yield / backwardation ::@:: A sufficiently large convenience yield can reverse contango into backwardation, explaining why some markets show declining forward prices with maturity. <!--SR:!2025-11-06,15,348!2025-11-14,23,368-->
- futures contract
  - futures contract / commodities ::@:: A commodity futures contract obligates the buyer and seller to exchange a specified quantity of a commodity at a predetermined price on a future date. <p> Exchange specifications (e.g., NYMEX crude oil) include delivery months, trading cut‑offs, uniform delivery within the month, contract size (1000 barrels for crude), and specific delivery locations (Cushing, Oklahoma). <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
    - futures contract / commodities / examples ::@:: - _Oil_: In a backwardated market (high demand relative to inventory), short sellers receive a premium by locking in lower future prices. <br/> - _Gold_: A December purchase of ten gold futures contracts at \$500/oz for delivery on 15 Dec demonstrates how the contract size and settlement mechanics work without any initial cash outlay. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->

- topic: Metallgesellschaft; forward curve slope trading; forward contract risks
- [Metallgesellschaft](../../../../general/Metallgesellschaft.md) ::@:: It was formerly one of Germany's largest industrial conglomerates based in Frankfurt. It had over 20,000 employees and revenues in excess of 10 billion US dollars. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - Metallgesellschaft / hedging debacle ::@:: In 1993, the company lost 1.3 billion dollars suffering from flawed long hedge strategy in near term futures contracts that was meant to protect against forward sales commitments. A fall in spot prices forced margin calls for the company and the contracts were closed at a loss. Subsequently, the spot price increased and the company suffered even greater losses covering its customer commitments. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
    - Metallgesellschaft / hedging debacle / forward sales ::@:: MG launched long‑term fixed‑rate forward sales of heating oil/gasoline in the early 1990s, offering contracts with a ten‑year maturity at spot at initiation plus a premium of \$3–\$5. It charged customers this one constant monthly price for 10 years. <p> As they are selling the underlying, they are the _short_ on these forward sales. As the delivery occurs every month, it can be treated as a series of short positions. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-09,18,348-->
    - Metallgesellschaft / hedging debacle / ideal strategy ::@:: They would have liked to hedge each 10‑year short position with an identical long forward or futures contract of the same size and maturity. <p> Because the market only provides liquidity for a few months, that exact hedging wasn't possible—hence MG's strategy relied on a large premium of \$3–5 to compensate for the lack of matching long contracts. \(Otherwise they could not get into the business in the first place.\) <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
    - Metallgesellschaft / hedging debacle / stack and roll ::@:: - __stack__: At the beginning of each month it buys a large quantity of one‑month futures contracts that match the notional amount it expects to deliver for the entire ten year forward sales. <br/> - __roll__: When the one‑month contract expires, MG delivers the physical oil to its customer at the fixed forward price \(the "short" side\). Simultaneously, the futures position that just expired is closed out, the delivered physical oil is sold \(or with payoff settled in cash\), and a new set of one‑month contracts is purchased for the next delivery month. This rolling process repeats every month. <p> As they are buying the underlying, they are the _long_ on these one-month futures contracts. <!--SR:!2025-11-05,14,348!2025-11-06,15,348-->
    - Metallgesellschaft / hedging debacle / risk hedging ::@:: By always being long the nearest‑maturity futures, MG offsets price movements in the spot market: if oil prices rise, it loses on its forward sale but gains on the futures; if prices fall, the reverse occurs. The roll keeps the hedge aligned with the current delivery schedule. <p> Since one‑month contracts are highly liquid, MG can execute these large "stacks" without moving market prices too much, whereas longer‑dated forwards would be illiquid and expensive to trade. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
    - Metallgesellschaft / hedging debacle / intuition ::@:: The price with premium is $P$. Consider a forward sales maturity two months later. Using stack and roll, this forward sales is hedged by two one-month futures contracts, one bought now and the other bought one month later. Consider three scenarios: _no hedging_, _ideal hedging_, and _stack and roll_. <!--SR:!2025-11-20,24,392!2025-11-20,24,392-->
      - Metallgesellschaft / hedging debacle / intuition / no hedging ::@:: Payoff is $P - S_2$. It is subject to the then-prevailing spot price. <!--SR:!2025-11-20,24,392!2025-11-20,24,392-->
      - Metallgesellschaft / hedging debacle / intuition / ideal hedging ::@:: Payoff is $(P - S_2) + (S_2 - F_{0, 2}) = P - F_{0, 2}$, the spot price is insured against the then-prevailing spot price. The premium of \$3–\$5 \(difference between $P$ and $F_{0, 2}$\) is locked in. <!--SR:!2025-11-20,24,392!2025-11-20,24,392-->
      - Metallgesellschaft / hedging debacle / intuition / stack and roll ::@:: Payoff is $(P - S_2) + (S_2 - F_{1, 2}) + (S_1 - F_{0, 1}) = (P - F_{1, 2}) + (S_1 - F_{0, 1})$. We see the hedge is not perfect: whether the market is currently in contango \(lose because $F_{t, t + 1} > S_{t + 1}$\) or backwardation \(gain because $F_{t, t + 1} < S_{t + 1}$\) matters. However, we assume the forward curve is always flat \(i.e. $F_{t, t + 1} = S_t$\), we get $P - F_{0, 1}$. <p> Intuitively, with stack and roll, we see risk from changing spot price is replaced by the risk from by how much the market is in contango or backwardation. <p> If we _assume_ the market stays in contango \(lose\) or backwardation \(gain\) with equal severity \(in terms of duration and pricing\) over a long period \(e.g. 10 years\), then stack and roll gives similar payoff to ideal hedging at the forward sales' maturity. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,14,328!2025-11-01,10,328-->
    - Metallgesellschaft / hedging debacle / cash flow risk ::@:: From intuition, with stack and roll, we see risk from changing spot price is replaced by the risk from by how much the market is in contango or backwardation. <p> If we _assume_ the market stays in contango \(lose\) or backwardation \(gain\) with equal severity \(in terms of duration and pricing\) over a long period \(e.g. 10 years\), then stack and roll gives similar payoff to ideal hedging at the forward sales' maturity. <p> There will be temporary losses \(from contango\) or gains \(from backwardation\) before the forward sales' maturity, which creates a _cash flow risk_ if MG does not have enough liquidity to deal with temporary losses \(obviously, temporary gains are fine\). <!--SR:!2025-11-01,10,328!2025-11-15,24,368-->
    - Metallgesellschaft / hedging debacle / problem ::@:: In practice, MG suffered massive cash‑flow losses during a shift to contango in 1992 because the one‑month futures were priced above spot, forcing MG to buy oil at higher prices while still selling it at fixed forward rates. Additional factors—market liquidity constraints beyond a few months, traders exploiting MG's large trades \(remember forwards are a zero-sum game\), and stricter U.S. margin requirements—exacerbated the losses, ultimately leading to a cessation of hedging. The forward sales commitments became naked, so MG only had _short_ positions. But the price increased, leading to a collapse in MG's financial position. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-08,17,348-->
- forward curve
  - forward curve / slope trading ::@:: When the market transitions from contango to backwardation, a trader can profit by taking a long position on near‑term forwards and a short position on longer‑dated forwards. Regardless of whether spot moves up, stays flat, or falls, the net payoff remains positive when the curve's slope changes as predicted. <p> The converse applies for transitions from backwardation to contango. To remember the direction, if the _expected_ slope is negative \(e.g. contango to backwardation\), \(short-term\) long ↘ short \(long-term\). If the _expected_ slope is positive \(e.g. backwardation to contango\), \(short-term\) short ↗ long \(long-term\). <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
    - forward curve / slope trading / execution ::@:: Again, you always hold two forwards with _opposite_ positions. <p> Initially, you hold opposite positions on a short-term forward and a long-term forward. <p> When the short-term forward matures, the remaining long-term forward either has a _long_ position or _short_ position. You want to match it with another short-term forward maturing at the same time as the long-term forward but with _opposite_ position. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-13,18,348-->
    - forward curve / slope trading / intuition ::@:: By always holding two forwards with _opposite_ positions, changes in the spot prices are insured against. The payoff becomes determined by how much the market is in contango or backwardation. This is the same intuition as that for MG hedging debacle. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-05,14,348-->
    - forward curve / slope trading / payoff ::@:: Assume two months. If we expect the market to transit from contango to backwardation, we take the following positions: \(short-term\) long ↘ short \(long-term\). <p> Payoff is $$(F_{0, 2} - S_2) + (S_1 - F_{0, 1}) + (S_2 - F_{1, 2}) = F_{0, 2} + S_1 - F_{0, 1} - F_{1, 2} = (S_1 - F_{1, 2}) - (F_{0, 1} - F_{0, 2}) \,.$$ Writing $S_1 = F_{1, 1}$, we see the payoff is the change of the _difference_ in prices of those two fixed maturity dates. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,18,348!2025-11-09,18,348-->
- [questions § futures contracts](questions.md#futures%20contracts)
- forward contract
  - forward contract / risk components ::@:: Spot‑price volatility can be hedged effectively using short‑term forwards or futures rolled over time. <p> In contrast, the convenience yield is a key, often unobservable, factor that shapes commodity forward prices; its variability introduces risk tied to the _shape_ of the forward curve (contango/backwardation). The uncertainty in the convenience yield \(and thus the slope of the curve\) is harder to hedge and can cause persistent losses if not managed properly. <p> This ties to the above intuition that MG hedging debacle and slope trading replaces the spot-price volatility risk by the uncertainty risk in the forward curve slope. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-08,17,348-->

- topic: currency; exchange rate; foreign exchange spot; currency future; forward exchange rate
- [currency](../../../../general/currency.md) ::@:: It is a standardization of money in any form, in use or circulation as a medium of exchange, for example banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a _system of money_ in common use within a specific environment over time, especially for people in a nation state. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - currency / characteristics ::@:: commodity currencies, pegged currencies, reserve currencies, etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
  - currency / reserve currencies ::@:: The _U.S. dollar_ dominates as the world's reserve currency, widely held by central banks and used for international trade; it is considered a "safe‑haven" \(like gold\) but still subject to volatility \(i.e. not risk-free\). <p> The _euro_ competes as a second major reserve currency and can move against the dollar; other significant currencies include the Japanese yen, British pound, Swiss franc, etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
  - currency / commodity currencies ::@:: These countries depend greatly on the export of certain raw materials: Australian dollar \(a commodity‑linked "commodity currency"\), Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - currency / pegged currencies ::@:: Hong Kong's dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at an almost fixed rate \(≈0.129 USD per HKD\); similar peg arrangements exist for Saudi riyal, Qatari riyal, and other currencies. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-08,17,348-->
- [exchange rate](../../../../general/exchange%20rate.md) ::@:: It is the rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another currency. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - exchange rate / quote ::@:: Exchange rates are quoted as _quote currency_ per unit of _base currency_ \(e.g., USD/JPY = 104 means one USD costs 104 JPY\). Misreading the quote can lead to serious errors. <p> For a quote like CHF/USD = 1.01, the reciprocal \(USD/CHF\) is 0.9901; always verify which convention is used before trading. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,18,348!2025-11-08,17,348-->
    - exchange rate / quote / intuition ::@:: Treat the currency on the left \(_base_ currency\) as the "product". Treat the currency on the right \(_quote_ currency\) as the _price unit_ for the "product". <p> Using the same currency on the right, typically USD, then the exchange rates for different currencies on the left can be treated as the "_value_" \(higher is more valuable\) of the currency on the left, and can be directly compared. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
- [foreign exchange spot](../../../../general/foreign%20exchange%20spot.md) ::@:: It is an agreement between two parties to buy one currency against selling another currency at an agreed price for settlement on the spot date. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
- [currency future](../../../../general/currency%20future.md) ::@:: It is a futures contract to exchange one currency for another at a specified date in the future at a price (exchange rate) that is fixed on the purchase date; see Foreign exchange derivative. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
  - currency future / quote ::@:: Typically, one of the currencies is the US dollar. The _price_ of a future is then in terms of US dollars per unit of other currency. This can be different from the standard way of quoting in the spot foreign exchange markets. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
  - currency future / uses ::@:: hedging against foreign exchange risk, speculating to attempt to profit with risk of a loss <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
  - currency future / hedging ::@:: If an investor will receive cash denominated in a foreign currency on some future date, the current exchange rate can be locked in by entering into an offsetting currency futures position that expires on the date the cash is due, used only if the rate worsens. <p> \(__this course__: We assume we always settle the currency futures position, no matter if the rate worsens or not.\) <!--SR:!2025-11-08,17,348!2025-11-15,24,368-->
    - currency future / hedging / example ::@:: A U.S. asset‑management firm considers investing \$1 million in one‑year government bonds either in Hong Kong or London. <p> Assumptions: continuous interest rate of 2.96% in all three economies; spot rates HKD/USD = 0.129, GBP/USD = 1.429. <p> Hong Kong's peg implies the future spot will remain at 0.129; the GBP is expected to fluctuate between 1.658 and 1.200 with equal probability. <p> Payoff calculations show that without hedging, investment in London yields a range of outcomes (≈\$1.195 M if GBP appreciates, ≈\$0.865 M if it depreciates), while Hong Kong investment is fixed at \$1.03 M. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
      - currency future / hedging / example / solution ::@:: Currency forwards are zero‑value contracts at initiation; the long side buys the foreign currency at maturity by paying a predetermined forward price $F_{0,T}$ in terms of the _quote currency_. <p> The U.S. investor shorts a GBP forward (locks in an exchange rate of \$1.429 per £1) with a notational value that will convert all GBP to USD at maturity, thereby offsetting potential depreciation/appreciation. <p> Combined payoff analysis shows that, regardless of GBP movement, the total return from the bond investment plus the forward hedge equals the fixed USD amount of \$1.03M. <!--SR:!2025-11-08,17,348!2025-11-15,24,368-->
      - currency future / hedging / example / counterparty ::@:: The counterparty to the forward contract could be a bank or another financial institution, which, in this example, are British firms going long on GBP forward \(convert USD to GBP\). <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
- [forward exchange rate](../../../../general/forward%20exchange%20rate.md) ::@:: It is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
  - forward exchange rate / no-arbitrage derivation ::@:: With USD as quote currency: $$F_{0,T} = S_0\,e^{(r-r^*)T}$$ where $S_0$ is spot, $r$ the domestic continuous rate, and $r^*$ the foreign rate \(interpreted as a dividend yield from holding the foreign currency\). <p> If this parity fails, arbitrage opportunities arise: <p> - _If_ $F_{0,T} > S_0 e^{(r-r^*)T}$, short the forward \(short foreign currency\), borrow USD \(short USD\), convert to foreign currency at spot, invest abroad \(long foreign currency\); <br/> - _If_ $F_{0,T} < S_0 e^{(r-r^*)T}$, reverse the trade. <p> As it involves using forward contracts, this is known as _covered interest rate parity_ \(CIP\), emphasis on "_covered_". <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
    - forward exchange rate / no-arbitrage derivation / intuition ::@:: $r$ is simply the _opportunity cost_ of holding the underlying \(base currency\) instead of the quote currency. <p> $r^*$ is simply the _opportunity cost_ of holding the quote currency instead of the underlying \(base currency\). It can be treated as the _dividend gain_ of holding the underlying \(base currency\), so needs to be subtracted. <!--SR:!2025-11-08,14,348!2025-11-09,15,348-->

- topic: short squeeze; interest rate parity; covered interest rate parity; uncovered interest rate parity; uncovered interest arbitrage; carry; currency carry trade; Chinese copper carry trade
- [questions § currency forwards and futures](questions.md#currency%20forwards%20and%20futures)
- [short squeeze](../../../../general/short%20squeeze.md) ::@:: It is a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals. It occurs when demand has increased relative to supply because short sellers have to buy stock to cover their short positions. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
  - short squeeze / first ::@:: In 1894 the Russian government engineered a forced‑sell of rubles on the Berlin Bourse, where large volumes of short‑positioned rubles had accumulated. <p> Finance Minister Serguei Witte instructed Berlin agents to purchase vast amounts of ruble notes for forward delivery, then abruptly halted ruble exports from Russia. <p> With no way for all short sellers to deliver the required rubles, Witte's intervention created a squeeze; the state ultimately supplied extra rubles but at a price set far above market value. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
- [interest rate parity](../../../../general/interest%20rate%20parity.md) ::@:: It is a no-arbitrage condition representing an equilibrium state under which investors compare interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
  - interest rate parity / covered interest rate parity \(CIP\) ::@:: When the no-arbitrage condition is satisfied _with_ the use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be _covered_. Investors will still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,18,348!2025-11-14,23,368-->
    - interest rate parity / covered interest rate parity / formulation ::@:: With USD as quote currency: $$F_{0,T} = S_0\,e^{(r-r^*)T}$$ where $S_0$ is spot, $r$ the domestic continuous rate, and $r^*$ the foreign rate \(interpreted as a dividend yield from holding the foreign currency\). <p> If this parity fails, arbitrage opportunities arise: <p> - _If_ $F_{0,T} > S_0 e^{(r-r^*)T}$, short the forward \(short foreign currency\), borrow USD \(short USD\), convert to foreign currency at spot, invest abroad \(long foreign currency\); <br/> - _If_ $F_{0,T} < S_0 e^{(r-r^*)T}$, reverse the trade. <p> It is the same as the no-arbitrage derivation for currency forwards. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-06,15,348-->
    - interest rate parity / covered interest rate parity / violation ::@:: During the 2008‑09 financial crisis, empirical graphs of EUR/USD and GBP/USD forward spreads show significant deviations from theory during the crisis. For most of the time, the forward price \(in terms of USD\) is higher than expected given the risk-free interest rates. <p> This can be treated as there is _holding cost_ to hold the underlying \(non-USD\), so the cost of carry becomes $r - r^* + c$, making the forward price higher than expected. Conversely, using USD/EUR and USD/GBP prices, there is _convenience yield_ to hold the underlying \(USD\), so the cost of carry becomes $r^* - r - c$, making the forward price lower than expected. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-06,15,348-->
      - interest rate parity / covered interest rate parity / violation / reason ::@:: The classic arbitrage (short forward, borrow USD, convert to euro, invest in euros) was infeasible because U.S. dollars became scarce; banks hoarded dollars as collateral ("convenience yield"). <p> General reasons why arbitrage may fail during market stress: <p> - Limited borrowing capacity due to risk aversion of lenders. <br/> - Funding and execution risk due to more frequent margin calls, which can close arbitrage positions prematurely. <br/> - Fear of withdrawals, causing \(hedge\) funds to prematurely close risky positions such as arbitrage positions. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-06,15,348-->
  - interest rate parity / uncovered interest rate parity \(UIP\) ::@:: When the no-arbitrage condition is satisfied _without_ the use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be _uncovered_. Risk-neutral investors will be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the exchange rate between those countries is expected to adjust such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on euro deposits, thereby eliminating the potential for uncovered interest arbitrage profits. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,18,348!2025-11-08,17,348-->
    - interest rate parity / uncovered interest rate parity / formulation ::@:: With USD as quote currency: $$E_0[S_T] = S_0\,e^{(r-r^*)T}$$ where $E_0[S_T]$ is expected future spot, $S_0$ is spot, $r$ the domestic continuous rate, and $r^*$ the foreign rate \(interpreted as a dividend yield from holding the foreign currency\). <p> If we assume CIP holds, it may be derived by setting the expected future spot to forward rates $E_0[S_T] = F_{0, T}$. This can be justified: While a stock's forward price diverges from its expected spot due to an unhedgeable risk premium, an exchange rate is inherently a zero‑sum bet between two parties. What one side fears \(depreciation\) is the other's gain \(appreciation\), so the market naturally aligns forward rates with expected future spot levels. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
    - interest rate parity / uncovered interest rate parity / empirical ::@:: We can fit a _linear regression_ to test it: $$\ln \frac {S_{t + T} } {S_{t} } = \alpha + \beta \left(r_t - r_t^*\right) T + \varepsilon_{T} \,.$$ If UIP holds, then $\beta = 1$. <p> In practice, empirical regressions often find the UIP coefficient \(_β_\) significantly below 1, sometimes negative—an unresolved puzzle. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
  - interest rate parity / uncovered vs. covered ::@:: The former links the expected future spot price to the current spot price, while the latter links the currency forward price to the current spot price. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
- [uncovered interest arbitrage](../../../../general/covered%20interest%20arbitrage.md) ::@:: It is an arbitrage trading strategy whereby an investor capitalizes on the interest rate differential between two countries. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
  - uncovered interest arbitrage / name ::@:: \(__this course__: use _currency carry trade_\) <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-15,24,368-->
  - uncovered interest arbitrage / vs. covered interest arbitrage ::@:: Unlike covered interest arbitrage, uncovered interest arbitrage involves no hedging of foreign exchange risk with the use of forward contracts or any other contract. <p> The strategy involves risk, as an investor exposed to exchange rate fluctuations is speculating that exchange rates will remain favorable enough for arbitrage to be profitable. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-09,18,348-->
  - uncovered interest arbitrage / occurrence ::@:: The opportunity to earn profits arises from the reality that the uncovered interest rate parity condition does not constantly hold—that is, the interest rate on investments in one country's currency does not always equal the interest rate on foreign-currency investments plus the rate of appreciation that is expected for the foreign currency relative to the domestic currency. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
  - uncovered interest arbitrage / intuition ::@:: When a discrepancy between these occurs, investors who are willing to take on risk will not be indifferent between the two possible locations of investment, and will invest in whichever currency is expected to offer a higher rate of return including currency exchange gains or losses \(perhaps adjusted for a risk premium\). <p> In short, borrow in low-rate currencies and lend in high-rate currencies. If $\beta = 0$, you earn _excess return_ from the interest rate differential. If $\beta = 1$, i.e. UIP holds, this excess return is removed. But empirically, $\beta < 1$, meaning the high-rate currencies do not depreciate enough \(or even appreciate if $\beta < 0$\) to remove all _excess return_. You may even earn further excess return from the appreciation when $\beta < 0$. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
- currency future
  - currency future / borrowing analogy ::@:: For the long position, it is like borrowing in the quote currency, converting and investing in the base currency \(the underlying\), and at maturity converting back into the original currency. For the short position, reverse these trades. This helps you to figure out the correct positions in _currency carr trade_. <p> To see this, we replicate a currency future. Borrow $S_0 e^{-r^*T}$ in the quote currency. Convert this into base currency \(the underlying\): $e^{-r^*T}$ and invest risk-free. At time $T$, you have $1$ base currency. Convert this into the quote currency: $S_T$. Repay the loan: $-S_0 e^{(r - r^*) T}$. Your payoff is $S_T - S_0 e^{(r - r^*) T} = S_T - F_{0, T}$, the same payoff as a currency future. And the initial payoff is zero, as in a currency future. <!--SR:!2025-11-01,10,328!2025-11-15,24,368-->
- [carry](../../../../general/carry%20(investment).md) ::@:: The __carry__ of an asset is the return obtained from holding it \(if positive\), or the cost of holding it \(if negative\) \(see also Cost of carry\). <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
  - carry / currency carry trade ::@:: Investors borrow low-yielding currencies and lend \(invest in\) high-yielding currencies. It is thought to correlate with global financial and exchange rate stability and retracts in use during global liquidity shortages, but the carry trade is often blamed for rapid currency value collapse and appreciation. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-09,18,348-->
  - carry / Chinese copper carry trade ::@:: background & motivation → letter of credit \(LC\) → bonded warehouses & copper warrants → profit share → variations → constraints & regulations → effects <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-16,25,368-->
    - carry / Chinese copper carry trade / background & motivation ::@:: Post‑2010 China had a large interest‑rate differential between the domestic yuan (CNY) and U.S. dollars: ~4–5% versus near‑zero USD rates. <p> The Chinese government's capital controls prevented onshore banks from lending dollars to investors, effectively blocking traditional carry‑trade strategies that borrow in USD and invest in high‑yield CNY assets. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,23,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
    - carry / Chinese copper carry trade / letter of credit \(LC\) ::@:: A Chinese importer obtains a bank‑issued LC payable in U.S. dollars, but the payment is deferred (often 6 months). The importer purchases physical copper from overseas. <p> Then, the importer purchases physical copper from overseas sells the copper locally at prevailing market prices, generating proceeds in CNY. These funds are deposited into a high‑yield CNY deposit account (or other CNY‑denominated investment) and held until the LC maturity. <p> At maturity, the importer uses the CNY proceeds to buy USD at the prevailing spot rate to settle the LC. <p> The importer profits if the interest earned on the CNY investment offset by any depreciation \(or appreciation\) of the CNY against USD exceeds the LC cost. <!--SR:!2025-11-05,14,348!2025-11-09,18,348-->
    - carry / Chinese copper carry trade / bonded warehouses & copper warrants ::@:: To overcome the physical limit of copper inventory, an offshore firm issue _warrants_ tied to bonded‑copper stocks. The warrant is a contractual right to deliver copper from the warehouse; it can be transferred without moving the actual metal. The warehouse (e.g., Shanghai Waigaoqiao) remains "offshore" and exempt from customs duties. <p> In the original scheme, the imported copper imported by the onshore firm is sold locally to obtain CNY for investment. In the new scheme, the imported copper _warrant_ is sold to an offshore subsidiary to obtain USD or CNH \(offshore CNY\). This USD or CNH is converted into CNY for investment, and the rest proceeds as above for the onshore firm. For the offshore subsidiary, the USD or CNH is recovered by reselling the warrant back to the warehouse, possibly with a bit of discount for the warrant service. <!--SR:!2025-11-01,10,328!2025-11-16,25,368-->
    - carry / Chinese copper carry trade / profit share ::@:: The offshore firm owning the copper and issuing the warrants is happy: it profits from warrant service fees. The onshore firm is happy: it profits from the carry trade. The domestic bank is also happy, because it earns fees from LC, currency conversion, and wealth management products \(WMPs\). <!--SR:!2025-11-05,14,348!2025-11-15,24,368-->
    - carry / Chinese copper carry trade / variations ::@:: Similar "carry‑trade" schemes were built around high value‑to‑density commodities: gold, nickel, soybeans, palm oil, rubber, zinc, aluminium, etc. <p> Rather than relying solely on "fake" imports backed by letters of credit, some Chinese firms engaged in "phantom" exports: they moved goods in and out of bonded warehouses repeatedly, each movement being recorded as an export. Because domestic banks profited from issuing guarantee letters, handling currency conversions, and providing wealth management products \(WMPs\), they were willing to facilitate these transactions, thereby expanding the scale of the carry‑trade beyond copper alone. <!--SR:!2025-11-05,14,348!2025-11-06,15,348-->
    - carry / Chinese copper carry trade / constraints & regulations ::@:: While the schemes exploit capital‑control loopholes, they remain subject to scrutiny by Chinese regulators \(e.g., foreign exchange authorities\). <p> The scale of trades is limited by paperwork turnaround times, warehouse capacity, and the risk that regulators may clamp down on perceived arbitrage exploitation. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,24,368!2025-11-14,23,368-->
    - carry / Chinese copper carry trade / effects ::@:: Reports suggest that a single tonne of bonded copper could be used in dozens of LC‑based carry trades within a year. <p> The "multiple‑trip" commodity trades were extensive: Shenzhen—particularly its Futian and Shatoujiao bonded areas—was the hub of these operations. In 2013, exports to those zones grew sharply, accounting for 10–16% of all Chinese exports, and rising year‑on‑year at triple‑digit rates. The data also highlight the sheer dollar volume involved: Hong Kong imported about US&nbsp;\$50&nbsp;billion from China in 2013, up from a normal US&nbsp;\$30&nbsp;billion. It underscores that these bonded‑warehouse arbitrage trades were not occasional tricks but large‑scale, high‑value operations centered around Shenzhen's bonded trade areas. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,25,368!2025-11-06,15,348-->
