- [derivative](../../../../general/derivative%20(finance).md) ::@:: It is a contract between a buyer and a seller. The derivative can take various forms, depending on the transaction, but every derivative has the following four elements: ... <!--SR:!2025-12-01,66,310!2025-11-30,65,310-->
  - derivative / elements ::@:: tradeable item, future act, future act price, future act time <!--SR:!2025-11-30,65,310!2025-11-28,63,310-->
    - derivative / elements / tradeable item ::@:: an item \(the "underlier"\) that can or must be bought or sold, e.g. commodity, event, financial asset, intangible good, natural condition index, etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,54,310!2025-11-27,63,310-->
    - derivative / elements / future act ::@:: a future act which must occur \(such as a sale or purchase of the underlier\) <!--SR:!2025-11-21,58,310!2025-11-21,58,310-->
    - derivative / elements / future act price ::@:: a price at which the future transaction must take place <!--SR:!2025-11-20,57,310!2025-11-29,64,310-->
    - derivative / elements / future act time ::@:: a future date by which the act \(such as a purchase or sale\) must take place <!--SR:!2025-11-18,55,310!2025-11-19,56,310-->
  - derivative / examples ::@:: exotic option, forward/future, option, etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-26,62,310!2025-11-18,55,310-->
- [economics](../../../../general/economics.md) ::@:: It is a behavioral science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. <!--SR:!2025-11-19,56,310!2025-11-22,58,310-->
  - economics / objectives ::@:: Maximize _utility_, subject to _constraints_. Constraints are important because people have _limited_ resources. <!--SR:!2025-11-24,60,310!2025-11-27,63,310-->
  - economics / finance ::@:: a subfield of economics <p> _utility_: _expected_ return <br/> _constraint_: _affordable_ risk <!--SR:!2025-11-20,57,310!2025-11-22,58,310-->
    - economics / finance / risk ::@:: It is important because we assume people are _risk-averse_. <!--SR:!2025-11-25,61,310!2025-11-29,64,310-->
- derivative
  - derivative / usage ::@:: There are many usage. A major one is to hedge or to mitigate risk in the underlying, by entering into a derivative contract whose value moves in the opposite direction to their underlying position and cancels part or all of it out. <p> You may prefer some types of risk while disliking other types of risk. Derivatives are _convenient_, _flexible_, and _low cost_ enough to hedge those unwanted risks. <!--SR:!2025-11-24,60,310!2025-11-03,43,290-->
  - derivative / examples
    - derivative / examples / currency future ::@:: I want to use today's exchange rate for a conversion in the future. If you think the target currency will rise in value \(the current currency will depreciate\), then you take a _long position_ in a the target currency's future. Otherwise, you take a _short position_. <p> The _exchange rate risk_ is eliminated, including the case in which the target currency moves in the opposite direction as you expected \(you would have earned more if you had not started a future\). One major risk is _counterparty risk_, in which the counterparty does not perform the future act. <!--SR:!2025-11-12,47,290!2026-01-05,79,270-->
    - derivative / examples / put option ::@:: I want to lock-in the capital gains now but realize them in the future \(e.g. for _tax purposes_\), buy an _at-the-money_ put option to sell the shares at the current price in the future, in case the price falls. <p> One major risk is _loss of the premium_ paid to buy the option. Some specific _risks_ for tax purposes is _risk of fluctuating tax rates_. <!--SR:!2026-02-03,108,290!2025-11-01,41,290-->
    - derivative / examples / variance swap ::@:: You are a portfolio manager evaluated based on _tracking errors_ on an index. _Market volatility_ is an obstacle to reducing the tracking error. Entering a _variance swap_ on the index pays off when market volatility rises. <!--SR:!2025-10-24,32,270!2025-11-19,56,310-->
    - derivative / examples / "the big short" ::@:: In 2006: An investor \(John Paulson\) cannot short houses, and housing stocks may be costly to short. But the investor can short APX subprime _index_, short _collateralized debt obligations_ \(CDOs\), buy _credit default swaps_, etc. <p> Derivatives allow the investor to _circumvent_ market restrictions and _speculate_. <!--SR:!2025-11-10,46,290!2025-11-23,59,310-->
    - derivative / examples / call option ::@:: A CEO is compensated with firm shares that cannot be easily sold to motivate the CEO. But this may make the CEO not take profitable but _risky_ projects. Adding _call options_ to the firm shares allow the CEO to _earn more_ if a risky project succeeds, and _lose less_ if it fails. <!--SR:!2025-11-28,63,310!2025-11-23,59,310-->
  - derivative / returns relation ::@:: Investing in a stock \(_long position_\) is assumed to have _linear_ returns. Shorting a stock \(_short position_\) is assumed to also have linear returns but in the _opposite direction_ \(negate the slope\). <p> Derivatives generally have _nonlinear_ returns. This may allow better matching to _risk aversion_, which models the utility function as nonlinear. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,54,310!2025-11-13,48,290-->
  - derivative / history ::@:: Even in ancient times \(e.g. BC\), people already have this concept... <!--SR:!2025-12-02,67,310!2025-11-25,61,310-->
  - derivative / popularity ::@:: Most sectors use derivatives, forex \(foreign exchange\), and interest rate. Only some sectors use commodity, credit, and equity. <!--SR:!2025-12-01,66,310!2025-12-02,67,310-->

  - exchange-traded derivative contract / standardization ::@:: They are standardized and require payment of an initial deposit or margin settled through a clearing house. Since the contracts are standardized, accurate pricing models are often available. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-11-24,50,324-->
  - exchange-traded derivative contract / advantages ::@:: liquid, minimal counterparty risk, standardized, transparent <!--SR:!2026-01-01,82,344!2025-12-24,75,344-->
  - exchange-traded derivative contract / examples ::@:: futures, options \(on futures and stocks\) <!--SR:!2026-01-01,82,344!2025-12-26,77,344-->
- [clearing house](../../../../general/clearing%20house%20(finance).md) ::@:: It is a financial institution formed to facilitate the exchange \(i.e., _clearance_\) of payments, securities, or derivatives transactions. The clearing house stands between two clearing firms \(also known as member firms or participants\). <!--SR:!2025-12-24,75,344!2025-12-24,75,344-->
- [over-the-counter](../../../../general/over-the-counter%20(finance).md) \(OTC\) ::@:: It is done directly between two parties, without the supervision of an exchange. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via exchanges. <p> In an OTC trade, the price is not necessarily publicly disclosed. <!--SR:!2025-12-26,77,344!2025-12-26,77,344-->
  - over-the-counter / characteristics ::@:: customized contracts, exotic contracts, mediated by dealers, not a place <!--SR:!2025-11-30,55,324!2025-12-22,73,344-->
  - over-the-counter / disadvantages ::@:: counterparty risk, less liquid, opaque, systemic risk \(if major dealers are distressed\) <!--SR:!2026-01-02,83,344!2025-12-28,78,344-->
  - over-the-counter / examples ::@:: exotic options, forwards, structured products, swaps <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-12-27,78,344-->
- exchange-traded derivative contract
  - exchange-traded derivative contract / popularity ::@:: Much less popular than over-the-counter derivatives. Their notational value has rarely exceeded the world GDP \(about \$100 trillion\). <!--SR:!2025-12-27,78,344!2025-12-01,56,324-->
- over-the-counter
  - over-the-counter / derivative popularity :: Much more popular than exchange-traded derivatives. Their notational value is several times the world GDP \(about \$100 trillion\).
- derivative
  - derivative / makeup ::@:: \(most popular\) interest rate \(almost 80%\) &gt; foreign exchange \(almost 20%\) &gt; equity &gt; credit &gt; commodities \(least popular\) <!--SR:!2025-11-16,41,304!2025-11-15,40,304-->
  - derivative / popularity ::@:: It has become very popular since the Cobe Global Markets opened in 1973, especially after 2000 and even more so after 2020. <!--SR:!2025-12-31,81,344!2025-12-24,75,344-->
  - derivative / brief history ::@:: We started with somewhat normal derivatives, e.g. equity options, forex futures, swaps, etec.; and they have gotten more weird over time, e.g. catastrophe options, credit derivatives, energy derivatives, exotic options, weather derivatives, etc. <p> Maybe in the future we will get derivatives on climate, liquidity, political risk, or even other derivatives... <!--SR:!2025-12-25,76,344!2025-12-24,75,344-->
  - derivative / risks ::@:: counterparty risk, hidden tail risk, leverage, etc. <!--SR:!2025-12-29,79,344!2025-12-22,73,344-->
    - derivative / risks / disasters ::@:: It has led to many disasters, causing loss in the millions or billions \(in USD dollars\). <p> Warren Buffett referred to derivatives \(specifically, credit default swaps \(CDS\)\) in his famous 2002 speech in which he warned against "financial weapons of mass destruction". <!--SR:!2025-12-27,77,344!2025-12-30,80,344-->
- [financial engineering](../../../../general/financial%20engineering.md) ::@:: It is a multidisciplinary field involving financial theory, methods of engineering, tools of mathematics and the practice of programming. It has also been defined as the application of technical methods, especially from mathematical finance and computational finance, in the practice of finance. <!--SR:!2025-12-02,57,324!2025-12-22,73,344-->
  - financial engineering / criticisms ::@:: It can lead to disasters, e.g. 1978 stock market crash \(portfolio insurance\), 2007–09 global financial crisis due \(collateralized debt obligation, credit derivatives\). <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-12-22,73,344-->
- derivative
  - derivative / brief history
    - derivative / brief history / dislikes ::@:: There is a long tradition of disliking derivatives, going as far back as the medieval times. <p> A notable one is the Hatch and Washburn Anti-Option Bill in 1892, which would had banned futures and options trading. It passed both Houses of Congress but failed on technicalities. <!--SR:!2025-12-28,78,344!2025-12-31,81,344-->
- [questions § derivative definition](questions.md#derivative%20definition)
- [spot market](../../../../general/spot%20market.md) ::@:: It is a public financial market in which financial instruments or commodities are traded for immediate delivery. It contrasts with a futures market, in which delivery is due at a later date. <!--SR:!2025-11-24,50,324!2026-01-02,83,344-->
  - spot market / steps ::@:: These 3 steps happen \(almost\) _simultaneously_ in a _outright purchase_: Set the price \(also called _spot price_\). Transfer cash from the buyer to the seller. Transfer asset from the seller to the buyer. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-12-27,77,344-->
  - spot market / convention ::@:: In a spot market, settlement normally happens in T+2 working days, i.e., delivery of cash and commodity must be done after two working days of the trade date. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,76,344!2025-12-28,78,344-->
- [forward contract](../../../../general/forward%20contract.md) ::@:: It is a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed on in the contract, making it a type of derivative instrument. <!--SR:!2025-12-24,75,344!2025-12-27,78,344-->
  - forward contract / convention ::@:: It usually _costs nothing_ to enter. Ultimately, this is subject to agreement between the two parties. <!--SR:!2025-12-28,79,344!2025-12-02,57,324-->
  - forward contract / values ::@:: forward, maturity value, notational value, return, etc. <!--SR:!2025-12-29,79,344!2025-12-22,73,344-->
    - forward contract / values / forward price ::@:: The forward price is set such that the _value_ of the forward equals zero for both parties at the start. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-12-26,77,344-->
    - forward contract / values / maturity date ::@:: The time the purchase or sale occurs. <!--SR:!2026-01-01,82,344!2025-12-23,74,344-->
    - forward contract / values / notational value ::@:: The spot price of the underlying item _now_. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-12-25,76,344-->
  - forward contract / market ::@:: It is traded on OTC markets as they are non-standardized. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,74,344!2025-12-28,79,344-->
  - forward contract / positions ::@:: long position: Buyer of the underlying item, as it expects its spot price to rise. <br/> short position: Seller of the underlying item, as it expects its spot price to decline. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,76,344!2025-12-25,76,344-->
  - forward contract / payoffs ::@:: The value of a forward position _at maturity_ depends on the relationship between the delivery price \($K$\) and the underlying price \($S_{T}$\) at that time. <p> - For a long position this payoff is: $f_{T}=S_{T}-K$ <br/> - For a short position, it is: $f_{T}=K-S_{T}$ <p> The payoffs for the two positions always sum to zero, making this a _zero-sum_ game. <!--SR:!2026-01-02,83,344!2025-12-31,81,344-->
    - forward contract / payoffs / interpretation ::@:: Since the final value \(at maturity\) of a forward position depends on the spot price which will then be prevailing, this contract can be viewed, from a purely financial point of view, as _"a bet on the future spot price"_. <!--SR:!2025-12-24,75,344!2025-12-22,73,344-->
  - forward contract / usage ::@:: short selling, synthetic zero-coupon bond, etc. <!--SR:!2025-12-30,80,344!2025-12-27,78,344-->
    - forward contract / usage / short selling ::@:: You want to short a stock to earn money because you expect its price will drop. Normally, you borrow the stock and sell it. Later, when the price declines, you buy the stock and repay. But this may not always be possible, perhaps due to borrowing, cost, regulations, etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,40,304!2025-11-24,50,324-->
      - forward contract / usage / short selling / solution ::@:: You can instead short a forward contract with the stock as the underlying item. The forward price should be the current stock price \(assuming no dividends\). Start a forward contract and short it. When it matures, you buy the stock and sell it at the forward price \(or use some other settlement methods, e.g. cash settlement\). <p> If the stock price has fallen, you earn from the resale, and vice versa. <!--SR:!2025-12-02,57,324!2025-12-31,81,344-->
  - forward contract / values
    - forward contract / values / return ::@:: It does not make sense to calculate return if it costs nothing to enter a forward contract. The denominator would have been zero. <p> However, sometimes you need to put up cash as _collateral_. The collateral could have been invested elsewhere. So it is the \(opportunity\) cost of the forward contract. As the collateral can be much smaller than the forward price, this is one way to _leverage_ your return \(both gain and loss\). <!--SR:!2025-12-25,76,344!2025-12-25,76,344-->
  - forward contract / usage
    - forward contract / usage / synthetic zero-coupon bond ::@:: You own some stocks. Your gains and losses are highly dependant on the stock performance. Now you want to replace them with much less volatile bonds. For simplicity, the bonds are zero-coupon bonds. <p> However, selling the stocks and then buying the bonds may be expensive \(transaction costs, etc.\) or impossible \(liquidation issues, no matching bonds, etc.\). <!--SR:!2025-11-23,49,324!2025-12-29,79,344-->
      - forward contract / usage / synthetic zero-coupon bond / solution ::@:: You can instead short a forward contract with the stock as the underlying item. The forward price should be the same as the final payment of the corresponding zero-coupon bond, calculated using the interest rate. When it matures, you sell the stock at the forward price. <p> No matter how the stock price has moved, you always receive the forward price at maturity. _Effectively_, combining the stock and the forward contract, you have a zero-coupon bond. It is _"synthetic"_ because you combine the _payoffs_ of two different financial instruments to get a payoff equivalent to a zero-coupon bond. <!--SR:!2025-12-22,73,344!2025-11-11,37,304-->
- [interest](../../../../general/interest.md) ::@:: It is payment from a debtor or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum \(that is, the amount borrowed\), at a particular rate. <!--SR:!2025-11-23,49,324!2025-12-23,74,344-->
  - interest / simple interest ::@:: It is calculated only on the principal amount, or on that portion of the principal amount that remains. It excludes the effect of compounding. <!--SR:!2025-12-01,56,324!2026-01-02,83,344-->
    - interest / simple interest / formula ::@:: Simple interest is calculated according to the following formula: $${\frac {r\cdot B\cdot m}{n} }$$ where <p> - _r_ is the simple annual [interest rate](../../../../general/interest%20rate.md) <br/> - _B_ is the initial balance <br/> - _m_ is the number of time periods elapsed and <br/> - _n_ is the frequency of applying interest. <!--SR:!2025-12-24,75,344!2025-12-30,80,344-->
- [compound interest](../../../../general/compound%20interest.md) ::@:: It is interest accumulated from a principal sum and previously accumulated interest. It is the result of reinvesting or retaining interest that would otherwise be paid out, or of the accumulation of debts from a borrower. <!--SR:!2025-12-28,79,344!2026-01-01,82,344-->
  - compound interest / continuous compounding ::@:: When the number of compounding periods per year increases without limit, continuous compounding occurs, in which case the effective annual rate approaches an upper limit of _e_<sup>_r_</sup> − 1. Continuous compounding can be regarded as letting the compounding period become infinitesimally small, achieved by taking the [limit](../../../../general/limit%20(mathematics).md) as _n_ goes to [infinity](../../../../general/infinity.md). <!--SR:!2025-12-25,76,344!2025-12-22,73,344-->
    - compound interest / continuous compounding / formula ::@:: The amount after _t_ periods of continuous compounding can be expressed in terms of the initial amount _P_<sub>0</sub> as: $$P(t)=P_{0}e^{rt}.$$ Or, finding the interest rate $r$: $$r = \frac 1 t \ln \left(\frac {P_t} {P_0}\right) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-12-30,80,344!2025-12-22,73,344-->
