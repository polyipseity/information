__Forwards__ and __forwards__ are contracts to exchange an asset at a specified price and time in the future. They are a type of _derivatives_, which are financial contracts whose payoff depends on another security or underlying asset; they are also known as _contingent claims_. Their cash flows differ from those of ordinary stocks and bonds, and their prices arise through payoff replication and non‑arbitrage arguments.

They may be extended by _options_, which are instruments granting the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) an asset at a predetermined strike price.

## Long-Term Capital Management example

_Long‑Term Capital Management_ (LTCM) was founded in early 1994 with a minimum investment of $\$10\text{ million}$. Its founders included prominent bond traders and two Nobel laureates. The firm initially concentrated on global bond arbitrages before expanding into equity arbitrage trades. LTCM’s core idea was to exploit small, persistent mispricings between related assets using sophisticated statistical models.

## strategy of LTCM

LTCM pursued _relative‑value_ arbitrages: it sought pairs of highly correlated instruments (e.g., two government bonds) whose price spread deviated from its historical norm. When a _rational explanation_ can be given why they should converge, by buying the underpriced asset and selling the overpriced one, LTCM expected the spread to converge. Because correlations are difficult to estimate accurately, to ensure low correlations across _different_ pairs of instruments, the firm relied on a large, market‑neutral portfolio that could profit in both up‑and‑down markets.

To conserve equity and amplify returns it used extreme leverage: most trades were financed through repos or reverse repos with six‑to‑twelve‑month maturities. A bond was posted as collateral for a loan; the proceeds bought another bond and secured further borrowing, creating a chain of rehypothecated collateral—what is often called _hyper‑leverage_. LTCM also held thousands of over‑the‑counter total‑return swaps, with notional values exceeding $\$1\text{ trillion}$. Its equity base was roughly $\$5\text{ billion}$, while borrowing could exceed $\$100\text{ billion}$, but it being secretive meant the market could not easily figure out that they were hyper-leveraged.

## risk factors of LTCM

The firm’s profitability hinged on the assumption that yield spreads among global bonds would narrow. In 1997–1998, however, a series of exogenous shocks—such as the Asian crisis, the Russian default, and political turmoil in Indonesia—caused spreads to widen sharply. Mark‑to‑market losses rose, and volatility surged. Additionally, many other hedge funds copied LTCM’s strategies; when distress began, all funds hurried to unwind similar positions simultaneously. This led to a loss of diversification: the portfolio became highly correlated with market movements, amplifying losses.

Feedback effects further threatened LTCM's creditworthiness, financing, and clearing arrangements. For example, counterparties could not see LTCM’s full exposure because each leg of a trade was often held by different banks, obscuring the true hedging relationship and causing counterparties to overestimate risk when LTCM were in trouble.

## collapse and aftermath of LTCM

As liquidity dried up, major lenders who had been willing to provide credit found themselves in a precarious position. Some major lenders took advantage of LTCM's distressed condition. Rumours that LTCM might file for bankruptcy protection in the Cayman Islands caused counterparties to be unsure of their rights under Cayman law, further reducing their willingness to deal with LTCM.

On 23 September 1998, Goldman Sachs, AIG, and Berkshire Hathaway offered \$250 million for LTCM’s partners, a figure far below the firm’s earlier valuation of $\$4.7\text{ billion}$. The offer was rejected. With no further capital, LTCM faced insolvency. To prevent a systemic collapse, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout worth \$3.625 billion, financed by the fund’s principal creditors. In return, LTCM’s partners received a ten‑percent equity stake valued at about \$400 million.
