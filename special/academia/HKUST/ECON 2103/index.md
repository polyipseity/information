- course logistics
  - course intended learning outcomes (CILOs) ::@:: microeconomic analysis, decision making, demand-supply framework, market mechanism in different market structures, economic effect of the government, application <!--SR:!2025-11-15,320,332!2025-03-22,124,292-->
  - objectives ::@:: to analyze situations through the lens of microeconomics, but not memorization (Of course, some is still required...); a "way of economic thinking" should be developed on your own at the end <!--SR:!2025-08-25,251,330!2025-08-15,228,312-->
- strength and weaknesses of economics ::@:: It can explain how rational individuals make choice under constraints. But it cannot explain well how a group of people (the society) evolve over a long period time; instead, these are studied by history, psychology, sociology, etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-20,313,310!2025-07-15,206,312-->
- quirks about the professor ::@:: He does not follow the textbook strictly to deepen your thinking (good), makes exam questions based on current issues (cool), and does not care about attendance (good). <!--SR:!2025-08-17,247,332!2025-09-20,260,330-->

  - assigned reading: textbook chapter 1, textbook chapter 2
  - assignment: [problem set 1](assignments/problem%20set%201/submission.md)
- way of economic thinking ::@:: Analyze people's choice under constraints. We assume that people maximize the utility (e.g. happiness) of their choice. We also assume that people have constraints (e.g. budget), or otherwise there is no need to make choices — just choose everything! <!--SR:!2025-11-16,321,332!2025-11-02,313,350-->
  - way of economic thinking / motivation ::@:: We receive much information from the world everyday, then we interpret it and make predictions based on it. Different people interprets and predicts differently. Whoever make the best prediction based on their interpretation will be the winners. The "way of economic thinking" can help with making better interpretations and hence predictions. <!--SR:!2025-06-24,189,312!2025-06-26,191,312-->
- 10 principles of economics ::@:: These are some fundamentals principles of economics. Okay, these 10 principles is more of a pedagogical (teaching) tool to introduce us to economics... <!--SR:!2025-09-08,265,332!2025-12-21,351,350-->
  - 10 principles of economics / (1) scarcity (people face trade-offs) ::@:: Why do people face trade-offs? Because people are short of "something"! Thinking about how to spend your time? You are short of time. Why do you need to pay for "something"? Because there is not enough of "something" to satisfy everyone. This is known as __scarcity__, which depends on _both_ "availability" (supply) and "want" (demand). <!--SR:!2025-04-07,138,312!2025-06-22,187,312-->

      - [§ nonscarce goods](../../../../general/scarcity.md#nonscarce%20goods)
  - 10 principles of economics / (2) opportunity cost (choices and opportunity cost) ::@:: __Opportunity cost__ is the "cost" we usually talk about in economics. Unless otherwise specified or inferred, the word "cost" refers to _opportunity cost_. It is the the value of the best alternative forgone (this includes the _explicit cost_ of the selected choice), given that you have to make a choice. There is __explicit opportunity cost__, which is opportunity cost that requires either a cash transaction or a physical transfer of resources, and thus is easily identifiable. But there is also __implicit opportunity cost__, which is opportunity cost that involves neither a cash transaction nor a physical transfer of resources. <!--SR:!2025-08-05,224,330!2025-07-26,214,312-->
    - 10 principles of economics / opportunity cost / definitions ::@:: Opportunity cost may _rarely_ only refer to _implicit opportunity cost_. In that case, __economic cost__ is sometimes used to refer the _sum_ of explicit (also called __accounting cost__) and implicit opportunity cost. In this course, __opportunity cost__ includes _both_ explicit and implicit opportunity cost. <!--SR:!2025-06-10,192,330!2025-06-15,180,310-->
    - 10 principles of economics / opportunity cost / choice ::@:: If there is no choice to be made, either because there is _one and only one available option_ (e.g. food, sleep; which you cannot decide to NOT do) or _all options can be chosen_ (e.g. you can buy everything you want if you are a billionaire), then there is _no opportunity cost_. Opportunity cost can change as new choices (information) become available (e.g. suddenly finding gold/oil under your business's hotel). <!--SR:!2025-06-06,175,312!2025-06-07,189,330-->
    - 10 principles of economics / opportunity cost / reason for including the _explicit opportunity cost_ ::@:: This is a frequent point of confusion. It would seem like the _explicit opportunity cost_ should be not included because it is _usually_ a direct cost of the choice being made and should not belong to the value of the _best alternative forgone_. However, if you consider that the direct cost of the current choice itself also have _alternative uses_, then it is clear why the direct cost should also be included. <!--SR:!2025-06-07,176,312!2025-11-04,315,350-->
    - 10 principles of economics / opportunity cost / sunk cost ::@:: Opportunity cost is a _forward-looking_ concept, because _previously incurred and irreversible_ costs should be ignored when making decisions _now_. This cost is known as __sunk cost__. Why should we ignore it when making decisions? This is because no matter what decision you make right now, it will not affect sunk costs. Hence the name "_sunk_ cost". <!--SR:!2025-06-27,202,312!2025-05-18,179,330-->

      - [§ sunk costs](../../../../general/opportunity%20cost.md#sunk%20costs)
  - 10 principles of economics / (3) marginalism (rational people think at the margin) ::@:: Is human rational? What is rationality? You could "explain" rationality by saying some behaviors are rational and others are irrational, but this is rather arbitrary. A less _ad hoc_ way to explain rationality is using _principles_. Economists use the principle of __marginalism__. <!--SR:!2025-07-16,207,312!2025-06-29,204,312-->
    - 10 principles of economics / marginalism / assumptions ::@:: Economists _usually_ assume people are perfectly rational and have complete information. Incomplete information _may_ make perfectly rational people appear irrational, even though the perfectly rational people are making the most rational choice given that information is incomplete. And in real life, people are _not_ perfectly rational, but we can still research them by borrowing tools on human behaviors from _psychology_, relaxing the assumption of perfect rationality. <!--SR:!2025-04-17,138,310!2025-08-17,247,332-->
    - 10 principles of economics / marginalism / details ::@:: __Marginal unit__ is an additional unit, e.g. products, goods, etc. __Marginal benefit__ refers to the benefit of having an extra unit, and __marginal cost__ refers to the cost of having an extra unit, both given that you have a certain amount of something. Usually, the marginal benefit decreases as you have more of that something, known as the __law of diminishing marginal utility__. Perfectly rational people will keep getting extra units until the marginal benefit decreases enough to equate to the marginal cost. <!--SR:!2025-11-05,316,350!2025-10-15,298,350-->

- 10 principles of economics
  - 10 principles of economics / (4) incentive (people respond to incentives) ::@:: People are not machines and you (usually :/) cannot just order people to do something. However, you can use __incentives__ to guide people's behaviors _significantly_. Incentives lead to intended consequences, but may also lead to __unintended consequences__, because people react to incentives _smartly_ (for perfectly rational people, this is maximizing their benefits given the incentives). <!--SR:!2025-07-11,202,312!2025-10-16,296,330-->
    - 10 principles of economics / incentive / rent regulation ::@:: Can rent regulation protect poor people from rent increase? Maybe... but also maybe not. Landlords may decide to not rent, spend less money on maintaining the rental units, etc. This is an example of _unintended consequences_. Indeed, the consensus of many economists is that rent regulation reduces the quantity and quality of rental units. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,111,292!2025-11-05,316,350-->
  - 10 principles of economics / (5) trade ::@:: It can make everyone better off. This will be explained in chapter 3. (Or see _comparative advantage_...) <!--SR:!2025-02-21,109,310!2025-11-16,321,332-->
    - [opportunity cost § comparative advantage versus absolute advantage](../../../../general/opportunity%20cost.md#comparative%20advantage%20versus%20absolute%20advantage)
  - 10 principles of economics / (6) market economy ::@:: __Markets__ (__market economy__) are _usually_ a good way, in terms of efficiency to the society, to organize economic activities. Under __perfect competition__, this is true. However, in real life situations where perfect competition may not hold, markets may fail to be most efficient for the society, and this is known as __market failure__. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,200,312!2025-07-27,215,312-->

  - assignment: [problem set 2](assignments/problem%20set%202/submission.md)
- [correlation](../../../../general/correlation.md) ::@:: Two things appear (more likely than expected) at the same time, i.e. you can see A and B happening together. <!--SR:!2025-09-07,264,332!2025-07-29,217,312-->
  - [§ correlation](../../../../general/correlation.md#correlation)
- [causality](../../../../general/causality.md) ::@:: A causes B. A must happen before B in time. Correlation is not necessarily causation. We also need the additional two requirements of keeping everything else the same, and A happens before B, to conclude a correlation is also a causation. <!--SR:!2025-04-13,134,310!2025-12-17,348,350-->
  - [§ causality](../../../../general/causality.md#causality)
- omitted variable ::@:: They are variables that exist but not considered in your causation analysis. Assume A correlates with B, and B causes C. Omitting B may lead us to erroneously assume that A causes C. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,141,312!2025-09-29,282,332-->
- reverse causality ::@:: Assume A causes B. You observe that A correlates with B. You may erroneously conclude that B causes A. This is because regardless if A causes B or B causes A, A correlates with B.  So it is not possible to distinguish between A causes B and B causes A, given we only know that A correlates with B. Extra information is needed to do so. <!--SR:!2025-09-28,281,332!2025-12-19,349,350-->
- scientific method ::@:: observe, explain using a (simplified) model, test by real-world observations <!--SR:!2025-07-10,201,312!2025-09-21,260,330-->
  - scientific method / economics ::@:: It is rare to do _control experiments_ because the conditions are almost impossible to be set like those in the model. <!--SR:!2025-10-20,300,332!2025-11-03,314,350-->
  - scientific method / economic models (examples) ::@:: circular-flow model, production possibilities frontier <!--SR:!2025-07-18,219,312!2025-09-12,269,332-->
  - scientific method / models ::@:: Models usually have many assumptions to keep it simple. The assumptions can be almost real, or completely out-of-reality. However, the usefulness of a model depends on its explanatory and predictive power. <!--SR:!2025-10-20,300,332!2025-07-12,203,312-->
- [positive and normative economics](../../../../general/positive%20and%20normative%20economics.md) ::@:: Positive: What is? We simply describe economics as-is. These statements are testable. Normative: What should be? We apply our own value judgement, which may differ from individuals to individuals. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,198,312!2025-08-04,223,330-->
  - Why do economists disagree with each other? ::@:: Economists can disagree with each other! \*grasp\* This could be a difference of scientific judgement, such as different economics schools of thought. The schools of thought predict different things with different theories, and it is difficult to create natural experiments to test them and see which are better. Another source is value judgement, such as the ultimate goal of studying economics. <!--SR:!2025-03-01,101,292!2025-07-08,199,312-->

  - assignment: [problem set 3](assignments/problem%20set%203/submission.md)
- exchange ::@:: It is transferring things with economic value to others, with said others giving back other things with economic value, usually money. <!--SR:!2025-08-24,250,330!2025-07-10,201,312-->
  - exchange / When? ::@:: The first scenario is maybe we have the same item, but said item has different economic values to us. Or I have more of the item so its marginal utility to me is low due to the law of diminishing marginal utility. The second scenario is we produce different items, and we produce our own item at a lower cost (= opportunity cost) than anyone can. The second one is more significant. In both cases, both parties benefit from exchange. In the latter case, it also leads to specialization of production. <!--SR:!2025-08-20,233,312!2025-02-16,106,310-->
- [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) ::@:: labor, capital, land, and entrepreneur/enterprise <!--SR:!2025-12-24,355,350!2025-09-11,268,332-->
  - [§ factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md#factors%20of%20production)
  - [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) / substitution ::@:: The factors of production may be able to substitute each other. For example, if a work can be done by either labor or machine, then labor and capital substitutes each other. <!--SR:!2025-01-28,89,290!2025-08-23,249,330-->
  - [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) / labor :@: Labor does not refer to _person_, but rather _effort_. Many people, but none working at all, contributes no labor. Thus, incentives to work are also important, such as institution and compensation systems. Additionally, machinery or tools can improve labor productivity (amount of production per person). Developed countries usually have good incentive systems and many machinery and tools, which can be measured by capital per capita. <!--SR:!2025-08-06,225,330-->
  - [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) / entrepreneur ::@:: It refers to how the other three factors are combined by entrepreneurs by make a profit. It distinguishes _labor effort_ and _risk-taking behavior_. <!--SR:!2025-06-21,186,312!2025-09-30,283,332-->
  - [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) / land ::@:: Land not only includes the site of production but also its natural resources. Land is mostly created by nature, but nowadays can be changed _slightly_ by humans. <!--SR:!2025-10-20,300,332!2025-03-02,102,292-->
  - [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) / capital ::@:: __Capital creation__ is interesting. We can invest capital to get more capital back in the future. This is known as a __trade-off__ of current and future consumption. <!--SR:!2025-07-14,205,312!2025-10-03,286,332-->
  - [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) / examples ::@:: For example, a fisherman buying (has (opportunity) cost, sacrificing current consumption) a fish net (__investment__) to better catch fish (__return to capital__) is a trade-off. The fisherman is using his/her _capital_. Also, note that the fisherman is providing _labor_ himself/herself. Finally, also note that the fisherman also has _entrepreneurship_, because he/she needs to bear the risk of not recovering all the cost of his/her initial investment (_risk-taking behavior_). The _land_ is the location he/she fishes in and provides fish, a natural resource. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,200,312!2025-07-28,216,312-->
- [division of labour](../../../../general/division%20of%20labour.md) ::@:: separation of tasks by different entities, _may_ increase the total output of all entities, benefiting everyone via trade <!--SR:!2025-08-22,252,332!2025-10-05,288,332-->
  - [§ division of labour](../../../../general/division%20of%20labour.md#division%20of%20labour)
- [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) (PPF) ::@:: A graphical representation showing all the possible options of output for two goods that can be produced using all factors of production. It is an awesome tool to visualize the gain from economic specialization. <!--SR:!2025-04-08,129,292!2025-09-12,269,332-->
  - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / model ::@:: It is a good model. A scenario with 2 goods can be described by a diagram, and scenarios with 2 or more goods can be described using mathematical equations. A scenario with one good is not considered because there is no _trade-off_ and does not show how specialization benefits everyone. So the model is good because it can explain how specialization benefits everyone well. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,322,332!2025-03-08,120,292-->
  - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram ::@:: The diagram is a graph between two goods produced. The order does not matter. Graph the resulting curve by evaluating, given that we have limited resources (factors of production) and we produce a certain amount of a good, the maximum amount of the other good that can be produced. <!--SR:!2025-07-11,202,312!2025-09-10,267,332-->
    - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram / interpretation ::@:: The curve border is known as the __frontier__. The area inside the frontier (including the frontier) is feasible given limited resources (factors of production), while outside the frontier (excluding the frontier) is infeasible given limited resources. A _rational_ person would only produce on the frontier as it is _efficient_, because being inside the frontier (excluding the frontier) means there are unused capacity (__production inefficiency__), while being outside the frontier (excluding the frontier) is impossible. The slope (derivative multiplied by -1) at any point represents the producer __marginal rate of transformation__, i.e. how much of one good needs to be given up to produce a certain amount of the other good. This is also the _marginal (opportunity) cost_ of producing one good, given only these two goods can be produced. <!--SR:!2025-10-21,274,292!2025-06-28,175,270-->

It is possible for a producer to have CA in zero or one, but _not_ two goods. The only situation where a producer has CA in zero goods is when the frontier slopes are the same for producers, in which both producers do not have CA in any goods. They are indifferent to trade. <!--SR:!2025-02-17,28,418!2025-02-17,28,418-->

  - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / intuition for [comparative advantage](../../../../general/comparative%20advantage.md) ::@:: Draw two lines representing the two production–possibility frontiers for both producers. For simplicity, make them linear. Then it becomes clear that comparative advantage is a result of the two frontiers having different slopes. <p> Assume both producers producer at the frontier originally. Consider the effect of trading on the two positions on the graph representing the two producers. Trading moves one position (for a producer) towards a certain direction at a certain magnitude, which the movement of the other position (for the other producer) copies but in the opposite direction. When the slope of this direction is in between the two frontier slopes, both positions will be beyond the frontiers. <p> The above shows how trading is beneficial to both producers, and explains why the exchange ratio must be in between two certain ratios for trade to happen. <!--SR:!2025-02-17,28,418!2025-02-16,27,418-->
  - joint [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) (joint PPF) ::@:: The joint PPF represents the total outputs of multiple producers producing multiple goods.

      - joint [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram / constraints ::@:: To graph it as a diagram, we need to add some constraints, or otherwise a 4D diagram is needed. There are three common constraints. Assume A better _fully_ specializes in X and B better _fully_ specializes Y, using comparative advantages to determine the better specialization. <!--SR:!2025-08-15,245,332!2025-05-17,157,292-->
        - joint [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram / constraints / best full specialization ::@:: This constraint is the curve joined by two curves, with one curve being the PPF of B assuming A fully specializes in X, and the other curve being the PPF of A assuming B fully specializes in Y. They should meet at a point, representing A fully specializing in X and B fully specializing in Y, the best scenario. The final curve should also curve outward. <!--SR:!2025-09-20,260,330!2025-08-16,246,332-->
        - joint [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram / constraints / worst full specialization ::@:: This constraint is the curve joined by two curves, with one curve being the PPF of B assuming A fully specializes in Y, and the other curve being the PPF of A assuming B fully specializes in X. They should meet at a point, representing A fully specializing in Y and B fully specializing in X, the worst scenario.

When they are not both linear, this constraint does not make much sense. The constraint is the percentages of actual X produced divided by maximum X produced are the same for both producers. This is also equivalent to the percentages of actual Y produced divided by maximum Y produced are the same for both producers. The resulting curve should be a _straight line_ in between the two curves constrained as above (best and worst full specialization), and meeting the two curves at the two endpoints (x-axis and y-axis). It represents the _joint PPF without specialization_. <!--SR:!2025-07-13,204,312!2025-04-25,153,312-->
      - joint [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram / interpretation ::@:: Assume the PPFs are _linear_ and the three curves constrained as above are drawn. The curved outward curve should be the "best full specialization" curve. The curved inward curve should be the "worst full specialization" curve. The straight line curve in between should be the "unspecialized" curve, meeting the two curves above at the two endpoints (x-axis and y-axis). The outward point on the curved outward curve represents both producers fully specialize in their own best-specialized goods, thus producing the most total output. The two endpoints represent both producers producing one good only. Lastly, the "unspecialized" curve represents the producers not specializing in anything. The area in between the "best full specialization" and "unspecialized" curve is the _gain from specialization_. <!--SR:!2025-09-07,264,332!2025-02-16,90,290-->

- [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md)
  - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / division of total output ::@:: However, note that while specialization _may_ maximize the total output, both parties only benefit from this when the total output can be _divided fairly_ among the two producers. If there is no way to do so, specialization will not happen. One way to divide the total output fairly is _trade_. <!--SR:!2025-04-28,161,312!2025-06-28,203,312-->
  - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / trade ::@:: One simple way to think about trade is the _exchange ratio_. It is very simple actually. If the marginal (opportunity) cost of producing a good is lower than its marginal benefit (from the exchange ratio), then the producer is willing to trade. If this is the case for both producers producing in their own better specialized products, then they will trade with each other. This is how trade can divide the total output fairly. <!--SR:!2025-06-06,175,312!2025-09-09,266,332-->
    - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / trade / exchange ratio ::@:: But how is the ratio determined? This is where supply and demand comes in, which we will learn soon. In a market, the ratio is also known as the _market price_. To conclude, PPF provides information on the supply side, but we also need to know the demand side to known the ratio, i.e. the _price_, if in a market. <!--SR:!2025-08-16,246,332!2025-04-23,151,312-->
  - [production–possibility frontier § shape](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md#shape) ::@:: If the PPF bows outwards, this imply the marginal cost of a good increases as more of that good is produced. A way to see this compare the slopes. As you increase production of the good in the x-axis, the slope becomes increasingly steep, so the marginal (opportunity) cost of said good increases. (There are also other possible shapes.) <!--SR:!2025-07-17,218,312!2025-10-20,300,332-->
    - [production–possibility frontier § shape](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md#shape) / specialization ::@:: Note how joint PPF also bows outwards for the "best full specialization" curve. Perhaps we can then imagine a society where everyone has their own strengths. Then their joint PPF would also bow outwards, and everyone specializing on their own strengths would yield the most total output. (This explanation is a quite not strict though...) <!--SR:!2025-05-21,161,292!2025-06-15,180,310-->
  - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / growth ::@:: With additional resources or better technology (improved efficiency), we can produce more. As a result, the PPF curve would shift outwards. For resources, the PPF curve would shift outwards evenly. But for better technology, it can also shift outwards evenly, but can also shift outwards unevenly if better technology impacts one good more than the other. <!--SR:!2025-11-01,312,350!2025-07-19,207,312-->
  - [§ position](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md#position)
- trade & policy
  - trade & policy / Does free trade benefit everyone? ::@:: Free trade seems to benefit everyone, since the total output increases by specialization. However, in real world, this is much more complicated. Consider workers in different countries. If a country has lower opportunity cost for a good because the good is labor-intensive and said country pays lower wages, then workers of other countries may go out of work. In a way, the workers are competing across countries due to free trade instead of in their own country only. Workers may get lower wages as a result. Yet, since free trade lowers the marginal (opportunity) cost of goods, the workers can buy goods for cheaper. So it is hard to definitively say if the workers benefit from free trade. For an example, compare China and the United States. <!--SR:!2025-09-10,267,332!2025-05-27,178,312-->

  - supply and demand / demand ::@:: It describes how much buyers are willing to buy given a price level. It can also be interpreted as the _maximum_ price buyers are willing to pay (__willingness to pay__, __WTP__) for a marginal unit given the buyers have already bought a certain quantity of units. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,91,378!2025-02-27,93,386-->

    - [marginal utility § law of diminishing marginal utility](../../../../general/marginal%20utility.md#law%20of%20diminishing%20marginal%20utility) ::@:: The marginal utility of a good or service is the utility of its [marginal use](marginal%20use.md). Under the assumption of economic rationality, it is the utility of its least urgent possible use _from_ the best feasible combination of actions in which its use is included. <p> As more of a good or service is provided, the most urgent possible uses are saturated, and the least urgent possible use becomes less urgent, thus its marginal utility decreases, given _other things being equal_. This explains why the demand curve is usually _assumed downward sloping_. <!--SR:!2025-02-15,82,371!2025-03-04,97,382-->
    - [law of demand](../../../../general/law%20of%20demand.md) ::@:: _Other things being equal_, the _quantity demanded_ of a good or service decreases when its _price_ increases, and vice versa. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,92,371!2025-02-12,79,371-->
    - "change in _demand_" vs "change in _quantity demanded_" ::@:: The former describes a shift in the demand curve itself, while the latter describes the effect of a price change, but the demand curve itself remains unshifted. <!--SR:!2025-03-10,102,382!2025-02-23,89,379-->
    - market demand ::@:: It is the sum of all individual demands at a particular price level. We can draw a _market demand schedule_ to describe this. <!--SR:!2025-03-03,96,382!2025-02-11,75,362-->

  - supply and demand / supply ::@:: It describes how much sellers are willing to sell given a price level. It can also be interpreted as the _minimum_ (not _maximum_) price sellers are willing to sell for a marginal unit given the sellers have already sold a certain quantity of units. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,97,382!2025-03-08,100,379-->
    - supply and demand / supply / slope ::@:: The supply curve is _usually assumed upward sloping_ because the marginal cost of producing an additional unit increases as more units are produced. For examples, machinery may run overtime (higher depreciation, maintenance) and workers may need to work overtime. <!--SR:!2025-03-08,100,382!2025-02-18,85,371-->
      - supply and demand / supply / slope / exceptions ::@:: What about "economies of scale"? Doesn't that mean producing more should have lower marginal cost? Does that mean the supply curve can also be flat or downward sloping? <p> The supply curve we are describing right now is the _short-run_ supply curve, which is usually upward sloping. The above usually only applies to the _long-run_ supply curve. <!--SR:!2025-02-21,87,371!2025-01-27,63,351-->
    - [law of supply](../../../../general/law%20of%20supply.md) ::@:: _Other things being equal_, the _quantity supplied_ of a good or service increases when its _price_ increases, and vice versa. <!--SR:!2025-02-12,79,371!2025-03-10,102,379-->

        - monopoly / graph ::@:: Additionally graph a line known as the marginal revenue (MR) curve. Said curve is usually even more downward sloping then the demand curve. The point where the MR curve and the supply curve meets is the market equilibrium in a monopoly, because this brings the maximum profit for a company in monopoly. Said point has a higher price and lower quantity than the market equilibrium in perfect competition. <!--SR:!2025-03-02,95,378!2025-03-07,99,382-->
        - [marginal revenue](../../../../general/marginal%20revenue.md) (MR) ::@:: The derivative of price multiplied by quantity. For monopoly, the curve is more downward sloping than the demand curve. For perfect competition, the curve is a constant horizontal line at the market equilibrium price. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,99,382!2025-02-23,89,379-->
      - [perfect competition](../../../../general/perfect%20competition.md) ::@:: A __perfect market__, also known as an __atomistic market__, is defined by several idealizing conditions, collectively called __perfect competition__, or __atomistic competition__. <p> It is usually used as a benchmark against other market structures for comparison. Perfect competition are _efficient_: They provide both _allocative efficiency_ and _productive efficiency_. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,98,386!2025-02-16,83,370-->
        - [allocative efficiency](../../../../general/allocative%20efficiency.md) ::@:: It is a state of the economy in which production is aligned with the preferences of consumers and producers; in particular, the set of outputs is chosen so as to maximize the social welfare of society. <!--SR:!2025-02-24,90,371!2025-02-17,84,371-->
        - [productive efficiency](../../../../general/productive%20efficiency.md) ::@:: It is a situation in which the economy or an economic system (e.g., bank, hospital, industry, country) operating within the constraints of current industrial technology cannot increase production of one good without sacrificing production of another good. <!--SR:!2025-01-25,61,351!2025-03-06,98,379-->
        - perfect competition / assumptions ::@:: There are many more assumptions, and we state three of them here: homogeneous products, many sellers and buyers, and perfect information (full information). <!--SR:!2025-03-09,101,382!2025-03-03,96,382-->
          - perfect competition / assumptions / homogeneous products ::@:: The products are perfect substitutes for each other. For example, a bottle of Coca-Cola is the same no matter where you buy it. An counterexample is restaurant: Any restaurant can satisfy your hunger needs, but the food they provide are different. <!--SR:!2025-03-04,97,379!2025-03-05,97,382-->
          - perfect competition / assumptions / many sellers and buyers ::@:: If there are many sellers and buyers, each seller and each buyer does not have enough market ("bargaining") power to set prices. If there is only one seller or one buyer, the one individual can set prices. If there are only few sellers or few buyers, they may still collude together to set prices. <!--SR:!2025-02-26,92,382!2025-02-20,86,371-->
          - perfect competition / assumptions / perfect information ::@:: All buyers and sellers know all prices of products and utilities they would get from owning each product. There are no information that only a few buyers or sellers know that would give them a competitive advantage. <!--SR:!2025-01-28,67,351!2025-02-19,85,370-->
        - perfect competition / examples ::@:: There are no real life examples that exactly matches the model. However, some are close, such as electronic markets (e.g. Amazon), which spread information quickly. <!--SR:!2025-03-10,102,382!2025-02-17,84,371-->
        - perfect competition / implications ::@:: All quantity of a good are sold at the same market price. If not, one would do _arbitrage_, where one buys at a lower price from a seller and re-sell to others at a higher price. <p> No buyers are willing to pay a higher price. No sellers can sell higher or need to sell lower. <!--SR:!2025-03-04,97,379!2025-02-12,79,371-->
        - perfect competition / names ::@:: Buyers and sellers in such a market structure are __price takers__. Such a market is also known as __price-taker market__. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,98,386!2025-02-25,91,378-->
        - [market clearing](../../../../general/market%20clearing.md) ::@:: It is the process by which, in an economic market, the supply of whatever is traded is equated to the demand so that there is no excess supply or demand, ensuring that there is neither a surplus nor a shortage. <!--SR:!2025-03-10,102,379!2025-03-07,99,382-->
          - market clearing / price is higher than equilibrium ::@:: There will be excess supply, and inventory builds up. So most sellers would lower price to try to clear its inventory. As a result, market price decreases and approaches the equilibrium. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,91,378!2025-02-28,93,382-->
          - market clearing / price is lower than equilibrium ::@:: There will be excess demand, and buyers may sometimes cannot find products for sale. So buyers are willing to pay more to get the product in shortage. As a result, market price increases and approaches the equilibrium. <!--SR:!2025-02-13,80,371!2025-03-07,99,382-->
- [supply and demand](../../../../general/supply%20and%20demand.md)
  - supply and demand / advantages ::@:: It is a convenient framework to model how market price changes due to demand-side factors and supply-side factors. <!--SR:!2025-03-03,96,382!2025-03-07,99,382-->
  - supply and demand / disadvantages ::@:: It cannot explain how long it takes to reach the market equilibrium. It cannot also explain how the market price will change exactly (the "path") before reaching the equilibrium. <!--SR:!2025-03-08,100,379!2025-02-20,86,371-->
- [price](../../../../general/price.md) ::@:: A price is the (usually not negative) quantity of payment or compensation expected, required, or given by one party to another in return for goods or services. <!--SR:!2025-02-14,81,371!2025-03-06,98,382-->
  - price / use ::@:: Its main use is for the allocation of scarce resources. Whoever _pays the highest_ can get the scarce resources. And the price determines _what_ and _how much_ to produce for different scarce resources. <p> It organizes production activities in a _decentralized_ way. Self-interests of individuals and firms drive the price. <!--SR:!2025-02-20,86,371!2025-02-15,82,371-->
  - price / planned economy ::@:: For comparison, in a planned economy, allocation of scarce resources is done by the government only. For example, China before economic reform (1979) was mainly a planned economy. <!--SR:!2025-02-23,89,379!2025-02-13,80,371-->

- [price elasticity of demand](../../../../general/price%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md)
  - price elasticity of demand / factors ::@:: In general, the easier a consumer can "escape" from consuming a good, the higher the price elasticity of demand. Four major factors are: broadness of definition, substitution effect, time frame, and type of goods. <!--SR:!2025-02-23,89,378!2025-03-01,94,371-->
    - price elasticity of demand / factors / substitution effect ::@:: If a good is easily substituted by other goods, its elasticity is higher, and vice versa. <!--SR:!2025-02-16,83,371!2025-03-05,97,379-->
      - [substitution effect](../../../../general/substitution%20effect.md)
    - price elasticity of demand / factors / type of goods ::@:: If a good is _luxurious_, its elasticity is higher. If a good is _necessary_, its elasticity is lower. <p> An example is even if water price is high, you will still try to buy (almost) as much water. <!--SR:!2025-02-05,74,362!2025-02-16,83,370-->
      - [luxury goods](../../../../general/luxury%20goods.md) ::@:: A good for which demand increases more than what is proportional as income rises, so that expenditures on the good become a more significant proportion of overall spending. <!--SR:!2025-03-08,100,382!2025-02-18,85,371-->
      - [necessity good](../../../../general/necessity%20good.md) ::@:: A good for which demand increases less than what is proportional as income rises, so that expenditures on the good become a less significant proportion of overall spending. <!--SR:!2025-03-11,103,386!2025-03-11,103,386-->
      - [goods § types of goods](../../../../general/goods.md#types%20of%20goods)
    - price elasticity of demand / factors / broadness of definition ::@:: If you define your goods broadly (e.g. soft drinks), then elasticity is lower, and vice versa (e.g. Coca-Cola). <p> An extreme example to bring the point is that if you define your goods to be "all goods in existence", then a consumer can never "escape" from consuming said goods by definition. <!--SR:!2025-02-23,89,371!2025-03-05,98,386-->
    - price elasticity of demand / factors / time frame ::@:: The longer the time frame we are considering, the higher the elasticity, and vice versa. <p> An example is car fuel. If the price of car fuel rises, in the short run, you will likely just accept it, but in the long run, you may be thinking of eventually switching to an electric car. <!--SR:!2025-01-24,60,350!2025-03-10,102,379-->
      - [long run and short run](../../../../general/long%20run%20and%20short%20run.md)
  - price elasticity of demand / sign ::@:: It is usually negative. However, positive elasticity is possible for Giffen goods... <!--SR:!2025-02-24,90,371!2025-03-07,99,382-->
    - [Giffen good](../../../../general/Giffen%20good.md) ::@:: It is a product that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa, violating the law of demand. <!--SR:!2025-02-21,87,371!2025-02-27,93,386-->
  - price elasticity of demand / graph ::@:: How to see if the price elasticity of demand is elastic or inelastic on a point on the demand curve? <p> Ensure the graph corner is (0, 0) and the graph is not truncated. Draw a line from (0, 0) to the point on the demand curve. Flip it horizontally across the point (equivalent to multiplying its slope by -1). Said line is the slope if |_ε_| = 1. Compare the slope of the demand curve at that point to said line. If the (absolute) slope of the demand curve is higher, then it is _inelastic_. If the (absolute) slope of the demand curve is lower, then it is _elastic_. Otherwise, it is _unit elastic_. Extreme cases are covered by respectively vertical line (_perfectly inelastic_) and horizontal line (_perfectly elastic_). <!--SR:!2025-02-16,83,371!2025-03-06,98,382-->
    - price elasticity of demand / graph / linear demand ::@:: Using the above method, we can see for linear demand, the top-left portion is elastic, the bottom-right portion is inelastic, and a point in between them is unit elastic. <p> An alternative way to see it is by rearranging the formula: $$E_{(P)} = \frac {\Delta Q / Q} {\Delta P / P} = \frac {\Delta Q} {\Delta P} \cdot \frac P Q \,,$$ and we can see $\frac {\Delta Q} {\Delta P}$ is constant, but $\frac P Q$ changes. <!--SR:!2025-03-11,103,386!2025-03-10,102,379-->
  - price elasticity of demand / revenue ::@:: Revenue (not subtracted by cost) is the area of the rectangle enclosed by (0, 0) and the equilibrium point. <p> By changing the equilibrium point along the demand curve, we can see that the point where price elasticity of demand is unit elastic maximizes the area of the rectangle, so revenue is maximized. Thus, we can derive the following rules: If demand is elastic, we should decrease price to maximize revenue, and vice versa for inelastic demand. <!--SR:!2025-03-11,103,386!2025-02-05,74,362-->
  - price elasticity of demand / application ::@:: There is drug-related crime. We can either try to interdict or educate. Assume both policies work equally effectively. <p> Interdiction decreases the supply (curve) of drugs, while education decreases the demand (curve) of drugs. <p> For the former, inelastic demand curve increases expenditure on drugs while elastic demand curve decreases expenditure on drugs. For the latter, both inelastic and elastic demand curve decreases expenditure on drugs, but inelastic demand curve leads to a higher decrease. Comparing the two methods given the same elasticity, the latter is more effective than the former at reducing expenditure. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,77,310!2025-02-12,79,371-->
- [cross elasticity of demand](../../../../general/cross%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md) ::@:: It measures the effect of changes in the price of one good on the quantity demanded of another good. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,99,382!2025-03-01,94,379-->
  - cross elasticity of demand / formula ::@:: _All other things being equal_, $$\text{XED} = \frac {\%\text{ change in quantity demanded of good A} } {\%\text{ change in price of good B} }  \,.$$ We use the starting point formula for percentage change. <!--SR:!2025-02-22,88,371!2025-02-27,92,371-->
    - cross elasticity of demand / formula / other formulas ::@:: There are at least two other common formulas for the cross elasticity of demand, but we will ignore them for now. (We use the starting point formula for percentage change.) <!--SR:!2025-03-07,99,382!2025-03-05,97,382-->
  - cross elasticity of demand / sign ::@:: Positive means the goods are substitutes, negative means the goods are complements, and zero means the goods are independent. <!--SR:!2025-02-09,73,362!2025-02-26,92,379-->
- [income elasticity of demand](../../../../general/income%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md) ::@:: It is the responsivenesses of the quantity demanded for a good to a change in consumer income. <!--SR:!2025-03-11,103,386!2025-03-04,97,379-->
  - income elasticity of demand / formula ::@:: _All other things being equal_, $$\epsilon_{d}= \frac {\%\ {\text{change in quantity demanded} } } {\%\ {\text{change in income} } } \,.$$ We use the starting point formula for percentage change. <!--SR:!2025-03-04,97,382!2025-02-18,85,371-->

  - income elasticity of demand / sign ::@:: It is positive for normal goods. For normal goods, elastic means the good is luxury while inelastic means the good is necessary. Negative elasticity is possible for inferior goods. <!--SR:!2025-02-08,72,358!2025-02-27,93,386-->
    - [inferior good](../../../../general/inferior%20good.md)
- [price elasticity of supply](../../../../general/price%20elasticity%20of%20supply.md) ::@:: It is a measure used in economics to show the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity supplied of a good or service to a change in its price. <!--SR:!2025-02-21,87,371!2025-03-02,95,379-->
  - price elasticity of supply / formula ::@:: _All other things being equal_, $$E_{(P)} = \frac {\Delta Q / Q} {\Delta P / P} \,,$$ where $P$ is the _initial_ (not _final_ or _average_) price of the good supplied, $\Delta P$ is how much it changed, $Q$ is the _initial_ (not _final_ or _average_) quantity of the good supplied, and $\Delta Q$ is how much it changed. We use the starting point formula for percentage change. <!--SR:!2025-02-18,85,371!2025-02-21,87,371-->
    - price elasticity of supply / formula / other formulas ::@:: There are at least two other common formulas for the price elasticity of supply, but we will ignore them for now. (We use the starting point formula for percentage change.) <!--SR:!2025-03-06,98,378!2025-02-14,81,370-->
  - price elasticity of supply / sign ::@:: It is usually positive. However, negative elasticity is possible under economies of scale... <!--SR:!2025-02-18,85,371!2025-02-16,83,371-->
  - price elasticity of supply / factors ::@:: In general, the easier a producer can change the quantity of goods produced, the higher the price elasticity of supply. Two major factors are: resource substitution possibilities and time frame. <!--SR:!2025-03-04,97,382!2025-03-09,101,382-->
    - price elasticity of supply / factors / resource substitution possibilities (substitution effect in production) ::@:: If the inputs of a good is easily changed to produce other goods, its elasticity is higher, and vice versa. <!--SR:!2025-02-06,71,362!2025-03-02,95,371-->
    - price elasticity of supply / factors / time frame ::@:: The longer the time frame we are considering, the higher the elasticity, and vice versa. In more details, the longer the time frame, the more the producer can change its production methods to adapt to the new price. <p> An example is setting up a new plant to produce other things. Notice that setting up a new plant takes a long time. <!--SR:!2025-02-16,83,371!2025-03-04,97,382-->
      - [long run and short run](../../../../general/long%20run%20and%20short%20run.md)
  - price elasticity of supply / graph ::@:: How to see if the price elasticity of supply is elastic or inelastic on a point on the supply curve? <p> Ensure the graph corner is (0, 0) and the graph is not truncated. Draw a line from (0, 0) to the point on the supply curve. Said line is the slope if |_ε_| = 1. Compare the slope of the supply curve at that point to said line. If the (absolute) slope of the supply curve is higher, then it is _inelastic_. If the (absolute) slope of the supply curve is lower, then it is _elastic_. Otherwise, it is _unit elastic_. Extreme cases are covered by respectively vertical line (_perfectly inelastic_) and horizontal line (_perfectly elastic_). <!--SR:!2025-02-24,90,379!2025-02-22,88,371-->
    - price elasticity of demand / graph / linear supply ::@:: For linearly supply, if the line passes through the origin, it is _unit elastic_. If the line passes through the _y_-axis above the origin, it is _elastic_. If the line passes through the _y_-axis below the origin, it is _inelastic_. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,98,379!2025-09-21,250,362-->
    - price elasticity of demand / graph / normal assumptions ::@:: Normally, the supply curve is increasingly sloped. This means the supply curve becomes less elastic as quantity increases. This is often due to capacity limits. <!--SR:!2025-03-01,94,379!2025-02-13,80,371-->

Suppose population growth causes demand for both double. What happens to the equilibrium price and quantity? <p> To model this, we draw a more elastic supply curve and a less elastic supply curve. Then, draw a demand curve. Draw the new demand curve by doubling the quantity at each price level. This should make the new demand curve have half the absolute slope of the old demand curve. <p> Finally, you should find out that for the more elastic supply curve, quantity changes more than the price, while for the less elastic supply curve, price changes more than the quantity.  <p> Intuition may be obtained by realizing that the equilibrium quantity must be a point on the unchanged supply curve. <!--SR:!2025-02-12,78,367!2025-03-22,95,327-->
- cross elasticity of supply ::@:: It measures the effect of changes in the price of one good on the quantity supplied of another good. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,121,387!2025-03-10,95,367-->
  - cross elasticity of supply / formula ::@:: _All other things being equal_, $$\text{XES} = \frac {\%\text{ change in quantity supplied of good A} } {\%\text{ change in price of good B} }  \,.$$ We use the starting point formula for percentage change. <!--SR:!2025-03-09,94,367!2025-04-11,127,387-->
    - cross elasticity of supply / formula / other formulas ::@:: There are at least two other common formulas for the cross elasticity of supply, but we will ignore them for now. (We use the starting point formula for percentage change.) <!--SR:!2025-04-09,125,387!2025-04-08,124,387-->
  - cross elasticity of supply / sign ::@:: Positive means the goods are complements in production, negative means the goods are substitutes in production, and zero means the goods are independent in production. <!--SR:!2025-04-12,128,387!2025-04-04,120,387-->

- [scarcity](../../../../general/scarcity.md)
  - scarcity / competition ::@:: _Scarcity_ necessities _competition_. We must compete to get the scarce thing. <p> Competition can come in many forms, such as boxing fight, running race, beauty, etc. Different ways of competition have different _winners_. If you can control the way of competition, you would likely choose the one that gives yourself the most favorable outcome out of self-interest. <p> Free market economy is also a form of competition, an economic way to allocate scarce resources. <!--SR:!2025-04-06,122,387!2025-04-04,120,387-->
    - scarcity / competition / examples ::@:: academia, free market economy, medical services, police services, etc. <!--SR:!2025-03-08,93,367!2025-04-13,129,387-->
    - scarcity / competition / free market economy ::@:: Does free market economy do a good job? What criteria will you use to determine this? It could be efficiency, ethics, fairness, or "I like it"... <p> In positive economics, we use _efficiency_. More specifically, it is the _gains from trade_. In an economy, this is the _social surplus_ or _total surplus_, which is the sum of _consumer surplus_ and _producer surplus_ (plus _government revenue_ if there is tax, or minus _government expenditure_ if there is subsidy). <!--SR:!2025-02-22,86,367!2025-02-15,80,367-->
- [gains from trade](../../../../general/gains%20from%20trade.md)
- [economic surplus](../../../../general/economic%20surplus.md) ::@:: either _consumer surplus_ or _producer surplus_ <!--SR:!2025-04-05,121,387!2025-04-04,120,387-->
  - consumer surplus ::@:: It is the monetary gain obtained by consumers because they are able to purchase a product for a price that is less than the highest price that they would be _willing to pay_. <!--SR:!2025-04-12,128,387!2025-04-08,124,387-->
    - [willingness to pay](../../../../general/willingness%20to%20pay.md)
    - consumer surplus / calculation ::@:: Calculate the highest price that consumers would be _willing to pay_ minus the actual price paid for each unit. The sum over all units actually bought is the __consumer surplus__. <p> In general, this is the area above the equilibrium price of the good and below the demand curve. <!--SR:!2025-04-06,122,387!2025-04-09,125,387-->
    - consumer surplus / interpretation ::@:: It is _usually_ a good measurement of economic well-being (welfare) of a society. But there are controversial ones, such as drugs, trade for human organs, etc. where there is a difference between individual and society perspective. <!--SR:!2025-04-07,123,387!2025-03-06,91,367-->
  - producer surplus ::@:: It is the amount that producers benefit by selling at a market price that is higher than the least that they would be _willing to sell for_; this is roughly equal to profit (since producers are not normally willing to sell at a loss and are normally indifferent to selling at a break-even price). <!--SR:!2025-04-07,123,387!2025-04-13,129,387-->
    - producer surplus / calculation ::@:: Calculate the actual price minus the lowest price that producers would be _willing to sell for_ for each unit. The sum over all units actually sold is the __producer surplus__. <p> In general, this is the area below the equilibrium price but above the supply curve. <!--SR:!2025-04-08,124,387!2025-03-09,94,367-->
- demand schedule
  - demand schedule table ::@:: It is a table. The left column shows the price (ranges), in decreasing amount. The right column shows the quantity demanded, in increasing amount. For break-even price, we assume the relevant consumers still consume. <!--SR:!2025-01-30,65,367!2025-01-27,61,347-->
- supply schedule
  - supply schedule table ::@:: It is a table. The left column shows the price (ranges), in decreasing amount. The right column shows the quantity supplied, in decreasing amount. For break-even price, we assume the relevant producers still supply. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,121,387!2025-01-30,65,367-->
- [economic surplus](../../../../general/economic%20surplus.md)
  - total surplus ::@:: The sum of _consumer surplus_ and _producer surplus_ (plus _government revenue_ if there is tax, or minus _government expenditure_ if there is subsidy). <!--SR:!2025-04-07,123,387!2025-04-05,121,387-->
    - total surplus / calculation ::@:: Add the _consumer surplus_ and _produce surplus_. Additionally, add _government revenue_ if there is tax, or minus _government expenditure_ if there is subsidy. <p> Alternatively, calculate the highest price that consumers would be _willing to pay_ minus the lowest price that producers would be _willing to sell for_ for each unit for each unit. The sum over all units actually traded is the __total surplus__. <p> In general, this is the area above the supply curve and below the demand curve. This works even if there is government intervention (e.g. tax, subsidy, etc.). <!--SR:!2025-04-13,129,387!2025-03-10,95,367-->
    - total surplus / maximization ::@:: It is maximized when the actual quantity traded is the equilibrium quantity. In __overproduction__, the value to the buyer is below the cost of production for the _overproduced units_. In __underproduction__, the value to the buyer is above the cost of production for the _un-produced units_, so more units can be produced to increase the total surplus further. <p> From an economic perspective, this is _efficient_, no matter under what form of competition. <!--SR:!2025-02-17,82,367!2025-04-10,126,387-->
    - total surplus / division ::@:: Note that the equilibrium price decides how the total surplus is divided into consumer surplus and producer surplus. The division may not be _fair_ in your view: the consumer surplus can be much larger or much smaller than the producer surplus. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,121,387!2025-04-10,126,387-->
- [planned economy](../../../../general/planned%20economy.md) ::@:: It is a type of economic system where investment, production and the allocation of capital goods takes place according to economy-wide economic plans and production plans. <!--SR:!2025-02-21,85,367!2025-03-07,92,367-->
  - planned economy / efficiency ::@:: Theoretically, if the _planner_ knows the demand curve and supply curve perfectly, and absolute authority on how units are produced and allocated, then you can try to simulate a free market economy by producing Q\*, then allocating them to consumers with the highest _willingness to pay_. <p> In practice, the above assumptions are very difficult to achieve in the first place (__information problem__). Even if the above assumptions hold, the _planner_ needs to allocate things in the above way ("benevolent" planner). <!--SR:!2025-04-11,127,387!2025-04-06,122,387-->
- [market economy](../../../../general/market%20economy.md)
  - market economy / efficiency ::@:: Under _perfect information_, market incorporates all information of buyers and sellers. Furthermore, the self-interests of buyers and sellers makes the produced resources allocated to buyers with the highest _willingness to pay_. It is like there is an _invisible hand_. <!--SR:!2025-04-06,122,387!2025-04-10,126,387-->
    - [invisible hand](../../../../general/invisible%20hand.md) ::@:: It is a metaphor inspired by the Scottish economist and moral philosopher Adam Smith that describes the incentives which _free markets_ sometimes create for self-interested people to accidentally act in the public interest, even when this is not something they intended. <!--SR:!2025-04-03,119,387!2025-04-07,123,387-->
  - market economy / limitations ::@:: Markets can fail to achieve efficiency in some situations. This is called __market failure__. Some situations include when the market is not _perfectly competitive_, __externalities__, and the good is a __public good__. <p> The _government_ can step in in these situations to try to achieve efficiency. This will be discussed later. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,121,387!2025-04-08,124,387-->
    - [market failure](../../../../general/market%20failure.md) ::@:: It is a situation in which the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not _Pareto efficient_, often leading to a net loss of economic value. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,90,367!2025-02-01,65,347-->
    - [externality](../../../../general/externality.md) ::@:: It is an _indirect cost or benefit_ to an uninvolved third party that arises as an effect of another party's (or parties') activity. <!--SR:!2025-04-06,122,387!2025-04-07,123,387-->
    - [public good](../../../../general/public%20good%20(economics).md) ::@:: It is a good that is both _non-excludable_ and _non-rivalrous_. Use by one person neither prevents access by other people, nor does it reduce availability to others. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,121,387!2025-04-04,120,387-->

  - assignment: [problem set 7](assignments/problem%20set%207/submission.md)
- [price controls](../../../../general/price%20controls.md) ::@:: They are restrictions set in place and enforced by governments, on the prices that can be charged for goods and services in a market. It could be a price ceiling or a price floor. <!--SR:!2025-04-06,120,390!2025-02-23,85,370-->
  - price controls / motivation ::@:: People may believe the equilibrium price is not appropriate or desirable from their perspective. <!--SR:!2025-04-14,128,390!2025-04-06,120,390-->
- [price ceiling](../../../../general/price%20ceiling.md) ::@:: It is a government- or group-imposed price control, or limit, on how high a price is charged for a product, commodity, or service. Examples include rent control. <!--SR:!2025-04-12,126,390!2025-04-15,129,390-->
  - [rent regulation](../../../../general/rent%20regulation.md) ::@:: It is a system of laws for the rental market of dwellings, with controversial effects on affordability of housing and tenancies. <!--SR:!2025-04-13,127,390!2025-04-09,123,390-->
- [price floor](../../../../general/price%20floor.md) ::@:: It is a government- or group-imposed price control or limit on how low a price can be charged for a product, good, commodity, or service. Examples include minimum wage. <!--SR:!2025-02-19,81,370!2025-04-11,125,390-->
  - [minimum wage](../../../../general/minimum%20wage.md) ::@:: It is the lowest remuneration that employers can legally pay their employees—the price floor below which employees may not sell their labor. <!--SR:!2025-04-16,130,390!2025-04-15,129,390-->
- price controls
  - price controls / motivation
    - price controls / motivation / government ::@:: health, protect low-income group, protect low-skill workers, special interest groups (e.g. voting) <!--SR:!2025-03-30,115,390!2025-04-11,125,390-->
- [price ceiling](../../../../general/price%20ceiling.md)
  - price ceiling / graph ::@:: On a supply and demand graph, draw a horizontal line that represents the price ceiling. If the equilibrium price is lower than or equal to the price ceiling, nothing interesting happens. Otherwise, the price will be capped to the price ceiling. <p> For normal supply and demand curve, the quantity demanded (Qd') is higher than the quantity supplied (Qs'). The difference between them is the shortage. <!--SR:!2025-04-16,130,390!2025-01-31,62,350-->
    - price ceiling / graph / economic surplus ::@:: Compare the economic surplus before and after imposing the price ceiling. the producer surplus decreases, while the consumer surplus may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged. The total surplus decreases, and this decrease is known as __deadweight loss__. We can also see that some producer surplus becomes consumer surplus due to _lower price_ (reallocation), while the rest becomes deadweight loss due to decrease in _quantity supplied_. Some consumer surplus also becomes deadweight loss due to decrease in _quantity supplied_. <!--SR:!2025-04-06,120,390!2025-04-07,121,390-->
      - [deadweight loss](../../../../general/deadweight%20loss.md) ::@:: It is the loss of societal economic welfare due to production/consumption of a good at a quantity where marginal benefit (to society) does not equal marginal cost (to society) – in other words, there are either goods being produced despite the cost of doing so being larger than the benefit, or additional goods are not being produced despite the fact that the benefits of their production would be larger than the costs. <!--SR:!2025-04-09,123,390!2025-02-20,82,370-->
  - price ceiling / allocation ::@:: Under price ceiling, price and willingness to pay is no longer the dominant factor in determining who gets the scarce resources. Those with lower willingness to pay can compete with those with higher willingness to pay due to the price ceiling. Other __price rationing methods__ and __non-price rationing methods__ may appear to allocate said resources (e.g. lottery, social). <!--SR:!2025-04-10,124,390!2025-03-01,86,370-->
    - price ceiling / allocation / price rationing methods ::@:: Usually such mechanisms still let those with higher willingness to pay to get the scarce resource, preventing further decrease in consumer surplus. Examples include black market (higher price than price ceiling), grey-area payment, etc. <p> These methods tend to transfer economic surplus back from consumer surplus to producer surplus, and increases the quantity supplied, i.e. tends to the economy equilibrium. <p> _Corruption_ is also similar to black market, so it may be beneficial to the society in the short run, but creates inefficiency in the long run. <!--SR:!2025-04-08,122,390!2025-01-31,62,350-->
      - [black market](../../../../general/black%20market.md) ::@:: It is a clandestine market or series of transactions that has some aspect of illegality or is not compliant with an institutional set of rules. <!--SR:!2025-03-08,91,370!2025-04-01,117,390-->
    - price ceiling / allocation / non-price rationing methods ::@:: Usually such mechanisms let those with lower willingness to pay to have a chance to get the scarce resource, further decreasing consumer surplus. Examples include landlords picking tenants they prefer, lottery by government, etc. <!--SR:!2025-03-31,116,390!2025-02-24,86,370-->
  - price ceiling / benefit & loss ::@:: It seems fair to buyers who can pay a lower price. But also consider buyers who cannot do so due to shortage. Also, black markets may raise the actual price beyond the price ceiling. Deadweight loss means society as a whole is harmed. <!--SR:!2025-02-01,69,370!2025-04-14,128,390-->
  - price ceiling / enforcement ::@:: If enforcement is completely effective, the price ceiling is the actual price. But in practice, enforcement is not completely effective, then black markets appear, which increases actual supply and actual price, tending towards the economic equilibrium. In the extreme case of no enforcement, the price ceiling may do nothing, and the price and quantity stay at the economic equilibrium. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,89,370!2025-04-14,128,390-->
    - price ceiling / enforcement / corruption ::@:: Corruption is somewhat similar to black market, so it may improve economic efficiency in the short run. However, corruption also involves non-price elements, requiring a special type of social network. People spend resources that could have been used for other productive resources on building up such a social network. As a result, efficiency decreases in the long run. <!--SR:!2025-02-21,83,370!2025-02-25,87,370-->
  - price ceiling / short run and long run ::@:: The supply and demand curve differs in the short run and long run. Compare with in the short run, the long run curves are more elastic and thus more flatten. The shortage becomes even more serious. <!--SR:!2025-04-13,127,390!2025-04-03,119,390-->
    - price ceiling / short run and long run / interpretation ::@:: For suppliers, price ceiling means in the long run, they switch production to other goods, so supply decreases further. Also, suppliers may try to cut costs, such as poor maintenance on rental apartment ("het best way to destroy a city is by rent control"). <p> For consumers, price ceiling means in the long run, due to the substitution effect, demand increases further. <p> As a result, the shortage becomes more serious in the long run. <!--SR:!2025-04-13,127,390!2025-02-18,80,370-->
- [price floor](../../../../general/price%20floor.md)
  - price floor / graph ::@:: Ony a supply and demand graph, draw a horizontal line that represents the price floor. If the equilibrium price is higher than or equal to the price floor, nothing interesting happens. Otherwise, the price will be capped to the price floor. <p> For normal supply and demand curve, the quantity demanded (Qd') is lower than the quantity supplied (Qs'). The difference between them is the _excess supply_ or _surplus_ (in labor market, this is _unemployment_). <!--SR:!2025-04-06,120,390!2025-03-02,87,370-->
    - price floor / graph / economic surplus ::@:: Compare the economic surplus before and after imposing the price floor. the producer surplus may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged, while the consumer surplus decreases. The total surplus decreases, and this decrease is known as __deadweight loss__. We can also see that some consumer surplus becomes producer surplus due to _higher price_ (reallocation), while the rest becomes deadweight loss due to decrease in _quantity demanded_. Some producer surplus also becomes deadweight loss due to decrease in _quantity demanded_. <!--SR:!2025-03-08,91,370!2025-02-21,83,370-->
      - [deadweight loss](../../../../general/deadweight%20loss.md)
  - price floor / allocation ::@:: Under price floor, price and willingness to sell is no longer the dominant factor in determining who supplies the scarce resources. Those with lower willingness to sell can compete with those with higher willingness to sell due to the price floor. Other __price rationing methods__ and __non-price rationing methods__ may appear to supply said resources (e.g. lottery, social). <!--SR:!2025-04-12,126,390!2025-04-16,130,390-->
    - price floor / allocation / price rationing methods ::@:: Usually such mechanisms still let those with higher willingness to sell to supply the scarce resource, preventing further decrease in producer surplus. Examples include black market (lower price than price floor), grey-area payment, etc. <p> These methods tend to transfer economic surplus back from producer surplus to consumer surplus, and increases the quantity supplied, i.e. tends to the economy equilibrium. <!--SR:!2025-04-16,130,390!2025-04-16,130,390-->
      - [black market](../../../../general/black%20market.md)
    - price floor / allocation / non-price rationing methods ::@:: Usually such mechanisms let those with lower willingness to sell to have a chance to supply the scarce resource, further decreasing producer surplus. <!--SR:!2025-04-02,118,390!2025-01-29,60,350-->
  - price floor / benefit & loss ::@:: It seems fair to suppliers who can get paid a higher price. But also consider suppliers who cannot do so due to surplus. Also, markets may reduce the actual price beyond the price floor. Deadweight loss means society as a whole is harmed. <!--SR:!2025-04-09,123,390!2025-04-15,129,390-->
    - price floor / benefit & loss / labor markets ::@:: In a labor market, teenagers, elderly, those with low productivity, etc. are more likely not to be hired in a price floor. The labor markets for them likely have their equilibrium prices below the price floor. High productivity workers, skilled labor, etc. may not be affected by the price floor. The labor markets for them likely have their equilibrium prices above the price floor. <p> This shows an economy can have multiple markets. <!--SR:!2025-04-14,128,390!2025-04-02,118,390-->
  - price floor / enforcement ::@:: If enforcement is completely effective, the price floor is the actual price. But in practice, enforcement is not completely effective, then black markets appear, which increases actual demand and decreases actual price, tending towards the economic equilibrium. In the extreme case of no enforcement, the price floor may do nothing, and the price and quantity stay at the economic equilibrium. <!--SR:!2025-04-04,120,390!2025-03-03,88,370-->
  - price floor / short run and long run ::@:: The supply and demand curve differs in the short run and long run. Compare with in the short run, the long run curves are more elastic and thus more flatten. The surplus becomes even more serious. <!--SR:!2025-04-14,128,390!2025-04-03,119,390-->
    - price floor / short run and long run / interpretation ::@:: For suppliers, price floor means in the long run, they switch production to said goods, so supply increases further. For labor markets, more people may want to join the job market, e.g. dropping out of school early. <p> For consumers, price floor means in the long run, due to the substitution effect, demand decreases further. For labor markets, this may mean companies are forced out of business. Companies may also turn to automation to replace labor. <p> As a result, the surplus becomes more serious in the long run. <!--SR:!2025-03-12,95,370!2025-02-22,84,370-->
- [price controls](../../../../general/price%20controls.md)
  - [price controls](../../../../general/price%20controls.md) / summary ::@:: People respond to incentives smartly. Price controls intervene with the price signal in a market. If enforcement is perfect, then it "works". Otherwise, black markets and other allocation methods appear, some of which tends the actual price and quantity to the economic equilibrium, while some others decrease economic surpluses further. <p> Regardless of enforcement, the total surplus decreases (_deadweight loss_). Price controls is only effective for reallocating the total surplus in between consumer surplus and producer surplus. But even then, it may decrease the surplus it intends to increase because the total surplus has decreased by too much. <!--SR:!2025-04-08,122,390!2025-04-07,121,390-->

- income tax quote ::@:: "The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax." — Albert Einstein <!--SR:!2025-04-02,118,390!2025-04-08,122,390-->
- [tax](../../../../general/tax.md) ::@:: It is a mandatory financial charge or levy imposed on a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization to support government spending and public expenditures collectively or to regulate and reduce negative externalities. <!--SR:!2025-04-15,129,390!2025-02-23,85,370-->
  - tax / motivation ::@:: The government needs money to operate its infrastructure, legal system, military, etc. The government can also use it as a policy tool for public health, imports, income redistribution, etc. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,124,390!2025-04-10,124,390-->
  - tax / examples ::@:: corporate tax, income tax, sales tax, tariff (import tax) <!--SR:!2025-04-11,125,390!2025-04-12,126,390-->
  - [tax incidence](../../../../general/tax%20incidence.md) ::@:: It is the effect of a particular tax on the distribution of economic welfare. Economists distinguish between the entities who ultimately bear the tax burden and those on whom the tax is initially imposed. The tax burden measures the true economic effect of the tax, measured by the difference between real incomes or utilities before and after imposing the tax, and taking into account how the tax causes prices to change. <!--SR:!2025-02-20,82,370!2025-01-31,62,350-->
    - tax incidence / intuition ::@:: Compare the price (including the tax) before and after the tax. If the price rises by the tax amount, then buyers pay the tax. If the price does not rise at all, then sellers pay the tax. In between, buyers and sellers share the tax burden. <!--SR:!2025-02-28,90,370!2025-04-02,118,390-->
- [tax](../../../../general/tax.md)
  - tax / types ::@:: _ad valorem_ tax (tax according to value), per unit tax, ... <!--SR:!2025-04-16,130,390!2025-04-08,122,390-->
    - [_ad valorem_ tax](../../../../general/ad%20valorem%20tax.md) ::@:: A tax whose amount is based on the value of a transaction or of a property. <p> The supply or demand curves shift horizontally, touching the initial curve when the price is zero and increasingly deviating as the price grows. <!--SR:!2025-04-03,119,390!2025-04-14,128,390-->
    - [per unit tax](../../../../general/per%20unit%20tax.md) ::@:: A tax that is defined as a fixed amount for each unit of a good or service sold. <p> The supply or demand curve shifts horizontally, with a fixed gap between the initial curve and the final curve. <!--SR:!2025-04-16,130,390!2025-02-26,88,370-->
  - tax incidence / target ::@:: Tax may be imposed on the seller or buyer (or both). The one who has tax imposed on has its curve shifted. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,124,390!2025-03-07,90,370-->
  - [effect of taxes and subsidies on price](../../../../general/effect%20of%20taxes%20and%20subsidies%20on%20price.md)
  - tax incidence / graph ::@:: For simplicity, we only consider _per unit tax_. Depending if the seller or buyer has tax imposed on, the corresponding curve is shifted horizontally. If you consider both cases, you obtain two different new points the curves meet on. One of the point is higher than the other in price, but their quantities are the same. <p> After we take the tax into account, we would find that in both cases, buyers pay at the point that is higher in price, while sellers receive at the point that is lower in price, so it turns out both cases have the same effect. The tax burden of a side is simply the difference of the price to that side compared to the equilibrium price without tax. For sellers, this is the equilibrium price subtracted by the lower price. For buyers, this is the higher price subtracted by the equilibrium price. <!--SR:!2025-04-12,126,390!2025-04-11,125,390-->
    - tax incidence / graph / alternative ::@:: For simplicity, we only consider _per unit tax_. If so, then there is an alternative way to see the effect of tax on a graph. Tax moves the quantity to a point where the demand curve is higher than the supply curve by the tax amount. For _per unit tax_, this amount is fixed. So we can easily find the new quantity this way. <!--SR:!2025-04-13,127,390!2025-03-31,116,390-->
  - tax incidence / elasticity ::@:: It turns out tax incidence depends on the _relative_ elasticities of the supply and demand curve compared to each other. The rule is simple: the more elastic the supply or demand curve, the less relative burden the corresponding side bears. Of course, remember that it is _relative_ elasticities between them that matters. <p> This can be easily seen by using the alternative way to visualize tax incidence on a graph, and then realize that for both the supply and demand curve, the closer the curve is to a horizontal line, the more elastic it is. <!--SR:!2025-03-09,92,370!2025-04-03,119,390-->
    - tax incidence / elasticity / perfectly elastic demand ::@:: If supply is unit elastic and demand is perfectly elastic, then the supply bears all tax burden. The demand can completely "escape" the tax. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,124,390!2025-04-01,117,390-->
    - tax incidence / elasticity / perfectly inelastic demand ::@:: If supply is unit elastic and demand is perfectly inelastic, then the demand bears all tax burden. The demand cannot "escape" the tax at all, even by a slight amount. <!--SR:!2025-04-16,130,390!2025-04-12,126,390-->
    - tax incidence / elasticity / perfectly elastic supply ::@:: If supply is perfectly elastic and demand is unit elastic, then the demand bears all tax burden. The supply can completely "escape" the tax. <!--SR:!2025-04-02,118,390!2025-04-02,118,390-->
    - tax incidence / elasticity / perfectly inelastic supply ::@:: If supply is perfectly inelastic and demand is unit elastic, then the supply bears all tax burden. The supply cannot "escape" the tax at all, even by a slight amount. <!--SR:!2025-04-11,125,390!2025-04-14,128,390-->
    - tax incidence / elasticity / supply is more elastic than demand ::@:: If supply is more elastic than demand, the supply bears less tax burden. The supply can "escape" _more_ than the demand. <!--SR:!2025-04-09,123,390!2025-04-16,130,390-->
    - tax incidence / elasticity / supply is less elastic than demand ::@:: If supply is less elastic than demand, the supply bears more tax burden. The supply can "escape" _less_ than the demand. <!--SR:!2025-04-14,128,390!2025-04-11,125,390-->
    - tax incidence / elasticity / application ::@:: 1990: Congress adopted a luxury tax on yachts, private airplanes, furs, expensive cars, etc. to raise revenue from those who could most easily afford to pay—wealthy consumers. But was it true that the wealthy cusomters paid this tax? <p> Compare the _relative elasticities_. Supply is inelastic _in the short run_, while demand is elastic because the goods are luxury. So the supply (the luxury producers) bears more tax burden than the demand (wealthy customers) _in the short run_. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,119,390!2025-04-14,128,390-->

- [tax incidence](../../../../general/tax%20incidence.md)
  - tax incidence / deadweight loss ::@:: Similar to price ceiling and price floor, the quantity supplied and demanded will be below the equilibrium quantity due to tax. This creates deadweight loss, which shows up in the same area in the graph. <p> The deadweight loss triangle can be split into two by the equilibrium price line. Above is the consumer surplus lost due to price being higher due to tax. Below is the producer surplus lost due to producers being forced to produce at a cheaper price in order to make profit. <!--SR:!2025-04-13,127,390!2025-04-05,119,390-->
    - [deadweight loss](../../../../general/deadweight%20loss.md)
    - tax incidence / deadweight loss / implications ::@:: So tax, while useful for the government, creates a net loss to the society. The government should choose the goods to be taxed carefully to minimize deadweight loss. <!--SR:!2025-04-06,120,390!2025-04-15,129,390-->
    - tax incidence / deadweight loss / elasticity ::@:: For simplicity, consider _per unit tax_ only. Elasticities of both the demand and supply curves determine the deadweight loss. Increase in the elasticity of the demand or supply curve (or both) increases the deadweight loss. <p> This can be visualized by realizing the deadweight loss triangle's base length is always the same: the per unit tax amount, and its height is determined by the elasticities of both the demand and supply curves. Since more elastic curves are closer to a horizontal line, this increases the height of the deadweight loss triangle. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,119,390!2025-03-13,96,370-->
      - tax incidence / deadweight loss / elasticity / inelastic supply ::@:: When supply is inelastic, deadweight loss is smaller. It is hard for producers to "escape" the market. <!--SR:!2025-04-15,129,390!2025-04-05,119,390-->
      - tax incidence / deadweight loss / elasticity / elastic supply ::@:: When supply is elastic, deadweight loss is larger. It is easy for producers to "escape" the market. <!--SR:!2025-04-16,130,390!2025-04-07,121,390-->
      - tax incidence / deadweight loss / elasticity / inelastic demand ::@:: When demand is inelastic, deadweight loss is smaller. It is hard for consumers to "escape" the market. <!--SR:!2025-04-03,119,390!2025-04-09,123,390-->
      - tax incidence / deadweight loss / elasticity / elastic demand ::@:: When demand is elastic, deadweight loss is larger. It is easy for consumers to "escape" the market. <!--SR:!2025-04-15,129,390!2025-04-04,120,390-->
  - tax revenue ::@:: The __tax revenue__ is the area of rectangle extended to the left from the deadweight loss triangle in a graph. It can be split into two portions by the equilibrium price line. Above is the consumer surplus transferred to the government. Below is the producer surplus transferred to the government. <!--SR:!2025-03-12,95,370!2025-04-07,121,390-->
- [tax](../../../../general/tax.md)
  - tax / government ::@:: The government uses tax to provide public services and redistribute wealth from high-income group to low-income group. However, tax cannot be too high, or otherwise deadweight loss is high. (For example, if income tax (on labor) is high, you may not want to work.) <!--SR:!2025-04-15,129,390!2025-04-07,121,390-->
    - tax / government / welfare state ::@:: In a welfare state, the government may have high taxes to provide all kinds of welfare to its citizens. However, the deadweight loss may make this ineffective. For developed countries with high GDP, the deadweight loss may be bearable, but for developing countries with low GDP, the deadweight loss can be destructive. <!--SR:!2025-03-12,95,370!2025-04-15,129,390-->
      - tax / government / welfare state / failure example ::@:: China adopted "collective" farm/factory system before, that is all people worked in a farm/factory, ate in communal dining place, while the government provided all other services of daily life. <p> The result was no one worked, and the economy collapsed, which lead to economic reform in 1979. After the economic reform, the GDP of China has grown rapidly. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,90,370!2025-01-28,59,350-->
      - [welfare state](../../../../general/welfare%20state.md) ::@:: It is a form of government in which the state (or a well-established network of social institutions) protects and promotes the economic and social well-being of its citizens, based upon the principles of equal opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for citizens unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life. <!--SR:!2025-03-30,115,390!2025-02-19,81,370-->
  - tax revenue
    - tax revenue / factors ::@:: Does a higher tax rate brings more tax revenue? Not necessarily! As tax increases, deadweight loss increases at an increasingly fast rate. Eventually, the deadweight loss reduces the tax revenue by too much. Imagine 100% tax rate: No one will produce and consume, so there is no tax revenue. <p> This can be seen in a supply and demand graph as well. As tax increases, quantity increasingly move to the left, approaching zero. This is the decrease in tax revenue due to deadweight loss. <p> The __Laffer curve__ illustrates a theoretical relationship between rates of taxation and the resulting levels of the government's tax revenue. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,124,390!2025-04-09,123,390-->
      - [Laffer curve](../../../../general/Laffer%20curve.md) ::@:: It illustrates a theoretical relationship between rates of taxation and the resulting levels of the government's tax revenue. It assumes that no tax revenue is raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100%, meaning that there is a tax rate between 0% and 100% that maximizes government tax revenue. <!--SR:!2025-04-08,122,390!2025-04-13,127,390-->

  - assignment: [problem set 9](assignments/problem%20set%209/submission.md)
- [theory of the firm](../../../../general/theory%20of%20the%20firm.md) ::@:: It consists of a number of economic theories that explain and predict the nature of the firm, company, or corporation, including its existence, behaviour, structure, and relationship to the market. <!--SR:!2025-05-10,110,403!2025-04-30,100,403-->
  - theory of the firm / history ::@:: Ronald Coase, Oliver E. Williamson <!--SR:!2025-05-07,107,403!2025-05-09,109,403-->
  - theory of the firm / Ronald Coase ::@:: A firm buys raw materials, components, and professional services from others. Why does it not do all of these by itself? According to this economist, when transactions mediated over the market is too costly (e.g. contract, legal system, verification), firms can serve as an alternative to the market-price mechanism when it is more efficient to produce in a non-market environment. <p> Thus he focused on the _cost of make-or-buy_. <!--SR:!2025-03-31,77,383!2025-05-08,108,403-->
    - theory of the firm / Ronald Coase / example ::@:: When you buy from Apple, technically you are buying the design from Apple, hardware from suppliers, etc. But the transaction costs of doing the above is too high, so you directly buy from Apple without interacting with other firms. <!--SR:!2025-06-17,148,423!2025-06-13,144,423-->
  - theory of the firm / Oliver E. Williamson ::@:: Firms solve some problem with arm's-length market. For example, a coal mine depends on a railroad line. If these two are owned separately, opportunistic behavior arises (given the coal mine needs the railroad line, and the railroad line's only use is the coal mine). Vertical integration, i.e. both are owned by the same firm, solves this problem. Previously, vertical integration was believed to be a way _only_ to acquire market power. <p> Thus he focused on the _cost of governance_. <!--SR:!2025-06-10,141,423!2025-05-08,108,403-->
    - asset specificity ::@:: But where should this vertical integration stop? It depends on the _specificity_ of assets. In the example above, both assets are very _specific_ to each other as they have no or much worse second-best uses. <!--SR:!2025-05-06,106,403!2025-05-08,108,403-->
    - arm's-length transaction ::@:: Business transactions in which buyers and sellers act independently without one party influencing the other. <!--SR:!2025-04-26,103,403!2025-06-13,144,423-->
  - theory of the firm / extensions ::@:: From thinking out of the black box of firms, we also have _contract theory_ and _outsourcing and supply chain_. <!--SR:!2025-04-28,105,403!2025-06-17,148,423-->
- profit
  - profit / types ::@:: two major types: accounting profit, economic profit <!--SR:!2025-06-03,134,423!2025-06-08,138,423-->
  - [accounting profit](../../../../general/profit%20(accounting).md) ::@:: It is an income distributed to the owner in a profitable market production process (business). <p> In other words, accounting revenue minus accounting expenses (this glosses over accounting-specific terms). They are _explicit_ costs that appear on a firm's financial statements. <!--SR:!2025-06-04,134,423!2025-04-18,97,403-->
  - [economic profit](../../../../general/profit%20(economic).md) ::@:: It is the difference between revenue that an economic entity has received from its outputs and total costs of its inputs, also known as _surplus value_. It is equal to total revenue minus total cost, including both _explicit_ and _implicit_ costs. <p> Therefore, economic profit is smaller than accounting profit. <!--SR:!2025-06-16,147,423!2025-03-24,72,383-->
    - economic profit / example ::@:: You earn \$9&nbsp;000 monthly. You want to setup a photography school instead, which has an estimated revenue of \$30&nbsp;000 monthly and estimated expense of \$20&nbsp;000 monthly. <p> Accounting profit is \$10&nbsp;000 monthly, while economic profit is \$1&nbsp;000 monthly. <p> Question: What happens if you earn \$10&nbsp;000 monthly instead? \$11&nbsp;000? <!--SR:!2025-06-06,137,423!2025-06-20,151,423-->
- [production function](../../../../general/production%20function.md) ::@:: It shows the relationship between the _quantity of inputs_ used to produce a good and the _quantity of output_ of that good. <p> It can be represented by a table, equation, or graph. <!--SR:!2025-06-08,139,423!2025-06-03,134,423-->
  - production function / __format__: table ::@:: Column headers name the input on the left and the output on the right. Each row gives the input on the left and the corresponding output on the right. The rows have increasing input. <!--SR:!2025-06-09,140,423!2025-06-09,139,423-->
  - production function / __format__: graph ::@:: Draw a _xy_ graph. The _x_-axis shows the input with its name (e.g. number of workers). The _y_-axis shows the output with its name (e.g. quantity of output). Plot the data points and connect the dots. <!--SR:!2025-06-13,144,423!2025-06-09,140,423-->
- [marginal product](../../../../general/marginal%20product.md) ::@:: It is the increase in output arising from an additional unit of that input, _holding all other inputs constant_ (_ceteris paribus_). <p> If the input is labor, we have the __marginal product of labor__ (__MPL__): $$MPL = \frac {\Delta Q} {\Delta L} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-06-12,143,423!2025-06-15,146,423-->
  - marginal product / importance ::@:: Remember, _rational_ people think at the margin. This concept can help producers decide whether to increase input by comparing it against marginal costs (MC). <!--SR:!2025-06-11,142,423!2025-06-04,135,423-->
- [diminishing returns](../../../../general/diminishing%20returns.md) ::@:: It is the _decrease in marginal (incremental) output_ of a production process as the amount of a single factor of production is incrementally increased, holding all other factors of production equal (_ceteris paribus_). <!--SR:!2025-05-03,103,403!2025-06-18,149,423-->
- [total cost](../../../../general/total%20cost.md) ::@:: It is the _minimum financial cost_ of producing some quantity of output. This is the _total economic cost of production_ and is made up of _variable cost_, which varies according to the quantity of a good produced and includes inputs such as labor and raw materials, plus _fixed cost_, which is independent of the quantity of a good produced and includes inputs that cannot be varied in the short term such as buildings and machinery, including possibly _sunk costs_. <!--SR:!2025-03-31,77,383!2025-04-01,78,383-->
  - total cost / __format__: table ::@:: Usually, the table columns are in this order: quantity (Q), fixed costs (FC), variable costs (VC), total costs (TC), marginal costs (MC), average fixed costs (AFC), average variable costs (AVC), average total costs (ATC). Omitting some of them or reordering them are fine. <!--SR:!2025-06-09,140,423!2025-06-19,150,423-->
- [variable cost](../../../../general/variable%20cost.md) ::@:: They are costs that change as the quantity of the good or service that a business produces changes. Variable costs are the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. They can also be considered normal costs. <!--SR:!2025-03-31,78,383!2025-06-17,148,423-->
- [fixed cost](../../../../general/fixed%20cost.md) ::@:: They are business expenses that are not dependent on the level of goods or services produced by the business. They tend to be recurring, such as interest or rents being paid per month. These costs also tend to be capital costs. <!--SR:!2025-03-27,74,383!2025-03-24,72,383-->
- [marginal cost](../../../../general/marginal%20cost.md) ::@:: It is the change in the total cost that arises when the quantity produced is increased, i.e. the cost of producing additional quantity. In some contexts, it refers to an increment of one unit of output, and in others it refers to the rate of change of total cost as output is increased by an infinitesimal amount. <p> For the discrete case, this is: $$MC = \frac {\Delta TC} {\Delta Q} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-04-22,100,403!2025-06-20,150,423-->
  - marginal cost / importance ::@:: Remember, _rational_ people think at the margin. This concept can help producers decide whether to increase input by comparing it against marginal products (MP). <!--SR:!2025-06-15,146,423!2025-05-04,104,403-->
  - marginal cost / __format__: table ::@:: Since marginal cost is computed from the difference of two total costs at two consecutive quantities, it is better to move the column (except for the column header) down by 0.5 rows. <!--SR:!2025-06-07,138,423!2025-06-11,142,423-->
  - marginal cost / __format__: graph ::@:: Since marginal cost is computed from the difference of two total costs at two consecutive quantities, it is better to plot the points on _Q_ = 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, etc. instead. <!--SR:!2025-04-24,102,403!2025-06-10,141,423-->
- [average cost](../../../../general/average%20cost.md) ::@:: $$AC = \frac {TC} Q$$ <p> There are variants for total costs (TC), ATC; fixed costs (FC), AFC; and variable costs (VC), AVC. <p> Note that it is undefined when quantity is 0. So no need to plot the average costs or show them on a table when the quantity is 0. <!--SR:!2025-06-12,143,423!2025-06-14,145,423-->
  - average cost / equality relation ::@:: $$AFC + AVC = ATC$$ <p> This is evident mathematically... <!--SR:!2025-06-06,137,423!2025-06-16,147,423-->

- datetime: 2024-10-28T16:30:00+08:00/2024-10-28T17:50:00+08:00
- [average cost](../../../../general/average%20cost.md)
  - average cost / graph ::@:: It looks like U-shaped. Whenever MC < AVC/ATC, AVC/ATC is falling. Whenever MC > AVC/ATC, AVC/ATC is rising. (Choose either AVC or ATC.) <p> The __efficient scale__ is the quantity that minimizes ATC. <p> It can also be interpreted as the slope (but _not_ derivative) from the origin to a point on the TC curve. <!--SR:!2025-06-06,137,423!2025-06-06,137,423-->
- [marginal cost](../../../../general/marginal%20cost.md)
  - marginal cost / graph ::@:: It looks like U-shaped. It must go through the minimum of the AVC curves and ATC curves. It reaches its minimum before the minimum of the AVC and ATC curves. (This is evident if you think about it mathematically...) <p> It can also be interpreted as the slope (derivative) of the TC or VC (but not FC) curve. <!--SR:!2025-04-01,78,383!2025-06-09,140,423-->
- [long run and short run](../../../../general/long%20run%20and%20short%20run.md) ::@:: In economics, the __long-run__ is a theoretical concept in which _all markets_ are in equilibrium, and _all prices and quantities_ have fully adjusted and are in equilibrium. The long-run contrasts with the __short-run__, in which there are some constraints and markets are not fully in equilibrium. <!--SR:!2025-04-21,99,403!2025-05-09,109,403-->
  - long run and short run / microeconomics ::@:: There are no _fixed factors of production_ in the __long-run__, and there is enough _time_ for adjustment so that there are no constraints preventing _changing the output level_ by _changing the capital stock or by entering or leaving an industry_. This contrasts with the __short-run__, where some factors are _variable (dependent on the quantity produced)_ and others are _fixed (paid once)_, constraining entry or exit from an industry. <!--SR:!2025-06-08,139,423!2025-05-13,112,403-->
- [average cost](../../../../general/average%20cost.md)
  - average cost / long run ::@:: The ATC at any Q in the _long run_ is cost per unit using the most efficient mix of inputs for that Q (e.g., the factory size with the lowest ATC). That is, the ATC curve is a horizontal line. <!--SR:!2025-04-17,96,403!2025-06-08,139,423-->
- [cost curve](../../../../general/cost%20curve.md) ::@:: It is a graph of the costs of production as a function of total quantity produced. <!--SR:!2025-06-09,140,423!2025-06-04,135,423-->
  - cost curve / types ::@:: short run (SR), long run (LR) <!--SR:!2025-06-07,138,423!2025-06-08,139,423-->
  - cost curve / short run (SR) ::@:: Add "short run" ("SR") before each of the following: fixed cost (FC), variable cost (VC), total cost (TC), marginal cost (MC), average fixed cost (AFC), average variable cost (AVC), average total cost (ATC). <!--SR:!2025-06-19,149,423!2025-04-18,97,403-->
    - cost curve / short run (SR) / shifts ::@:: prices of factors of production, technology <!--SR:!2025-04-01,78,383!2025-06-18,149,423-->
      - cost curve / short run (SR) / shifts / prices of factors of production ::@:: Either FC or VC increases. If FC increases, the FC, TC, AFC, and ATC curves shift up. If VC increases, the VC, TC, AVC, ATC, and MC curves shift up. <!--SR:!2025-05-04,104,403!2025-03-31,77,383-->
      - cost curve / short run (SR) / shifts / technology ::@:: Both cost and product curves are affected. For example, FC increases due to more expensive technology, but VC decreases due to less labor needed. In this case, ATC increases at low output level but decreases at high output levels. <p> Using the example above, the ATC curve starts at a higher point than the old ATC curve, but increases more slowly such that it eventually falls behind the old ATC curve. <!--SR:!2025-05-03,103,403!2025-03-08,60,363-->
  - cost curves / long run (LR) ::@:: Add "long run" ("LR") before each of the following: total cost (TC), marginal cost (MC), average total cost (ATC). <!--SR:!2025-06-18,148,423!2025-06-08,139,423-->
    - cost curves / long run / example ::@:: Say we have 4 factories. We consider using 1 factory, 2 factories, 3 factories, and 4 factories separately. Then each has a different SRATC curve. We want to choose 1 factory usage pattern. <p> Plot the SRATC curves. In the long run, we can vary move labors to an arbitrary factory. So when deciding to output a certain amount, we always choose the factory usage pattern with the lowest SRATC. So the LRATC is the lowest SRATC curve for each output level. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,72,383!2025-06-16,147,423-->
    - cost curves / long run / scale ::@:: The __minimum efficient scale__ is given by the lowest point of the LRATC. Anything before that is __economies of scale__. Anything after that is __diseconomies of scale__. <!--SR:!2025-06-20,151,423!2025-06-20,151,423-->

- [economies of scale](../../../../general/economies%20of%20scale.md) ::@:: When output increases, LRATC falls. <!--SR:!2025-06-10,141,423!2025-06-17,148,423-->
  - economies of scale / causes ::@:: better specialization, bulk buying discount, more options or flexibility (different combination of inputs) in organization production activities <!--SR:!2025-03-29,76,383!2025-05-05,113,403-->
- [diseconomies of scale](../../../../general/diseconomies%20of%20scale.md) ::@:: When output increases, LRATC rises. <!--SR:!2025-06-12,143,423!2025-06-19,150,423-->

- [questions § chapter 14 lecture](questions.md#chapter%2014%20lecture)
- [profit maximization](../../../../general/profit%20maximization.md) ::@:: It is the short run or long run process by which a firm may determine the price, input and output levels that will lead to the highest possible total profit (or just profit in short). <!--SR:!2025-05-10,110,403!2025-03-26,78,383-->
  - profit maximization / mathematics ::@:: $$\mathrm{profit} = TR - TC$$ <!--SR:!2025-06-17,147,423!2025-06-09,140,423-->
- [total revenue](../../../../general/total%20revenue.md) ::@:: It is the total receipts a seller can obtain from selling goods or services to buyers. It can be written as P × Q, which is the price of the goods multiplied by the quantity of the sold goods. <p> $$TR = P \times Q$$ <!--SR:!2025-06-07,138,423!2025-06-03,134,423-->
  - total revenue / __format__: table ::@:: To describe revenue, the column headers are usually: quantity (Q), price (P), total revenue (TR), average revenue (AR), marginal revenue (MR) <!--SR:!2025-06-12,143,423!2025-05-01,101,403-->
- [marginal revenue](../../../../general/marginal%20revenue.md) ::@:: It is a central concept in microeconomics that describes the additional total revenue generated by increasing product sales by 1 unit. <p> $$MR = \frac {\Delta TR} {\Delta Q}$$ <!--SR:!2025-06-15,146,423!2025-06-05,136,423-->
  - average revenue ::@:: $$AR = \frac {TR} Q = P$$ <p> Note it is undefined when quantity is 0. Also, it equaling the equilibrium price is only true if _the firm is in a perfect competitive market_. <!--SR:!2025-06-14,145,423!2025-06-19,150,423-->
  - marginal revenue / __format__: table ::@:: Since marginal revenue compares two different quantities and prices, it is best to move the column (except header) down by 0.5 rows. <!--SR:!2025-06-15,146,423!2025-04-28,105,403-->
- profit maximization
  - profit maximization / marginalism ::@:: If MR > MC, sell more to increase profit. If MR < MC, sell less to increase profit. When MR = MC, profit is maximized. So in a way, (SR)MC is a _firm's (short run) supply curve_ (truncated below the minimum of the (SR)AVC curve). <!--SR:!2025-05-05,105,403!2025-06-03,134,423-->
- [shutdown](../../../../general/shutdown%20(economics).md) ::@:: Technically, it occurs if _average revenue_ is below _average variable cost_ at the _profit-maximizing positive level of output_. Producing anything would not generate enough revenue to offset the associated _variable costs_ (the fixed cost is ignored because it is usually a _sunk cost_); producing some output would add further costs in excess of revenues to the costs inevitably being incurred (the fixed costs). By not producing, the firm _loses only the fixed costs_. (In the long run, _exiting_ (not _shutdown_) the market incurs no costs, not even fixed costs.) <!--SR:!2025-06-20,151,423!2025-04-23,101,403-->
  - shutdown vs. exit ::@:: The former is a short run decision: to not produce anything. The latter is a long run decision: to leave the market. <!--SR:!2025-06-20,151,423!2025-06-07,138,423-->
  - shutdown / graph ::@:: In a _perfectly competitive market_, price equals the marginal revenue at all points. So MR curve is a horizontal line. We shutdown when the MR curve is below the minimum of the SRAVC curve. FC (thus SRATC) is ignored because it is usually a sunk cost. Otherwise, we produce to the quantity where MR = MC. So MR above the minimum of the SRAVC is the _firm's SR supply curve_. <!--SR:!2025-06-19,150,423!2025-04-17,96,403-->
- [break-even point](../../../../general/break-even%20point.md) ::@:: It is the minimum of the SRATC curve. If a flat MR curve intersects at this point, then there is neither economic profit nor economic loss, taking the FC into consideration (considered by SRATC but not SRAVC). <p> Economic profit/loss is the rectangle enclosed by the MR curve, the quantity vertical line, and the corresponding point on the ATC extended into an infinite horizontal line. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,72,383!2025-05-08,108,403-->
- entry & exit ::@::  This assumes the market is _perfectly competitive_, i.e. there are no barriers to entry and exit. <!--SR:!2025-06-17,148,423!2025-06-07,138,423-->
  - exit ::@:: In the long run, all costs are variable. So we only consider TC. So a firm exits if TR < TC ⇒ P < ATC in order to cut losses. This assumes the market is _perfectly competitive_. <!--SR:!2025-06-06,137,423!2025-06-15,146,423-->
  - entry ::@:: In the long run, all costs are variable. So we only consider TC. So a firm enters if TR > TC ⇒ P > ATC in order to make more profit. This assumes the market is _perfectly competitive_. <!--SR:!2025-04-26,105,403!2025-06-20,151,423-->
  - entry & exit / efficiency ::@:: Assuming all firms are the _same_ and the market is _perfectly competitive_. <p> All firms have to produce at the base of the LRATC (efficient scale) in the _long run_. All firms make zero _economic profit_ (but they stay in business due to positive _accounting profit_). This also implies the _long run market supply_ is a horizontal line. <!--SR:!2025-06-03,134,423!2025-06-20,151,423-->
    - entry & exit / efficiency / reason ::@:: Assuming all firms are the _same_ and the market is _perfectly competitive_. <p> If firms make positive economic profit, more firms enter. This increases market supply, so equilibrium price decreases, decreasing MR. Eventually enough firms enter to drive the price to zero economic profit. The reverse happens if firms make negative economic profit. In both cases, the price is eventually driven such that firms make zero economic profit. <!--SR:!2025-06-20,151,423!2025-06-10,140,423-->
    - entry & exit / efficiency / conditions ::@:: The above assumes all firms are the _same_ and costs do not change as firms enter or exit the market. If either of this is not true, the LR supply curve can slope upward. <p> This is because lower cost firms will enter first. As price rises, increasingly higher cost firms will enter. The end result is that the marginal form has zero economic profit while all other lower cost firms have positive economic profit. <p> Alternatively, the upward LR supply curve can be interpreted as that consumers have to pay a higher price to induce more firms to enter the market (to produce). A horizontal curve means consumers do not need to do so. <!--SR:!2025-03-08,60,363!2025-05-05,105,403-->

  - assigned reading: textbook chapter 15
  - assignment: [problem set 11](assignments/problem%20set%2011/submission.md)
- [imperfect competition](../../../../general/imperfect%20competition.md) ::@:: It refers to a situation where the characteristics of an economic market do not fulfil all the necessary conditions of a perfectly competitive market. Imperfect competition causes market inefficiencies, resulting in market failure. <!--SR:!2025-06-18,149,423!2025-03-29,76,383-->
  - imperfect competition / types ::@:: monopoly (e.g. De Beers diamonds), duopoly (e.g. credit cards, soft drinks), oligopoly (e.g. automobiles), monopolistic competition (e.g. hair stylists, restaurants) <!--SR:!2025-05-08,107,403!2025-03-24,72,383-->
- [monopoly](../../../../general/monopoly.md) ::@:: It is the only firm in the market, it faces the whole market demand curve. <p> (Reminder: A competitive firm's demand is perfect elastic (horizontal line at market equilibrium price).) <!--SR:!2025-06-09,140,423!2025-06-18,149,423-->
  - monopoly / effect ::@:: The market demand curve restricts a monopolist. The output effect refers to higher output raising revenue. The price effect refers to higher output leading to lower price, reducing revenue. <!--SR:!2025-06-14,145,423!2025-04-16,95,403-->
  - monopoly / causes ::@:: There likely exists _barriers to entry_. <!--SR:!2025-06-05,136,423!2025-06-04,135,423-->
- [market power](../../../../general/market%20power.md) ::@:: It refers to the ability to raise prices without losing all customers. <p> Perfectly competitive firms face a perfectly elastic (firm) demand curve, so it has no power, hence they are called _price takers_. Otherwise, they are called _price setters_. <!--SR:!2025-03-29,76,383!2025-06-06,137,423-->
- [price discrimination](../../../../general/price%20discrimination.md) ::@:: Monopoly that have (some) information about the WTP of different customers can even charge different prices for different buyers according to their WTP. <!--SR:!2025-06-11,142,423!2025-06-18,149,423-->
- [barriers to entry](../../../../general/barriers%20to%20entry.md) ::@:: Usually, they are: monopoly resources, government regulation, and production process. <!--SR:!2025-04-27,104,403!2025-06-19,150,423-->
  - barriers to entry / monopoly resources ::@:: A key resource for production is owned by a single firm. <p> For example, De Beers owns most of the world's diamond mines. <!--SR:!2025-06-03,134,423!2025-06-09,140,423-->
  - barriers to entry / government regulation ::@:: The government gives a single firm the exclusive right to produce some good or service. (Also see [legal monopoly](../../../../general/legal%20monopoly.md).) <p> Examples include copyright, patents, etc. <!--SR:!2025-05-01,108,403!2025-04-26,103,403-->
    - [legal monopoly](../../../../general/legal%20monopoly.md) ::@:: It is a monopoly that is protected by law from competition. <!--SR:!2025-06-13,144,423!2025-06-19,150,423-->
  - barriers to entry / production process ::@:: A single firm can produce output at a lower cost than can a larger number of producers. This may happen if FC is high but MC is low. (Also see [natural monopoly](../../../../general/natural%20monopoly.md).) <p> Examples include electricity, or industries with a decreasing or flat ATC curve for a wide range of output level. (Forever decreasing ATC may be rare...) <!--SR:!2025-06-11,142,423!2025-03-26,73,383-->
    - [natural monopoly](../../../../general/natural%20monopoly.md) ::@:: It is is a monopoly in an industry in which high infrastructural costs and other barriers to entry relative to the size of the market give the largest supplier in an industry, often the first supplier in a market, an overwhelming advantage over potential competitors. Specifically, an industry is a natural monopoly if the total cost of one firm, producing the total output, is lower than the total cost of two or more firms producing the entire production. <!--SR:!2025-05-11,111,403!2025-04-18,97,403-->
- [monopoly](../../../../general/monopoly.md)
  - monopoly / marginal revenue ::@:: The MR for a monopoly is negatively sloping, and slopes more than the market demand curve (in fact, twice the absolute slope). It can even be negative. This is because increasing output increases MR by selling more, but decreases MR because previously sold units have to be sold at a reduced price, following the market demand curve. (This assumes the firm cannot practice _price discrimination_...) <p> Mathematically, differentiate the TR equation. <!--SR:!2025-04-30,107,403!2025-04-28,105,403-->
  - monopoly / __format__: table ::@:: When calculating MR in a table, remember to add the price column as well, since the price is controllable for a monopoly! <!--SR:!2025-06-07,138,423!2025-06-04,134,423-->
  - monopoly / profit maximization ::@:: We still follow MR = MC. But the intersection of MR = MC is different than that in a perfectly competitive market. Also, the price P needs to be found after calculating the quantity first, instead of the other way around. <p> Also, MR is not necessarily the equilibrium price P. In fact, there is no supply curve for a monopoly, since the monopolist is not faced with any price: changing the output affects the price. So there is not even an equilibrium price. <!--SR:!2025-04-01,79,383!2025-06-11,142,423-->
    - monopoly / profit maximization / demand elasticity ::@:: Assume the demand curve is linear. MR = 0 at the point where demand elasticity of the is exactly 1 (remember the definition of demand elasticity). This is the quantity produced if MC = 0. If MC > 0, then less will be produced, so the demand curve at said quantity is elastic. <!--SR:!2025-06-04,135,423!2025-05-01,108,403-->
  - monopoly / equation ::@:: $$\begin{aligned} P & = a - bQ \\ TR & = P \times Q = aQ - bQ^2 \\ MR & = TR' = a - 2bQ \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-06-20,151,423!2025-04-25,102,403-->
  - monopoly / deadweight loss ::@:: Since the MR curve meets the MC curve at a quantity less than the quantity where the MC curve meets the demand curve (the competitive equilibrium quantity), so there will be deadweight loss. <p> The consumers are obviously unhappy. The monopolist is okay, because the consumer surplus transferred to the producer surplus exceeds the producer surplus loss from the deadweight loss. This is a type of _rent-seeking_: increase in the monopolist's surplus without increasing total surplus. <!--SR:!2025-04-29,106,403!2025-05-05,105,403-->
    - [rent-seeking](../../../../general/rent-seeking.md) ::@:: It is the act of growing one's existing wealth by manipulating the social or political environment without creating new wealth. <!--SR:!2025-06-19,149,423!2025-06-18,149,423-->
- [price discrimination](../../../../general/price%20discrimination.md) ::@:: It is a microeconomic pricing strategy where identical or largely similar goods or services are sold at different prices by the same provider to different buyers based on which market segment they are perceived to be part of. <!--SR:!2025-06-10,140,423!2025-05-07,107,403-->
  - price discrimination / classification ::@:: personalized pricing (first-degree price differentiation), product versioning (second-degree price differentiation), group pricing (third-degree price differentiation) <!--SR:!2025-06-14,144,423!2025-06-16,147,423-->
  - perfect price discrimination ::@:: It is selling to each customer at a different price; this is also called one-to-one marketing. The optimal incarnation of this is called "perfect price discrimination" and maximizes the price that each customer is willing to pay. As such, in "first degree" price differentiation the entire consumer surplus is captured for each individual. <!--SR:!2025-06-12,143,423!2025-06-19,150,423-->
    - perfect price discrimination / conditions ::@:: It requires a monopolist to know all buyers' WTP. Also no resale of goods between different buyers (arbitrage). So in practice, it is very difficult. <!--SR:!2025-04-23,101,403!2025-06-04,135,423-->
    - perfect price discrimination / graph ::@:: The demand curve becomes the MR curve. The quantity produced is the same as the competitive equilibrium quantity again, so deadweight loss is eliminated. But producer surplus captures all surplus, and there is no consumer surplus. <!--SR:!2025-05-05,113,403!2025-05-01,108,403-->
  - group pricing ::@:: age-based discounts, coupons (raise prices without affecting low-income groups, since low-income groups collect coupons, while high-income groups find it not worth the time), different prices in different countries (due to different income levels), financial aid for low income family by universities and colleges, premium airline tickets (e.g. business class) <!--SR:!2025-03-27,74,383!2025-03-31,77,383-->
  - price discrimination / non-examples ::@:: Price differences that arise from cost differences, e.g. peak-hour price for transportation: more workers to maintain the services; VIP room in restaurants: better services and decorations. <!--SR:!2025-05-03,103,403!2025-05-10,110,403-->

  - long lines, sellers' personal preference (-1, MCQ) ::@:: Long lines (queuing for a good) are inefficient because they waste buyers' time, not because buyers who want the good most may not get the good — buyers who want the good most use the most time waiting for the good, while those who are not may give up waiting. It is only selling according to sellers' personal preference where the latter happens. <!--SR:!2025-05-16,140,412!2025-05-18,142,412-->
  - reasonable assumptions: tax on gasoline, deadweight loss (0, MCQ) ::@:: There was a question about tax on gasoline and deadweight loss. One of the options is the deadweight loss must decrease when the tax decreases. If the supply curve were completely inelastic, this would have not been true. However, since we are talking about gasoline, the supply curve is _assumed_ to be not completely inelastic, so the above is true. <p> In general, some _reasonable_ assumptions and _common sense_ are required to answer the questions. Indeed, there are many more _reasonable_ assumptions made above to answer such a question, e.g. the law of demand, the law of supply, etc. <!--SR:!2025-03-02,71,372!2025-04-08,102,392-->
  - descriptive, normative (-1, MCQ) ::@:: Economist A thinks taxing consumption but not saving increases saving. Economist B thinks taxing consumption or saving does not affect much. <p> In this case, they disagree about the validity of a descriptive statement: taxing consumption but not saving increases saving. And this disagreement itself is also normative. <!--SR:!2025-05-03,129,412!2025-05-14,138,412-->
  - Why do economists make assumptions? (-1, MCQ) ::@:: It is to focus on relevant factors and make the real world easier to understand; but not for making it easier to teach economics (I still disagree with this being false...) or making alternative policies that are incomplete to be criticized. <!--SR:!2025-03-27,96,392!2025-05-15,139,412-->
  - banning ticket scalping (0, MCQ) ::@:: The question asked about which of the following is a _non_-effect of banning ticket scalping: decrease length of lines (length of queuing for tickets; maps to quantity demanded), decrease audience (number of people who actually gets the ticket; maps to quantity supplied), increase ticket prices, or decrease tax revenue. <p> The answer was decrease lines. But increase ticket prices does not make sense either. The instructor was also confused, and suggested that it may had been caused by incomplete modification of past paper questions. <!--SR:!2025-04-02,102,392!2025-03-26,91,392-->

- [monopoly](../../../../general/monopoly.md)
  - monopoly / regulation ::@:: do nothing, regulate pricing (price ceiling), regulate by ownership (government-owned) <!--SR:!2025-06-19,150,423!2025-06-15,146,423-->
    - monopoly / regulation / motivations ::@:: to prevent monopoly from extending its monopoly power to other goods, to prevent monopoly appearance to promote competitions <!--SR:!2025-04-29,106,403!2025-06-14,145,423-->
    - monopoly / regulation / examples ::@:: Anti-competition laws would likely have blocked the merge of Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Antitrust laws make Microsoft cannot pre-install Internet Explorer (IE) with Windows products. <!--SR:!2025-06-14,145,423!2025-06-04,135,423-->
    - monopoly / regulation / difficulties ::@:: Merge may lower production cost for efficiency. But it may make a monopoly which leads to inefficiency. It is hard to balance the benefits and costs. There will be disagreements between firms and governments, and resolving this by court is costly. <!--SR:!2025-05-02,102,403!2025-03-26,74,383-->
    - monopoly / regulation / regulate pricing ::@:: Lower price and push quantity produced towards the competitive equilibrium quantity. Pricing cannot exceed certain level according to certain measurements: Usually on monopoly's profitability, such as return of capital/equity. Two main methods exist: MC pricing and AC pricing. <!--SR:!2025-05-09,108,403!2025-04-01,78,383-->
      - monopoly / regulation / regulate pricing / MC pricing ::@:: Assume MC curve is lower than the ATC curve. <p> If the price is regulated to be the marginal cost, then the monopolist will produce the competitive equilibrium quantity, but at an economic loss. The government would probably subsidy the loss. <!--SR:!2025-03-29,76,383!2025-06-15,146,423-->
      - monopoly / regulation / regulate pricing / AC pricing ::@:: Assume MC curve is lower than the ATC curve. <p> If the price is regulated such that the monopolist makes zero economic profit, then the monopolist will produce more than the profit maximizing quantity but less than the competitive equilibrium quantity. Thus there is still deadweight loss, but less than unregulated. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,72,383!2025-05-04,104,403-->
    - monopoly / regulation / regulate by ownership ::@:: The government owns the monopolist. So profit is no longer the only objective, and there are other objectives. <p> But many cases shown that inefficiency, including expensive (ironically), less varieties, poor quality, would be the likely outcome... <!--SR:!2025-06-08,139,423!2025-06-15,146,423-->
    - monopoly / regulation / do nothing ::@:: In the spirit of the Chicago School tradition, cost from regulating monopoly is larger than the inefficiency due to lacking competition. <p> Further, firms will try to do price discrimination (perfect would lead to zero deadweight loss), and this tends to move the quantity to the competitive equilibrium quantity, reducing deadweight loss (though the splitting of total surplus may not be "fair"). <!--SR:!2025-06-06,137,423!2025-06-07,138,423-->

  - assignment: [problem set 12](assignments/problem%20set%2012/submission.md)
- [oligopoly](../../../../general/oligopoly.md) ::@:: It is a market in which pricing control lies in the hands of a few sellers. <p> In such a situation, _strategic behaviors_ arise: A firm's decisions (for example, on P or Q) depend on other firms' decisions. _Game theory_ may be used to study this. <!--SR:!2025-06-13,144,423!2025-04-24,102,403-->
  - oligopoly / strategic interaction ::@:: In a monopoly, there is no one else to interact. In a perfectly competitive market, you will not care about what others are doing. You only care about the equilibrium market price. <p> So this is why such interaction arises in duopoly or oligopoly only. <!--SR:!2025-06-18,149,423!2025-04-16,95,403-->
- [game theory](../../../../general/game%20theory.md) ::@:: It is the study of [mathematical models](../../../../general/mathematical%20model.md) of strategic interactions. <p> It studies players (decision makers), strategies (players' complete plan of actions), and payoffs (outcomes, which can be rewards or punishments). Usually there are two players, but any number of players can be analyzed. <!--SR:!2025-06-06,136,423!2025-06-07,138,423-->
  - game theory / strategy ::@:: A plan of action that describes what a player will do "in every circumstance" that can observe. <!--SR:!2025-06-20,151,423!2025-06-06,137,423-->
- [battle of the sexes](../../../../general/battle%20of%20the%20sexes%20(game%20theory).md) ::@:: Imagine that a man and a woman hope to meet this evening, but have a choice between two events to attend: a prize fight and a ballet. The man would prefer to go to prize fight. The woman would prefer the ballet. Both would prefer to go to the same event rather than different ones. If they cannot communicate, where should they go? <!--SR:!2025-06-08,139,423!2025-06-16,147,423-->
  - battle of the sexes / relation to business ::@:: It is a game-theory model of coordination in business. <!--SR:!2025-06-20,151,423!2025-04-28,107,403-->
- [Nash equilibrium](../../../../general/Nash%20equilibrium.md) ::@:: In [game theory](../../../../general/game%20theory.md), it is the most commonly-used [solution concept](../../../../general/solution%20concept.md) for [non-cooperative games](../../../../general/non-cooperative%20game%20theory.md). It is a situation where no player could gain by changing their own strategy \(holding all other players' strategies fixed\). <p> If each player has chosen a [strategy](../../../../general/strategy%20(game%20theory).md) – an action plan based on what has happened so far in the game – and no one can increase one's own expected payoff by changing one's strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices constitutes this. <p> Note that the strategy may be pure (one could also considered pure as a degenerate form of mixed) or mixed. <!--SR:!2025-04-30,107,403!2025-06-11,141,423-->
- [strategy](../../../../general/strategy%20(game%20theory).md)
  - [strategy](../../../../general/strategy%20(game%20theory).md) / pure strategy ::@:: It means a strategy where the player must play a particular strategy from their strategy set. <!--SR:!2025-04-29,106,403!2025-05-12,112,403-->
  - [strategy](../../../../general/strategy%20(game%20theory).md) / mixed strategy ::@:: It means a strategy where the player plays a strategy in their strategy set with a probability. Pure strategy can be treated as a degenerate form of mixed strategy, where one strategy is assigned the probability of 1 and the rest assigned 0. <p> In this context, the payoff may be called _expected payoff_ instead. <!--SR:!2025-03-29,76,383!2025-06-12,143,423-->
- [prisoners' dilemma](../../../../general/prisoners'%20dilemma.md) ::@:: It is a [game theory](../../../../general/game%20theory.md) thought experiment involving two [rational agents](../../../../general/rational%20agent.md), each of whom can either cooperate for mutual benefit or betray their partner \("defect"\) for individual gain. The dilemma arises from the fact that while defecting is rational for each agent, cooperation yields a higher payoff for each. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,72,383!2025-04-17,96,403-->
  - prisoners' dilemma / relation to business ::@:: It illustrates how difficult it is for competing firms to cooperate with each other. <p> Whatever they have agreed to, each player can do better by cheating (following self-interest). <!--SR:!2025-06-15,146,423!2025-06-05,136,423-->
- [strategy](../../../../general/strategy%20(game%20theory).md)
  - [strategic dominance](../../../../general/strategic%20dominance.md) ::@:: In [game theory](../../../../general/game%20theory.md), it is a [strategy](../../../../general/strategy%20(game%20theory).md) that is better than any other strategy for a player, no matter how that player's opponent or opponents play. Strategies that are dominated by another strategy can be eliminated from consideration, as they can be strictly improved upon. Some very simple games can be solved using dominance. <p> For example, in prisoners' dilemma, defecting is the dominant strategy. So rational players would both defect. <!--SR:!2025-06-19,150,423!2025-04-26,103,403-->

- oligopoly
  - oligopoly / duopoly models ::@:: Bertrand duopoly: two firms compete by choosing prices; Cournot duopoly: two firms compete by choosing quantities (we only learn the latter) <!--SR:!2025-05-06,106,403!2025-06-09,140,423-->
  - oligopoly / collusion ::@:: In a oligopoly, all firms may collude and act as one, like a monopolist. Then the profits are divided. <p> The problem is a firm may cheat and gain more profit for itself, so this is not a Nash equilibrium. Indeed, the Nash equilibrium would not be the monopoly price and quantity, but moved a bit towards the equilibrium price and quantity (but not completely). This movement increases with the number of firms in the oligopoly.. <p> (One can see if there are many firms, the resulting price and quantity would be arbitrarily close to the equilibrium price and quantity...) <!--SR:!2025-05-01,100,403!2025-04-02,79,383-->
- [Cournot competition](../../../../general/Cournot%20competition.md) ::@:: It is an economic model used to describe an industry structure in which companies compete on the amount of output they will produce, which they decide on independently of each other and at the same time. <!--SR:!2025-03-27,75,383!2025-06-13,144,423-->

- [Cournot competition](../../../../general/Cournot%20competition.md)
  - Cournot duopoly
    - Cournot duopoly / method ::@:: Let two firms produced quantities be q1, q2. Find the _best response_ function for each firm by fixing the other firm's quantity, find TR, MR (differentiate TR), and set MR = MC. You should obtain two best response functions. The q1's function is in terms of q2's quantity, while q2's function is in terms of q1's quantity. Solve for q1\* and q2\* by setting q1 = q1\*, q2 = q2\*. <p> You should probably also plot the best response functions on the graph (make sure the axis is correct) and find their intersection, which should be the same as the q1\*, q2\* found above. <!--SR:!2025-05-06,106,403!2025-06-16,147,423-->
  - Cournot competition / Nash equilibrium ::@:: If a solution exist to all of the above best response functions, it is a Nash equilibrium. For each firm, given other firms' outputs are fixed, the best response functions give the best response to maximize its own profit by definition, so it has no incentive to change. Thus, it is a Nash equilibrium. <!--SR:!2025-05-02,110,403!2025-06-17,148,423-->
  - Cournot competition / efficiency ::@:: The resulting equilibrium is not efficient. That is, it is not the competitive equilibrium. But it is closer to the competitive equilibrium than the monopoly one. This means there is still deadweight loss, though not as large as in monopoly. <p> As the number of firms increase, it gets closer to the competitive equilibrium (if there are _n_ firms, the equilibrium is _n_/(_n_ + 1) of the competitive equilibrium quantity). So a very large number of Cournot competitors behave like perfect competitors and are almost efficient. <!--SR:!2025-06-14,145,423!2025-04-02,79,383-->
- [Bertrand competition](../../../../general/Bertrand%20competition.md) (untaught) ::@:: (untaught) It describes interactions among firms (sellers) that set prices and their customers (buyers) that choose quantities at the prices set. <!--SR:!2025-05-03,111,403!2025-06-07,138,423-->
- oligopoly
  - oligopoly / collusion
    - oligopoly / collusion / game theory ::@:: Actually this is similar to prisoners' dilemma. Draw a payoff table and see it is very familiar... (Extension: Draw a table with more than 2 choices for each firm.) <p> The fact that the equilibrium is to renegade is bad for oligopoly firms: they cannot achieve monopoly profits; but this is good for the society: the quantity produced is closer to the competitive equilibrium quantity. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,72,383!2025-06-13,144,423-->
- [cooperative game theory](../../../../general/cooperative%20game%20theory.md) ::@:: The above games we have described assume players cannot cooperate. However, this seems to violate our observations that "cooperation" is possible... <p> The hint is that, in the real world, such "games" are played over and over again. This is called a _repeated game_: A game that is repeated among the same players for many times, so long-term relationships are valuable. In repeated games, cooperations are more likely to occur. <!--SR:!2025-04-16,95,403!2025-04-18,97,403-->
  - [tit for tat](../../../../general/tit%20for%20tat.md) ::@:: It is an English saying meaning "equivalent retaliation". <p> In game theory, it means you play the cooperative strategy in the first round (try to reach the cooperative equilibrium). In the following rounds, if the other player cooperates/cheats in the previous round, you cooperate/cheat, copying the other player's strategy in previous round (punishment for cheating). <!--SR:!2025-05-11,111,403!2025-04-27,104,403-->

  - assignment: [problem set 13](assignments/problem%20set%2013/submission.md)
- [externality](../../../../general/externality.md) ::@:: It is an indirect cost or benefit to an uninvolved third party that arises as an effect of another party's (or parties') activity. Externalities can be considered as unpriced components that are involved in either consumer or producer market transactions. <p> A positive externality is when an individual's consumption in a market increases the well-being of others, but the individual does not charge the third party for the benefit. A negative externality is defined analogously. <!--SR:!2025-06-05,136,423!2025-06-19,150,423-->
  - externality / effect ::@:: It is one major factors that causes a free-market to fail to maximize social surplus. We call this _market failure_. <p> The reason is because that when deciding "how much to do", people is not required/lack the incentive" to consider the externalities those activities create. People only concern their "private cost and benefit". <!--SR:!2025-06-11,142,423!2025-03-28,75,383-->
  - externality / examples ::@:: Those who have promotion activities at the atrium do not bear the _external costs_ on others (annoyance, lost productivity). A self-disciplined student studying hard causing others to study do not gain the _external benefits_ on others (others studying to learn more). <p> From a society perspective, these external costs and benefits should be considered. <!--SR:!2025-06-19,150,423!2025-06-13,144,423-->
  - externality / internalization ::@:: This makes people to consider externalities. Examples include subsidies (to promote positive externalities) and tax (to reduce negative externalities). This induces people to act "as if" they are "held responsible" for the externalities that they create. <!--SR:!2025-06-05,136,423!2025-06-12,143,423-->
    - externality / internalization / examples ::@:: Schools could pay (subsidize) students to study. Taxes on cigarettes could be set to include the costs of illness created by second-hand smoke. <!--SR:!2025-06-07,138,423!2025-04-16,95,403-->
    - externality / internalization / mechanism ::@:: The original supply curve and demand curve respectively show the _private cost_ and _private value_. By adding the externalities, we can obtain the supply curves and demand curves leading to the social equilibrium. <p> Taxes and subsidies may be applied to move the curves to the social equilibrium. Or consider applying _Coase theorem_... <!--SR:!2025-05-03,103,403!2025-05-11,111,403-->
- How clean is "clean"? ::@:: Is there something called "completely clean"? Turns out it is impossible. Instead, it is a tradeoff: you clean, but you clean up to the point where you are _satisfied_ with the cleanness. The same may be applied for pollution and many other things... <p> Actually the above can be described economically: Consider "you will stop cleaning when you are _satisfied_ with the cleanness". You can associate cleaning with a cost, and cleanness with a benefit. When the marginal cost equals marginal benefit, then you are _satisfied_. It works like in a free market! The same can be applied for other situation. This is where the Coase theorem comes in. <!--SR:!2025-06-16,147,423!2025-06-14,145,423-->
- [Coase theorem](../../../../general/Coase%20theorem.md) ::@:: It states that if the provision of a good or service results in an externality and trade in that good or service is possible, then bargaining will lead to a Pareto efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property. A key condition for this outcome is that there are _sufficiently low transaction costs_ in the bargaining and exchange process. <!--SR:!2025-06-18,149,423!2025-04-25,103,403-->
  - Coase theorem / named after ::@:: Ronald Harry Coase was a law professor at the University of Chicago. <!--SR:!2025-05-02,102,403!2025-06-13,144,423-->
  - Coase theorem / example ::@:: An economist steeps into an elevator and noticed that a young girl is smoking. If there is no legal restriction, what can economist do? The economist can offer her \$10 to put it out. <!--SR:!2025-06-05,136,423!2025-06-07,137,423-->
  - Coase theorem / mechanism ::@:: Externalities would often be internalized by negotiation between the private parties affected. By private negotiation (market), "externalities" could be "internalized", efficient outcome can be reached (inefficiency solved). <p> In a way, this can be interpreted as that externalities cause market failure because of "not clearly defined" private property right: no one "owns" the externalities. Defining ownership clearly solves this, and this is the key. <!--SR:!2025-06-18,149,423!2025-06-12,143,423-->
  - Coase theorem / invariance ::@:: Regardless of the initial allocation of property/rights, the same efficient outcome will prevail. But the wealth distribution may be different. (In the examples above, cash flow direction would be reversed.) <p> For example, if it is more efficient to prevent cattle trampling a farmer's fields by fencing in the farm, rather than fencing in the cattle, the outcome of bargaining will be the fence around the farmer's fields, regardless of whether _victim rights_ or _unrestricted grazing-rights_ prevail. <p> (Note: Subsequent authors have shown that invariance is not generally true, however. Changing liability placement changes wealth distribution, which in turn affects demand and prices. But ignore this for the exams...) <!--SR:!2025-03-07,59,363!2025-06-14,145,423-->
  - Coase theorem / limitations ::@:: It does not work very well when the costs of reaching agreements are high, such as externalities being produced by many people or firms, or if the legal costs for reaching or enforcing agreements are high. <br/> A particular example is global warming. <!--SR:!2025-06-17,148,423!2025-06-09,140,423-->
- [carbon emission trading](../../../../general/carbon%20emission%20trading.md) ::@:: It is a type of emissions trading scheme designed for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and other greenhouse gases (GHGs). <p> This is an application of Coase theorem. <!--SR:!2025-06-14,145,423!2025-05-01,101,403-->
  - carbon emission trading / mechanism ::@:: The government sets a target for carbon emission. The government sells permits, which can be traded among firms, to emit according to its target. Then it auctions off the permits to firms. The government can earn more revenue, while using market mechanism to ensure that the permits are in firms who value them the most (highest WTP). This ensures economic efficiency: Activities that still create economic gain if emissions are considered will continue. Or investment on carbon reduction will increase if it is cheaper than buying permits. Changing market conditions and environment, which may change WTP, reallocates the permits through the market. <p> This, of course, assumes enforcement is perfect... And there are also other (not necessarily economic) problems not mentioned here. <!--SR:!2025-06-15,145,423!2025-04-17,96,403-->

  - assignment: [problem set 13](assignments/problem%20set%2013/submission.md)
- [public good](../../../../general/public%20good%20(economics).md) ::@:: It is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Use by one person neither prevents access by other people, nor does it reduce availability to others. Therefore, the good can be used simultaneously by more than one person. <p> A public good must be valuable to more than one user, otherwise, its simultaneous availability to more than one person would be economically irrelevant. <!--SR:!2025-06-16,147,423!2025-03-31,77,383-->
  - public good / motivation ::@:: There are goods and services that cannot be efficiently provided in private markets, such as clean streets, disease control, and law enforcement (police). <!--SR:!2025-06-06,137,423!2025-06-08,139,423-->
- [excludability](../../../../general/excludability.md) ::@:: It is the degree to which a good, service or resource can be limited to only paying customers, or conversely, the degree to which a supplier, producer or other managing body (e.g. a government) can prevent consumption of a good. <!--SR:!2025-04-18,97,403!2025-03-27,75,383-->
- [rivalry](../../../../general/rivalry%20(economics).md) ::@:: A good is said to be rivalrous or a rival if its consumption by one consumer prevents simultaneous consumption by other consumers, or if consumption by one party reduces the ability of another party to consume it. <p> A good is considered non-rivalrous or non-rival if, for any level of production, the cost of providing it to a marginal (additional) individual is zero. <p> A good is "anti-rivalrous" and "inclusive" if each person benefits more when other people consume it. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,72,383!2025-06-12,143,423-->
- [public good](../../../../general/public%20good%20(economics).md)
  - public good / examples ::@:: national defense, tornado siren, uncongested non-toll roads, etc. <!--SR:!2025-06-06,137,423!2025-06-10,141,423-->
  - public good / aggregate demand curve ::@:: For private goods, we add the individual demand curves horizontally. That is, for each price, the quantities are added. <p> For public goods, the reverse happens: we add the individual demand curves vertically. That is, for each quantity, the prices are added. This is because a quantity of public good can be used by many individuals at the same time. <p> The efficient output is still given by MB = MC. <!--SR:!2025-05-02,101,403!2025-05-07,107,403-->
- [common good](../../../../general/common%20good%20(economics).md) ::@:: They are defined in economics as goods that are rivalrous and non-excludable. <p> Examples include congested non-toll roads, the environment, ocean fish, etc. <!--SR:!2025-06-16,146,423!2025-05-07,107,403-->
  - public good vs. common good ::@:: This is in contrast to a common good, such as wild fish stocks in the ocean, which is non-excludable but rivalrous to a certain degree. If too many fish were harvested, the stocks would deplete, limiting the access of fish for others. <!--SR:!2025-06-15,146,423!2025-05-09,109,403-->
- [private good](../../../../general/private%20good.md) ::@:: It is defined in economics as "an item that yields positive benefits to people" that is excludable, i.e. its owners can exercise private property rights, preventing those who have not paid for it from using the good or consuming its benefits; and rivalrous, i.e. consumption by one necessarily prevents that of another. <p> Examples include clothing, congested toll roads, ice-cream cones, etc. <!--SR:!2025-06-21,151,423!2025-06-05,135,423-->
- [club good](../../../../general/club%20good.md) ::@:: They are a type of good in economics, sometimes classified as a subtype of public goods that are excludable but non-rivalrous, at least until reaching a point where congestion occurs. Often these goods exhibit high excludability, but at the same time low rivalry in consumption. <p> Examples include cable TV, fire protection, uncongested toll roads, etc. <!--SR:!2025-05-05,105,403!2025-05-04,104,403-->

  - excludability / problem ::@:: If a good or service is non-excludable, consumers can obtain it without payment. If they do so, then they are _free riders_. <!--SR:!2025-06-11,142,423!2025-06-20,151,423-->
- [free-rider problem](../../../../general/free-rider%20problem.md) ::@:: It a type of market failure that occurs when those who benefit from resources, public goods and common pool resources do not pay for them or under-pay. Examples of such goods are public roads or public libraries or other services or utilities of a communal nature. <!--SR:!2025-06-11,142,423!2025-03-29,76,383-->
- [Samaritan's dilemma](../../../../general/Samaritan's%20dilemma.md) ::@:: It hinges on the idea that when presented with charity, in some locations such as a soup kitchen, a person will act in one of two ways: using the charity to improve their situation, or coming to rely on charity as a means of survival. <p> Should we be charitable when charity creates bad incentives? <!--SR:!2025-05-05,105,403!2025-06-05,136,423-->
  - Samaritan's dilemma ::@:: Should national medical insurance cover people who are not paying? If no, people who could neither afford treatment nor insurance would be harmed (high private and social cost). If yes, then why should any of us pay national medical insurance, since we will be compensated anyway? <p> Note in this case, national medical insurance is non-excludable, but it is rivalrous. <!--SR:!2025-06-20,151,423!2025-06-19,150,423-->
- [rivalry](../../../../general/rivalry%20(economics).md)
  - rivalary vs. scarcity ::@:: The latter refers to the opportunity cost of creating a good or services. The former refers to the use or consumption of a scarce good or service. <p> If a good or service is non-rivalrous, its use or consumption does not add to the scarcity. <!--SR:!2025-04-21,99,403!2025-06-19,150,423-->
  - rivalary / problem ::@:: For a non-rivalrous good, it is economically inefficient to exclude it. Excluded people who want to use the good adds a lot of deadweight loss. But not excluding it means people will not pay for it. <p> So this is why government provides many non-rivalrous goods (including public goods), regardless if exclusion is possible. Examples include basic scientific research, radio, television, weather forecasting, etc. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,71,383!2025-05-06,106,403-->
- [public good](../../../../general/public%20good%20(economics).md)
  - public good / government ::@:: They are often provided by the governments. Private firms can hardly provide them because it will be money losing due to free riders. But the government collect taxes, so this solves the free rider problem while not excluding the public good to ensure maximum economic efficiency. <!--SR:!2025-06-08,139,423!2025-05-03,103,403-->
  - public good / use ::@:: Because they are not excludable, the free-market quantity is zero, so it is less than the efficient quantity. This can be interpreted as that they are underused because individuals do not feel the positive externalities. <!--SR:!2025-05-08,108,403!2025-06-04,135,423-->
- [common good](../../../../general/common%20good%20(economics).md)
  - common good / use ::@:: The use of them tends to be excessive and inefficient because individuals are not required to bear/pay their opportunity cost. (Also see [tragedy of the commons](../../../../general/tragedy%20of%20the%20commons.md).) <!--SR:!2025-06-14,145,423!2025-06-09,139,423-->
    - [tragedy of the commons](../../../../general/tragedy%20of%20the%20commons.md) ::@:: It is a concept which states that if many people enjoy unfettered access to a finite, valuable resource, such as a pasture, they will tend to overuse it and may end up destroying its value altogether. Even if some users exercised voluntary restraint, the other users would merely replace them, the predictable result being a "tragedy" for all. <!--SR:!2025-05-12,112,403!2025-03-28,75,383-->
    - common good / use / example ::@:: Grand Banks of Newfoundland was very rich in cod fish. But due to overfishing, the fishery of cod collapsed. <p> If it could be owned (which is not, due to its non-excludability), the private owner would exclude it and avoid the fishery collapse. (Also see the example below.) <!--SR:!2025-03-07,59,363!2025-03-27,79,383-->
      - Given both cows and elephants have commercial value, why is elephant but not cow facing extinction? ::@:: This is because cow is a private good, but elephant is a common good. This shows the _importance of property right_. <!--SR:!2025-06-17,148,423!2025-06-12,143,423-->
- [public good](../../../../general/public%20good%20(economics).md)
  - public good / summary ::@:: Markets work best for private goods, which are excludable and rival in consumption. Therefore, these goods are commonly provided by government, using cost-benefit analysis to determine how much to provide (though accurately estimating the cost and benefit may not be easy). <!--SR:!2025-03-29,76,383!2025-04-02,79,383-->
- [common good](../../../../general/common%20good%20(economics).md)
  - common good / summary ::@:: People use these resources without paying, so they tend to overuse them. Therefore, governments try to limit the use of common resources. But also consider this: Instead of "government regulation", according to the Coase Theorem, property right should be better defined (if possible). <!--SR:!2025-06-17,148,423!2025-06-10,141,423-->

- report
  - examination format ::@:: All the questions require you to write a lot of text, and it feels more like writing essays... I was not quite sure the things I have written are what the teacher wants. <p> Next time, I should also check the examination format of each instructor and see if it suits me. <!--SR:!2025-06-23,151,431!2025-01-24,28,411-->
    - examination format / solution ::@:: Turns out their official solutions are very short. A 12-point question has two or three bullet points, each with a sentence... But everyone is writing essays...
  - time limit ::@:: The time limit was barely enough to finish all questions because I had written many words, and had spent some time on thinking... <!--SR:!2025-06-22,150,431!2025-01-24,28,411-->
  - Q2: single-priced monopoly (−6, short question)
    - Q2: single-priced monopoly / Must it be inefficient? (−6) ::@:: No. It is efficient if the demand curve is completely elastic. (Though this means no matter how high the price the monopolist sets to, it is efficient...) <p> An unintended answer, since the question has not specified if regulations are in place, is that there is regulation that forces the monopolist to use marginal cost pricing. In this case, it is also efficient. <!--SR:!2025-02-02,27,417!2025-02-02,27,417-->
  - Q3: sports facility entrance fee (−4, short question)
    - Q3: sports facility entrance fee / Should the operator charge an entrance fee if there are _operating_ costs associated with it? (−4) ::@:: Yes, the operator should charge at the marginal operating cost. <p> I thought the question was talking about fixed costs instead of variable costs when it mentioned _operating_ costs. <!--SR:!2025-02-01,26,417!2025-02-02,27,417-->
