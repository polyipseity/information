## week 1 lecture

- time: 2024-09-02T16:30:00+08:00/2024-09-02T17:50:00+08:00
- a core question of microeconomics ::: What do you WANT?
- course logistics
  - course intended learning outcomes (CILOs) ::: microeconomic analysis, decision making, demand-supply framework, market mechanism in different market structures, economic effect of the government, application
  - objectives ::: to analyze situations through the lens of microeconomics, but not memorization (Of course, some is still required...); a "way of economic thinking" should be developed on your own at the end
- strength and weaknesses of economics ::: It can explain how rational individuals make choice under constraints. But it cannot explain how a group of people (the society) evolve over a long period time; instead, these are studied by history, psychology, sociology, etc.
- quirks about the professor ::: He does not follow the textbook strictly to deepen your thinking (good), makes exam questions based on current issues (cool), and does not care about attendance (good).
- discussions
  - discussions / face mask ::: Should the government intervene in the (previously sky-high) selling price of face masks? This is known as [price control](price%20controls.md).
  - discussions / waste charing scheme ::: Should the government charge waste generation and how? What problems may arise?
  - discussions / more inductive questions ::: high property prices, poverty reduction, education subsidy, China–US trade war, market/free economy vs. planned economy vs. others, etc.

  - assignment: [problem set 1](assignments/problem%20set%201/submission.md)
- way of economic thinking ::: Analyze people's choice under constraints. We assume that people maximize the utility (e.g. happiness) of their choice. We also assume that people have constraints (e.g. budget), or otherwise there is no need to make choices — just choose everything!
  - way of economic thinking / motivation ::: We receive much information from the world everyday, then we interpret it and make predictions based on it. Different people interprets and predicts differently. Whoever make the best prediction based on their interpretation will be the winners. The "way of economic thinking" can help with making better interpretations and hence predictions.
- 10 principles of economics ::: These are some fundamentals principles of economics. Okay, these 10 principles is more of a pedagogical (teaching) tool to introduce us to economics...
  - 10 principles of economics / (1) scarcity (people face trade-offs) ::: Why do people face trade-offs? Because people are short of "something"! Thinking about how to spend your time? You are short of time. Why do you need to pay for "something"? Because there is not enough of "something" to satisfy everyone. This is known as __scarcity__, which depends on _both_ "availability" (supply) and "want" (demand).
    - [scarcity](../../../../general/scarcity.md)
      - [§ scarcity](../../../../general/scarcity.md#scarcity)
      - [§ concept](../../../../general/scarcity.md#concept)
      - [§ scarce goods](../../../../general/scarcity.md#scarce%20goods)
      - [§ nonscarce goods](../../../../general/scarcity.md#nonscarce%20goods)
  - 10 principles of economics / (2) opportunity cost (choices and opportunity cost) ::: __Opportunity cost__ is the "cost" we usually talk about in economics. It is the the value of the best alternative forgone (this includes the _explicit cost_ of the selected choice), given that you have to make a choice. There is __explicit opportunity cost__, which is opportunity cost that requires either a cash transaction or a physical transfer of resources, and thus is easily identifiable. But there is also __implicit opportunity cost__, which is opportunity cost that involves neither a cash transaction nor a physical transfer of resources.
    - 10 principles of economics / opportunity cost / definitions ::: __Economic cost__ is sometimes used in place of _opportunity cost_, but it can also refer to _the sum of accounting cost and opportunity cost_. Opportunity cost may _rarely_ only refer to _implicit opportunity cost_. In this course, __opportunity cost__ includes _both_ explicit and implicit opportunity cost.
    - 10 principles of economics / opportunity cost / choice ::: If there is no choice to be made, either because there is _one and only one available option_ (e.g. food, sleep; which you cannot decide to NOT do) or _all options can be chosen_ (e.g. you can buy everything you want if you are a billionaire), then there is _no opportunity cost_. Opportunity cost can change as new choices (information) become available (e.g. suddenly finding gold/oil under your business's hotel).
    - 10 principles of economics / opportunity cost / reason for including the _explicit opportunity cost_ ::: This is a frequent confusion. It would seem like the _explicit opportunity cost_ should be not included because it is _usually_ a direct cost of the choice being made and should not belong to the value of the _best alternative forgone_. However, if you consider that the direct cost of the current choice can also have _alternative uses_, then it is clear why the direct cost should also be included.
    - 10 principles of economics / opportunity cost / sunk cost ::: Opportunity cost is a _forward-looking_ concept, because _previously incurred and irreversible_ costs should be ignored when making decisions _now_. This cost is known as __sunk cost__. Why should we ignore it when making decisions? This is because no matter what decision you make right now, it will not affect sunk costs. Hence the name "_sunk_ cost".

      - [§ explicit costs](../../../../general/opportunity%20cost.md#explicit%20costs)
      - [§ implicit costs](../../../../general/opportunity%20cost.md#implicit%20costs)
      - [§ sunk costs](../../../../general/opportunity%20cost.md#sunk%20costs)
  - 10 principles of economics / (3) marginalism (rational people think at the margin) ::: Is human rational? What is rationality? You could "explain" rationality by saying some behaviors are rational and others are irrational, but this is rather arbitrary. A less _ad hoc_ way to explain rationality is using _principles_. Economists use the principle of __marginalism__.
    - 10 principles of economics / marginalism / assumptions ::: Economists _usually_ assume people are perfectly rational and have complete information. Incomplete information _may_ make perfectly rational people appear irrational, even though the perfectly rational people are making the most rational choice given that information is incomplete. And in real life, people are _not_ perfectly rational, but we can still research them by borrowing tools on human behaviors from _psychology_, relaxing the assumption of perfect rationality.
    - 10 principles of economics / marginalism / details ::: __Marginal unit__ is an additional unit, e.g. products, goods, etc. __Marginal benefit__ refers to the benefit of having an extra unit, and __marginal cost__ refers to the cost of having an extra unit, both given that you have a certain amount of something. Usually, the marginal benefit decreases as you have more of that something, known as the __law of diminishing marginal utility__. Perfectly rational people will keep getting extra units until the marginal benefit decreases enough to equate to the marginal cost.

      - [§ law of diminishing marginal utility](../../../../general/marginalism.md#law%20of%20diminishing%20marginal%20utility)
    - 10 principles of economics / (4) incentive (people respond to incentives) ::: People are not machines and you (usually :/) cannot just order people to do something. However, you can use __incentives__ to guide people's behaviors _significantly_. Incentives lead to intended consequences, but may also lead to __unintended consequences__, because people react to incentives _smartly_ (for perfectly rational people, this is maximizing their benefits given the incentives).
      - 10 principles of economics / incentive / rent regulation ::: Can rent regulation protect poor people from rent increase? Maybe... but also maybe not. Landlords may decide to not rent, spend less money on maintaining the rental units, etc. This is an example of _unintended consequences_. Indeed, the consensus of many economists is that rent regulation reduces the quantity and quality of rental units.
    - 10 principles of economics / (5) trade ::: It can make everyone better off. This will be explained in chapter 3. (Or see _comparative advantage_...)
      - [opportunity cost § comparative advantage versus absolute advantage](../../../../general/opportunity%20cost.md#comparative%20advantage%20versus%20absolute%20advantage)
    - 10 principles of economics / (6) market economy ::: __Markets__ (__market economy__) are _usually_ a good way, in terms of efficiency to the society, to organize economic activities. Under __perfect competition__, this is true. However, in real life situations where perfect competition may not hold, markets may fail to be most efficient for the society, and this is known as __market failure__.
