## week 1 lecture

- datetime: 2024-09-02T16:30:00+08:00/2024-09-02T17:50:00+08:00
- a core question of microeconomics ::: What do you WANT?
- course logistics
  - course intended learning outcomes (CILOs) ::: microeconomic analysis, decision making, demand-supply framework, market mechanism in different market structures, economic effect of the government, application
  - objectives ::: to analyze situations through the lens of microeconomics, but not memorization (Of course, some is still required...); a "way of economic thinking" should be developed on your own at the end
- strength and weaknesses of economics ::: It can explain how rational individuals make choice under constraints. But it cannot explain well how a group of people (the society) evolve over a long period time; instead, these are studied by history, psychology, sociology, etc.
- quirks about the professor ::: He does not follow the textbook strictly to deepen your thinking (good), makes exam questions based on current issues (cool), and does not care about attendance (good).
- discussions
  - discussions / face mask ::: Should the government intervene in the (previously sky-high) selling price of face masks? This is known as [price control](price%20controls.md).
  - discussions / waste charging scheme ::: Should the government charge waste generation and how? What problems may arise?
  - discussions / more inductive questions ::: high property prices, poverty reduction, education subsidy, China–US trade war, market/free economy vs. planned economy vs. others, etc.

- way of economic thinking ::: Analyze people's choice under constraints. We assume that people maximize the utility (e.g. happiness) of their choice. We also assume that people have constraints (e.g. budget), or otherwise there is no need to make choices — just choose everything!
  - way of economic thinking / motivation ::: We receive much information from the world everyday, then we interpret it and make predictions based on it. Different people interprets and predicts differently. Whoever make the best prediction based on their interpretation will be the winners. The "way of economic thinking" can help with making better interpretations and hence predictions.
- 10 principles of economics ::: These are some fundamentals principles of economics. Okay, these 10 principles is more of a pedagogical (teaching) tool to introduce us to economics...
  - 10 principles of economics / (1) scarcity (people face trade-offs) ::: Why do people face trade-offs? Because people are short of "something"! Thinking about how to spend your time? You are short of time. Why do you need to pay for "something"? Because there is not enough of "something" to satisfy everyone. This is known as __scarcity__, which depends on _both_ "availability" (supply) and "want" (demand).

      - [§ scarce goods](../../../../general/scarcity.md#scarce%20goods)
      - [§ nonscarce goods](../../../../general/scarcity.md#nonscarce%20goods)
  - 10 principles of economics / (2) opportunity cost (choices and opportunity cost) ::: __Opportunity cost__ is the "cost" we usually talk about in economics. Unless otherwise specified or inferred, the word "cost" refers to _opportunity cost_. It is the the value of the best alternative forgone (this includes the _explicit cost_ of the selected choice), given that you have to make a choice. There is __explicit opportunity cost__, which is opportunity cost that requires either a cash transaction or a physical transfer of resources, and thus is easily identifiable. But there is also __implicit opportunity cost__, which is opportunity cost that involves neither a cash transaction nor a physical transfer of resources.
    - 10 principles of economics / opportunity cost / definitions ::: Opportunity cost may _rarely_ only refer to _implicit opportunity cost_. In that case, __economic cost__ is sometimes used to refer the _sum_ of explicit (also called __accounting cost__) and implicit opportunity cost. In this course, __opportunity cost__ includes _both_ explicit and implicit opportunity cost.
    - 10 principles of economics / opportunity cost / choice ::: If there is no choice to be made, either because there is _one and only one available option_ (e.g. food, sleep; which you cannot decide to NOT do) or _all options can be chosen_ (e.g. you can buy everything you want if you are a billionaire), then there is _no opportunity cost_. Opportunity cost can change as new choices (information) become available (e.g. suddenly finding gold/oil under your business's hotel).
    - 10 principles of economics / opportunity cost / reason for including the _explicit opportunity cost_ ::: This is a frequent point of confusion. It would seem like the _explicit opportunity cost_ should be not included because it is _usually_ a direct cost of the choice being made and should not belong to the value of the _best alternative forgone_. However, if you consider that the direct cost of the current choice itself also have _alternative uses_, then it is clear why the direct cost should also be included.
    - 10 principles of economics / opportunity cost / sunk cost ::: Opportunity cost is a _forward-looking_ concept, because _previously incurred and irreversible_ costs should be ignored when making decisions _now_. This cost is known as __sunk cost__. Why should we ignore it when making decisions? This is because no matter what decision you make right now, it will not affect sunk costs. Hence the name "_sunk_ cost".

      - [§ sunk costs](../../../../general/opportunity%20cost.md#sunk%20costs)
  - 10 principles of economics / (3) marginalism (rational people think at the margin) ::: Is human rational? What is rationality? You could "explain" rationality by saying some behaviors are rational and others are irrational, but this is rather arbitrary. A less _ad hoc_ way to explain rationality is using _principles_. Economists use the principle of __marginalism__.
    - 10 principles of economics / marginalism / assumptions ::: Economists _usually_ assume people are perfectly rational and have complete information. Incomplete information _may_ make perfectly rational people appear irrational, even though the perfectly rational people are making the most rational choice given that information is incomplete. And in real life, people are _not_ perfectly rational, but we can still research them by borrowing tools on human behaviors from _psychology_, relaxing the assumption of perfect rationality.
    - 10 principles of economics / marginalism / details ::: __Marginal unit__ is an additional unit, e.g. products, goods, etc. __Marginal benefit__ refers to the benefit of having an extra unit, and __marginal cost__ refers to the cost of having an extra unit, both given that you have a certain amount of something. Usually, the marginal benefit decreases as you have more of that something, known as the __law of diminishing marginal utility__. Perfectly rational people will keep getting extra units until the marginal benefit decreases enough to equate to the marginal cost.

- 10 principles of economics
  - 10 principles of economics / (4) incentive (people respond to incentives) ::: People are not machines and you (usually :/) cannot just order people to do something. However, you can use __incentives__ to guide people's behaviors _significantly_. Incentives lead to intended consequences, but may also lead to __unintended consequences__, because people react to incentives _smartly_ (for perfectly rational people, this is maximizing their benefits given the incentives).
    - 10 principles of economics / incentive / rent regulation ::: Can rent regulation protect poor people from rent increase? Maybe... but also maybe not. Landlords may decide to not rent, spend less money on maintaining the rental units, etc. This is an example of _unintended consequences_. Indeed, the consensus of many economists is that rent regulation reduces the quantity and quality of rental units.
  - 10 principles of economics / (5) trade ::: It can make everyone better off. This will be explained in chapter 3. (Or see _comparative advantage_...)
    - [opportunity cost § comparative advantage versus absolute advantage](../../../../general/opportunity%20cost.md#comparative%20advantage%20versus%20absolute%20advantage)
  - 10 principles of economics / (6) market economy ::: __Markets__ (__market economy__) are _usually_ a good way, in terms of efficiency to the society, to organize economic activities. Under __perfect competition__, this is true. However, in real life situations where perfect competition may not hold, markets may fail to be most efficient for the society, and this is known as __market failure__.

  - assignment: [problem set 2](assignments/problem%20set%202/submission.md)
- [correlation](../../../../general/correlation.md) ::: Two things (more likely than expected to) appear at the same time, i.e. you can see A and B happening together.
  - [§ correlation](../../../../general/correlation.md#correlation)
- [causality](../../../../general/causality.md) ::: A causes B. A must happen before B in time. Correlation is not necessarily causation. We also need the additional two requirements of keeping everything else the same, and A happens before B, to conclude a correlation is also a causation.
  - [§ causality](../../../../general/causality.md#causality)
- omitted variable ::: They are variables that exist but not considered in your causation analysis. Assume A correlates with B, and B causes C. Omitting B may lead us to erroneously assume that A causes C.
- reverse causality ::: Assume A causes B. You observe that A correlates with B. You may erroneously conclude that B causes A. This is because regardless if A causes B or B causes A, A correlates with B. So it is not possible to distinguish between A causes B and B causes A, given we only know that A correlates with B. Extra information is needed to do so.
- scientific method ::: observe, explain using a (simplified) model, test by real-world observations
  - scientific method / economics ::: It is rare to do _control experiments_ because the conditions are almost impossible to be set like those in the model.
  - scientific method / economic models (examples) ::: circular-flow model, production possibilities frontier
  - scientific method / models ::: Models usually have many assumptions to keep it simple. The assumptions can be almost real, or completely out-of-reality. However, the usefulness of a model depends on its explanatory and predictive power.
- [positive and normative economics](../../../../general/positive%20and%20normative%20economics.md) ::: Positive: What is? We simply describe economics as-is. These statements are testable. Normative: What should be? We apply our own value judgement, which may differ from individuals to individuals.
  - Why do economists disagree with each other? ::: Economists can disagree with each other! \*grasp\* This could be a difference of scientific judgement, such as different economics schools of thought. The schools of thought predict different things with different theories, and it is difficult to create natural experiments to test them and see which are better. Another source is value judgement, such as the ultimate goal of studying economics.

  - assignment: [problem set 3](assignments/problem%20set%203/submission.md)
- exchange ::: It is transferring things with economic value to others, with said others giving back other things with economic value, usually money.
  - exchange / When? ::: The first scenario is maybe we have the same item, but said item has different economic values to us. Or I have more of the item so its marginal utility to me is low due to the law of diminishing marginal utility. The second scenario is we produce different items, and we produce our own item at a lower cost (= opportunity cost) than anyone can. The second one is more significant. In both cases, both parties benefit from exchange. In the latter case, it also leads to specialization of production.
- [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) ::: labor, capital, land, and entrepreneur/enterprise
  - [§ factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md#factors%20of%20production)
  - [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) / substitution ::: The factors of production may be able to substitute each other. For example, if a work can be done by either labor or machine, then labor and capital substitutes each other.
  - [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) / labor :: Labor does not refer to _person_, but rather _effort_. Many people, but none working at all, contributes no labor. Thus, incentives to work are also important, such as institution and compensation systems. Additionally, machinery or tools can improve labor productivity (amount of production per person). Developed countries usually have good incentive systems and many machinery and tools, which can be measured by capital per capita.
  - [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) / entrepreneur ::: It refers to how the other three factors are combined by entrepreneurs by make a profit. It distinguishes _labor effort_ and _risk-taking behavior_.
  - [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) / land ::: Land not only includes the site of production but also its natural resources. Land is mostly created by nature, but nowadays can be changed _slightly_ by humans.
  - [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) / capital ::: __Capital creation__ is interesting. We can invest capital to get more capital back in the future. This is known as a __trade-off__ of current and future consumption.
  - [factors of production](../../../../general/factors%20of%20production.md) / examples ::: For example, a fisherman buying (has (opportunity) cost, sacrificing current consumption) a fish net (__investment__) to better catch fish (__return to capital__) is a trade-off. The fisherman is using his/her _capital_. Also, note that the fisherman is providing _labor_ himself/herself. Finally, also note that the fisherman also has _entrepreneurship_, because he/she needs to bear the risk of not recovering all the cost of his/her initial investment (_risk-taking behavior_). The _land_ is the location he/she fishes in and provides fish, a natural resource.
- [division of labour](../../../../general/division%20of%20labour.md) ::: separation of tasks by different entities, _may_ increase the total output of all entities, benefiting everyone via trade
  - [§ division of labour](../../../../general/division%20of%20labour.md#division%20of%20labour)
- [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) (PPF) ::: A graphical representation showing all the possible options of output for two goods that can be produced using all factors of production. It is an awesome tool to visualize the gain from economic specialization.
  - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / model ::: It is a good model. A scenario with 2 goods can be described by a diagram, and scenarios with 2 or more goods can be described using mathematical equations. A scenario with one good is not considered because there is no _trade-off_ and does not show how specialization benefits everyone. So the model is good because it can explain how specialization benefits everyone well.
  - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram ::: The diagram is a graph between two goods produced. The order does not matter. Graph the resulting curve by evaluating, given that we have limited resources (factors of production) and we produce a certain amount of a good, the maximum amount of the other good that can be produced.
    - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram / interpretation ::: The curve border is known as the __frontier__. The area inside the frontier (including the frontier) is feasible given limited resources (factors of production), while outside the frontier (excluding the frontier) is infeasible given limited resources. A _rational_ person would only produce on the frontier as it is _efficient_, because being inside the frontier (excluding the frontier) means there are unused capacity (__production inefficiency__), while being outside the frontier (excluding the frontier) is impossible. The slope (derivative multiplied by -1) at any point represents the producer __marginal rate of transformation__, i.e. how much of one good needs to be given up to produce a certain amount of the other good. This is also the _marginal (opportunity) cost_ of producing one good, given only these two goods can be produced.

  - [§ opportunity cost](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md#opportunity%20cost)
- [absolute advantage](../../../../general/absolute%20advantage.md) (AA) ::: the ability of a party (an individual, or firm, or country) to produce a good or service more efficiently than its competitors (≈ compare (value / _explicit_ opportunity cost) and see which is higher)
  - [§ absolute advantage](../../../../general/absolute%20advantage.md#absolute%20advantage)
  - [absolute advantage](../../../../general/absolute%20advantage.md) / specialization ::: Absolute advantage should NOT be used to judge whether specialization will be beneficial. Instead use comparative advantage.
  - [§ origin of the theory](../../../../general/absolute%20advantage.md#origin%20of%20the%20theory)
- [comparative advantage](../../../../general/comparative%20advantage.md) (CA) ::: the ability of a party (an individual, or firm, or country) to produce a good can be produced at a lower relative opportunity cost or autarky price, i.e. at a lower relative marginal cost prior to trade, than its competitors (≈ compare (opportunity cost / value) and see which is lower)
  - [§ comparative advantage](../../../../general/comparative%20advantage.md#comparative%20advantage)
  - [comparative advantage](../../../../general/comparative%20advantage.md) / specialization ::: Comparative advantage should be used to judge whether specialization will be beneficial. In particular, this will result in maximizing the total output.
  - [§ classical theory and David Ricardo's formulation](../../../../general/comparative%20advantage.md#classical%20theory%20and%20David%20Ricardo's%20formulation)
- [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md)
  - joint [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) (joint PPF) ::: The joint PPF represents the total outputs of multiple producers producing multiple goods. Usually we have two producers producing two goods.
    - joint [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram ::: Assume we have two producers producing two goods. To graph it as a diagram, we need to add some constraints, or otherwise a 4D diagram is needed.
      - joint [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram / constraints ::: To graph it as a diagram, we need to add some constraints, or otherwise a 4D diagram is needed. There are three common constraints. Assume A better _fully_ specializes in X and B better _fully_ specializes Y, using comparative advantages to determine the better specialization.
        - joint [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram / constraints / best full specialization ::: This constraint is the curve joined by two curves, with one curve being the PPF of B assuming A fully specializes in X, and the other curve being the PPF of A assuming B fully specializes in Y. They should meet at a point, representing A fully specializing in X and B fully specializing in Y, the best scenario. The final curve should also curve outward.
        - joint [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram / constraints / worst full specialization ::: This constraint is the curve joined by two curves, with one curve being the PPF of B assuming A fully specializes in Y, and the other curve being the PPF of A assuming B fully specializes in X. They should meet at a point, representing A fully specializing in Y and B fully specializing in X, the worst scenario. The final curve should also curve inward.
        - joint [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram / constraints / unspecialized ::: Assume the PPFs of both producers are _linear_. When they are not both linear, this constraint does not make much sense. The constraint is the percentages of actual X produced divided by maximum X produced are the same for both producers. This is also equivalent to the percentages of actual Y produced divided by maximum Y produced are the same for both producers. The resulting curve should be a _straight line_ in between the two curves constrained as above (best and worst full specialization), and meeting the two curves at the two endpoints (x-axis and y-axis). It represents the _joint PPF without specialization_.
      - joint [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / diagram / interpretation ::: Assume the PPFs are _linear_ and the three curves constrained as above are drawn. The curved outward curve should be the "best full specialization" curve. The curved inward curve should be the "worst full specialization" curve. The straight line curve in between should be the "unspecialized" curve, meeting the two curves above at the two endpoints (x-axis and y-axis). The outward point on the curved outward curve represents both producers fully specialize in their own best-specialized goods, thus producing the most total output. The two endpoints represent both producers producing one good only. Lastly, the "unspecialized" curve represents the producers not specializing in anything. The area in between the "best full specialization" and "unspecialized" curve is the _gain from specialization_.
  - nonlinear [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) ::: Note that _nonlinear_ PPFs may make _full_ specialization no longer maximizes the total output.

- [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md)
  - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / division of total output ::: However, note that while specialization _may_ maximize the total output, both parties only benefit from this when the total output can be _divided fairly_ among the two producers. If there is no way to do so, specialization will not happen. One way to divide the total output fairly is _trade_.
  - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / trade ::: One simple way to think about trade is the _exchange ratio_. It is very simple actually. If the marginal (opportunity) cost of producing a good is lower than its marginal benefit (from the exchange ratio), then the producer is willing to trade. If this is the case for both producers producing in their own better specialized products, then they will trade with each other. This is how trade can divide the total output fairly.
    - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / trade / exchange ratio ::: But how is the ratio determined? This is where supply and demand comes in, which we will learn soon. In a market, the ratio is also known as the _market price_. To conclude, PPF provides information on the supply side, but we also need to know the demand side to known the ratio, i.e. the _price_, if in a market.
  - [production–possibility frontier § shape](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md#shape) ::: If the PPF bows outwards, this imply the marginal cost of a good increases as more of that good is produced. A way to see this compare the slopes. As you increase production of the good in the x-axis, the slope becomes increasingly steep, so the marginal (opportunity) cost of said good increases. (There are also other possible shapes.)
    - [production–possibility frontier § shape](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md#shape) / specialization ::: Note how joint PPF also bows outwards for the "best full specialization" curve. Perhaps we can then imagine a society where everyone has their own strengths. Then their joint PPF would also bow outwards, and everyone specializing on their own strengths would yield the most total output. (This explanation is a quite not strict though...)
  - [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md) / growth ::: With additional resources or better technology (improved efficiency), we can produce more. As a result, the PPF curve would shift outwards. For resources, the PPF curve would shift outwards evenly. But for better technology, it can also shift outwards evenly, but can also shift outwards unevenly if better technology impacts one good more than the other.
  - [§ position](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md#position)
- trade & policy
  - trade & policy / Does free trade benefit everyone? ::: Free trade seems to benefit everyone, since the total output increases by specialization. However, in real world, this is much more complicated. Consider workers in different countries. If a country has lower opportunity cost for a good because the good is labor-intensive and said country pays lower wages, then workers of other countries may go out of work. In a way, the workers are competing across countries due to free trade instead of in their own country only. Workers may get lower wages as a result. Yet, since free trade lowers the marginal (opportunity) cost of goods, the workers can buy goods for cheaper. So it is hard to definitively say if the workers benefit from free trade. For an example, compare China and the United States.

- [production–possibility frontier](../../../../general/production–possibility%20frontier.md)
  - production–possibility frontier / trade
    - production–possibility frontier / trade / exchange ratio
- [market economy](../../../../general/market%20economy.md)
  - market economy / price signal ::: How does market economy facilitate trade? It uses __price signal__ to exchange information between buyers and sellers. It allocates _scarce_ resources this way.
  - market economy / market structure ::: classified by the number of sellers (and buyers)
- [scarcity](../../../../general/scarcity.md)
  - scarcity / fundamental questions ::: what, how, and for whom to produce
- [supply and demand](../../../../general/supply%20and%20demand.md) ::: An economic model of price determination in a market.
  - supply and demand / demand ::: It describes how much buyers are willing to buy given a price level. It can also be interpreted as the _maximum_ price buyers are willing to pay (__willingness to pay__, __WTP__) for a marginal unit given the buyers have already bought a certain quantity of units.
    - [willingness to pay](../../../../general/willingness%20to%20pay.md) (WTP) ::: It is the maximum price at or below which a consumer will definitely buy one unit of a product.
    - supply and demand / demand / factors ::: income, _law of diminishing utility_, preference, price of _related_ goods
    - [marginal utility § law of diminishing marginal utility](../../../../general/marginal%20utility.md#law%20of%20diminishing%20marginal%20utility) ::: The marginal utility of a good or service is the utility of its [marginal use](marginal%20use.md). Under the assumption of economic rationality, it is the utility of its least urgent possible use _from_ the best feasible combination of actions in which its use is included. <p> As more of a good or service is provided, the most urgent possible uses are saturated, and the least urgent possible use becomes less urgent, thus its marginal utility decreases, given _other things being equal_. This explains why the demand curve is usually _assumed downward sloping_.
    - [law of demand](../../../../general/law%20of%20demand.md) ::: _Other things being equal_, the _quantity demanded_ of a good or service decreases when its _price_ increases, and vice versa.
    - "change in _demand_" vs "change in _quantity demanded_" ::: The former describes a shift in the demand curve itself, while the latter describes the effect of a price change, but the demand curve itself remains unshifted.
    - market demand ::: It is the sum of all individual demands at a particular price level. We can draw a _market demand schedule_ to describe this.
      - [market demand schedule](../../../../general/market%20demand%20schedule.md) ::: The first column is the price, the middle columns are the individual demands, and the final column is the market demand.
  - supply and demand / supply ::: It describes how much sellers are willing to sell given a price level. It can also be interpreted as the _minimum_ (not _maximum_) price sellers are willing to sell for a marginal unit given the sellers have already sold a certain quantity of units.
    - supply and demand / supply / slope ::: The supply curve is _usually assumed upward sloping_ because the marginal cost of producing an additional unit increases as more units are produced. For examples, machinery may run overtime (higher depreciation, maintenance) and workers may need to work overtime.
      - supply and demand / supply / slope / exceptions ::: What about "economies of scale"? Doesn't that mean producing more should have lower marginal cost? Does that mean the supply curve can also be flat or downward sloping? <p> The supply curve we are describing right now is the _short-run_ supply curve, which is usually upward sloping. The above usually only applies to the _long-run_ supply curve.
    - [law of supply](../../../../general/law%20of%20supply.md) ::: _Other things being equal_, the _quantity supplied_ of a good or service increases when its _price_ increases, and vice versa.
    - supply and demand / supply / factors ::: price of factor inputs, price of _related_ goods, technology change
    - "change in _supply_" vs "change in _quantity supplied_" ::: The former describes a shift in the supply curve itself, while the latter describes the effect of a price change, but the supply curve itself remains unshifted.
  - supply and demand / graph ::: Draw an empty _xy_ graph. Let the _x_-axis be the quantity. Let the _y_-axis be the price. Draw the demand curve (usually downward sloping) and the supply curve (usually upward sloping). The curves may or may not touch the _x_-axis or _y_-axis. The point where the demand and supply curves meet is the _equilibrium_ price and quantity. <p> Notations: _P_ is the price, _Q<sup>d</sup>_ is the quantity demanded, _Q<sup>s</sup>_ is the quantity supplied, _P\*_ is the _equilibrium_ price, and _Q\*_ is the _equilibrium_ quantity.

- [economic equilibrium](../../../../general/economic%20equilibrium.md)
  - market equilibrium ::: A condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by buyers is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by sellers.
    - market equilibrium / names ::: The price is called the __competitive price__, __equilibrium price__ or __market clearing price__. The quantity is called the __competitive quantity__, __equilibrium quantity__, or __market clearing quantity__.
      - [market clearing](../../../../general/market%20clearing.md)
    - market equilibrium / cause ::: It is caused by "bargaining" between buyers and sellers. The number of buyers and sellers affect the market ("bargaining") power of respectively buyers and sellers, thus affecting the market equilibrium.
    - [market structure](../../../../general/market%20structure.md) ::: It depicts how firms are differentiated and categorized based on the types of goods they sell (homogeneous/heterogeneous) and how their operations are affected by external factors and element.
      - market structure / number of sellers ::: monopoly (one seller, many buyers), oligopoly (few sellers, many buyers), monopolistic competition (many sellers but with differentiated products, many buyers), perfect competition (many sellers, many buyers)
      - market structure / number of buyers ::: monopsony (many sellers, one buyer), oligopsony (many sellers, few buyers), perfect competition (many sellers, many buyers)
      - [monopoly](../../../../general/monopoly.md) ::: A market with the "absence of competition", creating a situation where a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular thing.  
        - monopoly / graph ::: Additionally graph a line known as the marginal revenue (MR) curve. Said curve is usually even more downward sloping then the demand curve. The point where the MR curve and the supply curve meets is the market equilibrium in a monopoly, because this brings the maximum profit for a company in monopoly. Said point has a higher price and lower quantity than the market equilibrium in perfect competition.
        - [marginal revenue](../../../../general/marginal%20revenue.md) (MR) ::: The derivative of price multiplied by quantity. For monopoly, the curve is more downward sloping than the demand curve. For perfect competition, the curve is a constant horizontal line at the market equilibrium price.
      - [perfect competition](../../../../general/perfect%20competition.md) ::: A __perfect market__, also known as an __atomistic market__, is defined by several idealizing conditions, collectively called __perfect competition__, or __atomistic competition__. <p> It is usually used as a benchmark against other market structures for comparison. Perfect competition are _efficient_: They provide both _allocative efficiency_ and _productive efficiency_.
        - [allocative efficiency](../../../../general/allocative%20efficiency.md) ::: It is a state of the economy in which production is aligned with the preferences of consumers and producers; in particular, the set of outputs is chosen so as to maximize the social welfare of society.
        - [productive efficiency](../../../../general/productive%20efficiency.md) ::: It is a situation in which the economy or an economic system (e.g., bank, hospital, industry, country) operating within the constraints of current industrial technology cannot increase production of one good without sacrificing production of another good.
        - perfect competition / assumptions ::: There are many more assumptions, and we state three of them here: homogeneous products, many sellers and buyers, and perfect information (full information).
          - perfect competition / assumptions / homogeneous products ::: The products are perfect substitutes for each other. For example, a bottle of Coca-Cola is the same no matter where you buy it. An counterexample is restaurant: Any restaurant can satisfy your hunger needs, but the food they provide are different.
          - perfect competition / assumptions / many sellers and buyers ::: If there are many sellers and buyers, each seller and each buyer does not have enough market ("bargaining") power to set prices. If there is only one seller or one buyer, the one individual can set prices. If there are only few sellers or few buyers, they may still collude together to set prices.
          - perfect competition / assumptions / perfect information ::: All buyers and sellers know all prices of products and utilities they would get from owning each product. There are no information that only a few buyers or sellers know that would give them a competitive advantage.
        - perfect competition / examples ::: There are no real life examples that exactly matches the model. However, some are close, such as electronic markets (e.g. Amazon), which spread information quickly.
        - perfect competition / implications ::: All quantity of a good are sold at the same market price. If not, one would do _arbitrage_, where one buys at a lower price from a seller and re-sell to others at a higher price. <p> No buyers are willing to pay a higher price. No sellers can sell higher or need to sell lower.
        - perfect competition / names ::: Buyers and sellers in such a market structure are __price takers__. Such a market is also known as __price-taker market__.
        - [market clearing](../../../../general/market%20clearing.md) ::: It is the process by which, in an economic market, the supply of whatever is traded is equated to the demand so that there is no excess supply or demand, ensuring that there is neither a surplus nor a shortage.
          - market clearing / price is higher than equilibrium ::: There will be excess supply, and inventory builds up. So most sellers would lower price to try to clear its inventory. As a result, market price decreases and approaches the equilibrium.
          - market clearing / price is lower than equilibrium ::: There will be excess demand, and buyers may sometimes cannot find products for sale. So buyers are willing to pay more to get the product in shortage. As a result, market price increases and approaches the equilibrium.
- [supply and demand](../../../../general/supply%20and%20demand.md)
  - supply and demand / advantages ::: It is a convenient framework to model how market price changes due to demand-side factors and supply-side factors.
  - supply and demand / disadvantages ::: It cannot explain how long it takes to reach the market equilibrium. It cannot also explain how the market price will change exactly (the "path") before reaching the equilibrium.
- [price](../../../../general/price.md) ::: A price is the (usually not negative) quantity of payment or compensation expected, required, or given by one party to another in return for goods or services.
  - price / use ::: Its main use is for the allocation of scarce resources. Whoever _pays the highest_ can get the scarce resources. And the price determines _what_ and _how much_ to produce for different scarce resources. <p> It organizes production activities in a _decentralized_ way. Self-interests of individuals and firms drive the price.
  - price / planned economy ::: For comparison, in a planned economy, allocation of scarce resources is done by the government only. For example, China before economic reform (1979) was mainly a planned economy.

- [supply and demand](../../../../general/supply%20and%20demand.md)
  - [demand](../../../../general/demand.md)
    - [demand curve](../../../../general/demand%20curve.md)
    - "change in _demand_" vs "change in _quantity demanded_"
    - change in demand ::: change in the relation between quantity demanded at each price
      - change in demand / graph ::: Usually, we move the demand curve horizontally, not vertically. Note that for a straight line, these two produce the same results.
      - change in demand / factors ::: They are _non-price determinants_ of demand: consumer preferences, expectation about the future, income, number of buyers (e.g. population growth), prices of _related_ goods.
        - change in demand / factors / consumer preferences ::: What consumers prefer. For example, fashion may affect it.
        - change in demand / factors / income ::: What consumers buy responds to their incomes. Examples include normal goods, inferior goods, etc.
- types of goods ::: ordinary goods ← normal goods (luxury/superior goods, necessity goods), Giffen goods → inferior goods
  - [normal good](../../../../general/normal%20good.md) ::: It is a type of a goods which experiences an increase in demand due to an increase in income. For you, they are goods that you want more as you have more money.
  - [inferior good](../../../../general/inferior%20good.md) ::: It is goods the demand for which falls with increase in income of the consumer. For you, they are not-as-good goods that you will substitute with better goods once you have enough money.
- related goods ::: complementary goods, substitute goods, independent goods
  - [substitute good](../../../../general/substitute%20good.md) ::: Two goods are substitutes if you can use one of them instead of the other to satisfy a purpose. Technically, it displays a positive _cross elasticity of demand_ and that demand (curve) for it decreases when the price of another good decreases.
  - [complementary good](../../../../general/complementary%20good.md) ::: Two goods are complements if they are used together to satisfy a purpose. Technically, it displays a negative _cross elasticity of demand_ and that demand (curve) for it increases when the price of another good decreases.
  - [independent good](../../../../general/independent%20good.md) ::: Two goods that are neither substitutes nor complements. Technically, they are goods that have a zero _cross elasticity of demand_.
  - [cross elasticity of demand](../../../../general/cross%20leasticity%20of%20demand.md)
- [supply and demand](../../../../general/supply%20and%20demand.md)
  - [demand](../../../../general/demand.md)
    - change in demand
      - change in demand / factors
        - change in demand / factors / expectation about the future ::: For example, if most people believe the price of property will be going up (even though one can never be 100% sure), demand for property increases. <p> Expectation about the future is enough to affect the supply and demand _right now_. So managing expectation is also important. However, it is complicated and hard to analyze.
  - [supply](../../../../general/supply%20(economics).md)a
    - "change in _supply_" vs "change in _quantity supplied_"
    - change in supply ::: change in the relation between quantity supplied at each price
      - change in supply / graph ::: Usually, we move the supply curve horizontally, not vertically. Note that for a straight line, these two produce the same results.
      - change in supply / factors ::: They are _non-price determinants_ of supply: expectation about the future, number of sellers, price of inputs (factors of production), price of _related_ goods, technology.
        - change in supply / factors / price of inputs, technology ::: Price of factors of production (inputs) directly affects the production cost. Advancement in technology can improve the efficiency of using factors of production.
        - change in supply / factors / expectation about the future ::: For example, if suppliers expect the selling price of a good to increase, the supplier may produce more now, stock them, and sell later. <p> Expectation about the future is enough to affect the supply and demand _right now_. So managing expectation is also important. However, it is complicated and hard to analyze.
- related goods in production ::: complementary goods in production, substitute goods in production, independent goods in production
  - substitute goods in production ::: Two goods are substitutes in production if their production rely on the same inputs. Examples: land to grow vegetable or fruit.
  - complementary goods in production ::: Two goods are complements in production if they are produced together (joint products). Examples: beef and leather; diesel, gasoline, kerosene, etc. from refining crude oil.
  - related goods in production ::: The price change of one good affects the supply (curve) of the other good.

  - assigned reading: textbook chapter 5
  - assignment: [problem set 5](assignments/problem%20set%205/submission.md)
- [elasticity](../../../../general/elasticity%20(economics).md) ::: __Elasticity__ measures the responsiveness of one economic variable to a change in another.
  - elasticity / motivation ::: While supply and demand can tell us how quantity and price changes, it does not tell us the magnitude of change. Elasticity can tell us, _quantifying_ this change.
  - elasticity / examples ::: own price elasticity, income elasticity, cross-price elasticity, ...
    - own price elasticity ::: Another name for __price elasticity of demand__. It is the _percentage_ change in _quantity of a good_ demanded in response to a _percentage_ change in _price of the same good_.
    - income elasticity ::: Another name for __income elasticity of demand__. It is the _percentage_ change in _quantity demanded of a good_ in response to a _percentage_ change in _income_.
    - cross-price elasticity ::: Another name for __cross elasticity of demand__. It is the _percentage_ change in _quantity demanded of a good_ in response to a _percentage_ change in _price of another good_.
  - elasticity / perfectly inelastic ::: It means the absolute value of elasticity is 0, i.e. |_ε_| = 0.
  - elasticity / inelastic ::: It means the absolute value of elasticity is less than 1, i.e. |_ε_| < 1.
  - elasticity / unit elastic ::: it means the absolute value of elasticity is 1, i.e. |_ε_| = 1.
  - elasticity / elastic ::: it means the absolute value of elasticity is more than 1, i.e. |_ε_| > 1.
  - elasticity / perfectly elastic ::: it means the absolute value of elasticity is infinity, i.e. |_ε_| = ∞.
- [price elasticity of demand](../../../../general/price%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md) ::: A measure of how sensitive the quantity demanded of a good is to its price.
  - price elasticity of demand / formula ::: _All other things being equal_, $$E_{(P)} = \frac {\Delta Q / Q} {\Delta P / P} \,,$$ where $P$ is the _initial_ (not _final_ or _average_) price of the good demanded, $\Delta P$ is how much it changed, $Q$ is the _initial_ (not _final_ or _average_) quantity of the good demanded, and $\Delta Q$ is how much it changed. We use the starting point formula for percentage change.
    - price elasticity of demand / formula / other formulas ::: There are at least two other common formulas for the price elasticity of demand, but we will ignore them for now. (We use the starting point formula for percentage change.)

- [price elasticity of demand](../../../../general/price%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md)
  - price elasticity of demand / factors ::: In general, the easier a consumer can "escape" from consuming a good, the higher the price elasticity of demand. Four major factors are: broadness of definition, substitution effect, time frame, and type of goods.
    - price elasticity of demand / factors / substitution effect ::: If a good is easily substituted by other goods, its elasticity is higher, and vice versa.
      - [substitution effect](../../../../general/substitution%20effect.md)
    - price elasticity of demand / factors / type of goods ::: If a good is _luxurious_, its elasticity is higher. If a good is _necessary_, its elasticity is lower. <p> An example is even if water price is high, you will still try to buy (almost) as much water.
      - [luxury goods](../../../../general/luxury%20goods.md) ::: A good for which demand increases more than what is proportional as income rises, so that expenditures on the good become a more significant proportion of overall spending.
      - [necessity good](../../../../general/necessity%20good.md) ::: A good for which demand increases less than what is proportional as income rises, so that expenditures on the good become a less significant proportion of overall spending.
      - [goods § types of goods](../../../../general/goods.md#types%20of%20goods)
    - price elasticity of demand / factors / broadness of definition ::: If you define your goods broadly (e.g. soft drinks), then elasticity is lower, and vice versa (e.g. Coca-Cola). <p> An extreme example to bring the point is that if you define your goods to be "all goods in existence", then a consumer can never "escape" from consuming said goods by definition.
    - price elasticity of demand / factors / time frame ::: The longer the time frame we are considering, the higher the elasticity, and vice versa. <p> An example is car fuel. If the price of car fuel rises, in the short run, you will likely just accept it, but in the long run, you may be thinking of eventually switching to an electric car.
      - [long run and short run](../../../../general/long%20run%20and%20short%20run.md)
  - price elasticity of demand / sign ::: It is usually negative. However, positive elasticity is possible for Giffen goods...
    - [Giffen good](../../../../general/Giffen%20good.md) ::: It is a product that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa, violating the law of demand.
  - price elasticity of demand / graph ::: How to see if the price elasticity of demand is elastic or inelastic on a point on the demand curve? <p> Ensure the graph corner is (0, 0) and the graph is not truncated. Draw a line from (0, 0) to the point on the demand curve. Flip it horizontally across the point (equivalent to multiplying its slope by -1). Said line is the slope if |_ε_| = 1. Compare the slope of the demand curve at that point to said line. If the (absolute) slope of the demand curve is higher, then it is _inelastic_. If the (absolute) slope of the demand curve is lower, then it is _elastic_. Otherwise, it is _unit elastic_. Extreme cases are covered by respectively vertical line (_perfectly inelastic_) and horizontal line (_perfectly elastic_).
    - price elasticity of demand / graph / linear demand ::: Using the above method, we can see for linear demand, the top-left portion is elastic, the bottom-right portion is inelastic, and a point in between them is unit elastic. <p> An alternative way to see it is by rearranging the formula: $$E_{(P)} = \frac {\Delta Q / Q} {\Delta P / P} = \frac {\Delta Q} {\Delta P} \cdot \frac P Q \,,$$ and we can see $\frac {\Delta Q} {\Delta P}$ is constant, but $\frac P Q$ changes.
  - price elasticity of demand / revenue ::: Revenue (not subtracted by cost) is the area of the rectangle enclosed by (0, 0) and the equilibrium point. <p> By changing the equilibrium point along the demand curve, we can see that the point where price elasticity of demand is unit elastic maximizes the area of the rectangle, so revenue is maximized. Thus, we can derive the following rules: If demand is elastic, we should decrease price to maximize revenue, and vice versa for inelastic demand.
  - price elasticity of demand / application ::: There is drug-related crime. We can either try to interdict or educate. Assume both policies work equally effectively. <p> Interdiction decreases the supply (curve) of drugs, while education decreases the demand (curve) of drugs. <p> For the former, inelastic demand curve increases expenditure on drugs while elastic demand curve decreases expenditure on drugs. For the latter, both inelastic and elastic demand curve decreases expenditure on drugs, but inelastic demand curve leads to a higher decrease. Comparing the two methods given the same elasticity, the latter is more effective than the former at reducing expenditure.
- [cross elasticity of demand](../../../../general/cross%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md) ::: It measures the effect of changes in the price of one good on the quantity demanded of another good.
  - cross elasticity of demand / formula ::: _All other things being equal_, $$\text{XED} = \frac {\%\text{ change in quantity demanded of good A} } {\%\text{ change in price of good B}}  \,.$$ We use the starting point formula for percentage change.
    - cross elasticity of demand / formula / other formulas ::: There are at least two other common formulas for the cross elasticity of demand, but we will ignore them for now. (We use the starting point formula for percentage change.)
  - cross elasticity of demand / sign ::: Positive means the goods are substitutes, negative means the goods are complements, and zero means the goods are independent.
- [income elasticity of demand](../../../../general/income%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md) ::: It is the responsivenesses of the quantity demanded for a good to a change in consumer income.
  - income elasticity of demand / formula ::: _All other things being equal_, $$\epsilon_{d}= \frac {\%\ {\text{change in quantity demanded} } } {\%\ {\text{change in income} } } \,.$$ We use the starting point formula for percentage change.
    - income elasticity of demand / formula / other formulas ::: There are at least two other common formulas for the income elasticity of demand, but we will ignore them for now. (We use the starting point formula for percentage change.)
  - income elasticity of demand / sign ::: It is positive for normal goods. For normal goods, elastic means the good is luxury while inelastic means the good is necessary. Negative elasticity is possible for inferior goods.
    - [inferior good](../../../../general/inferior%20good.md)
- [price elasticity of supply](../../../../general/price%20elasticity%20of%20supply.md) ::: It is a measure used in economics to show the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity supplied of a good or service to a change in its price.
  - price elasticity of supply / formula ::: _All other things being equal_, $$E_{(P)} = \frac {\Delta Q / Q} {\Delta P / P} \,,$$ where $P$ is the _initial_ (not _final_ or _average_) price of the good supplied, $\Delta P$ is how much it changed, $Q$ is the _initial_ (not _final_ or _average_) quantity of the good supplied, and $\Delta Q$ is how much it changed. We use the starting point formula for percentage change.
    - price elasticity of supply / formula / other formulas ::: There are at least two other common formulas for the price elasticity of supply, but we will ignore them for now. (We use the starting point formula for percentage change.)
  - price elasticity of supply / sign ::: It is usually positive. However, negative elasticity is possible under economies of scale...
  - price elasticity of supply / factors ::: In general, the easier a producer can change the quantity of goods produced, the higher the price elasticity of supply. Two major factors are: resource substitution possibilities and time frame.
    - price elasticity of supply / factors / resource substitution possibilities (substitution effect in production) ::: If the inputs of a good is easily changed to produce other goods, its elasticity is higher, and vice versa.
    - price elasticity of supply / factors / time frame ::: The longer the time frame we are considering, the higher the elasticity, and vice versa. In more details, the longer the time frame, the more the producer can change its production methods to adapt to the new price. <p> An example is setting up a new plant to produce other things. Notice that setting up a new plant takes a long time.
      - [long run and short run](../../../../general/long%20run%20and%20short%20run.md)
  - price elasticity of supply / graph ::: How to see if the price elasticity of supply is elastic or inelastic on a point on the supply curve? <p> Ensure the graph corner is (0, 0) and the graph is not truncated. Draw a line from (0, 0) to the point on the supply curve. Said line is the slope if |_ε_| = 1. Compare the slope of the supply curve at that point to said line. If the (absolute) slope of the supply curve is higher, then it is _inelastic_. If the (absolute) slope of the supply curve is lower, then it is _elastic_. Otherwise, it is _unit elastic_. Extreme cases are covered by respectively vertical line (_perfectly inelastic_) and horizontal line (_perfectly elastic_).
    - price elasticity of demand / graph / linear supply ::: For linearly supply, if the line passes through the origin, it is _unit elastic_. If the line passes through the _y_-axis above the origin, it is _elastic_. If the line passes through the _y_-axis below the origin, it is _inelastic_.
    - price elasticity of demand / graph / normal assumptions ::: Normally, the supply curve is increasingly sloped. This means the supply curve becomes less elastic as quantity increases. This is often due to capacity limits.

- [price elasticity of supply](../../../../general/price%20elasticity%20of%20supply.md)
  - price elasticity of supply / application ::: The supply of apartment at the seafront of Victoria Harbor is inelastic. The supply of new cars is elastic. Suppose population growth causes demand for both double. What happens to the equilibrium price and quantity? <p> To model this, we draw a more elastic supply curve and a less elastic supply curve. Then, draw a demand curve. Draw the new demand curve by doubling the quantity at each price level. This should make the new demand curve have half the absolute slope of the old demand curve. <p> Finally, you should find out that for the more elastic supply curve, quantity changes more than the price, while for the less elastic supply curve, price changes more than the quantity.
- cross elasticity of supply ::: It measures the effect of changes in the price of one good on the quantity supplied of another good.
  - cross elasticity of supply / formula ::: _All other things being equal_, $$\text{XES} = \frac {\%\text{ change in quantity supplied of good A} } {\%\text{ change in price of good B}}  \,.$$ We use the starting point formula for percentage change.
    - cross elasticity of supply / formula / other formulas ::: There are at least two other common formulas for the cross elasticity of supply, but we will ignore them for now. (We use the starting point formula for percentage change.)
  - cross elasticity of supply / sign ::: Positive means the goods are complements in production, negative means the goods are substitutes in production, and zero means the goods are independent in production.

- [scarcity](../../../../general/scarcity.md)
  - scarcity / competition ::: _Scarcity_ necessities _competition_. We must compete to get the scarce thing. <p> Competition can come in many forms, such as boxing fight, running race, beauty, etc. Different ways of competition have different _winners_. If you can control the way of competition, you would likely choose the one that gives yourself the most favorable outcome out of self-interest. <p> Free market economy is also a form of competition, an economic way to allocate scarce resources.
    - scarcity / competition / examples ::: academia, free market economy, medical services, police services, etc.
    - scarcity / competition / free market economy ::: Does free market economy do a good job? What criteria will you use to determine this? It could be efficiency, ethics, fairness, or "I like it"... <p> In positive economics, we use _efficiency_. More specifically, it is the _gains from trade_. In an economy, this is the _social surplus_ or _total surplus_, which is the sum of _consumer surplus_ and _producer surplus_.
- [gains from trade](../../../../general/gains%20from%20trade.md)
- [economic surplus](../../../../general/economic%20surplus.md) ::: either _consumer surplus_ or _producer surplus_
  - consumer surplus ::: It is the monetary gain obtained by consumers because they are able to purchase a product for a price that is less than the highest price that they would be _willing to pay_.
    - [willingness to pay](../../../../general/willingness%20to%20pay.md)
    - consumer surplus / calculation ::: Calculate the highest price that consumers would be _willing to pay_ minus the actual price paid for each unit. The sum over all units actually bought is the __consumer surplus__. <p> In general, this is the area above the equilibrium price of the good and below the demand curve.
    - consumer surplus / interpretation ::: It is _usually_ a good measurement of economic well-being (welfare) of a society. But there are controversial ones, such as drugs, trade for human organs, etc. where there is a difference between individual and society perspective.
  - producer surplus ::: It is the amount that producers benefit by selling at a market price that is higher than the least that they would be _willing to sell for_; this is roughly equal to profit (since producers are not normally willing to sell at a loss and are normally indifferent to selling at a break-even price).
    - producer surplus / calculation ::: Calculate the actual price minus the lowest price that producers would be _willing to sell for_ for each unit. The sum over all units actually sold is the __producer surplus__. <p> In general, this is the area below the equilibrium price but above the supply curve.
- demand schedule ::: It is a table. The left column shows the price (ranges), in decreasing amount. The right column shows the quantity demanded, in increasing amount. For break-even price, we assume the relevant consumers still consume.
- supply schedule ::: It is a table. The left column shows the price (ranges), in decreasing amount. The right column shows the quantity supplied, in decreasing amount. For break-even price, we assume the relevant producers still supply.
- [economic surplus](../../../../general/economic%20surplus.md)
  - total surplus ::: The sum of _consumer surplus_ and _producer surplus_.
    - total surplus / calculation ::: Add the _consumer surplus_ and _produce surplus_. Alternatively, calculate the highest price that consumers would be _willing to pay_ minus the lowest price that producers would be _willing to sell for_ for each unit for each unit. The sum over all units actually traded is the __total surplus__. <p> In general, this is the area above the supply curve and below the demand curve.
    - total surplus / maximization ::: It is maximized when the actual quantity traded is the equilibrium quantity. In __overproduction__, the value to the buyer is below the cost of production for the _overproduced units_. In __underproduction__, the value to the buyer is above the cost of production for the _un-produced units_, so more units can be produced to increase the total surplus further. <p> From an economic perspective, this is _efficient_, no matter under what form of competition.
    - total surplus / division ::: Note that the equilibrium price decides how the total surplus is divided into consumer surplus and producer surplus. The division may not be _fair_ in your view: the consumer surplus can be much larger or much smaller than the producer surplus.
- [planned economy](../../../../general/planned%20economy.md) ::: It is a type of economic system where investment, production and the allocation of capital goods takes place according to economy-wide economic plans and production plans.
  - planned economy / efficiency ::: Theoretically, if the _planner_ knows the demand curve and supply curve perfectly, and absolute authority on how units are produced and allocated, then you can try to simulate a free market economy by producing Q\*, then allocating them to consumers with the highest _willingness to pay_. <p> In practice, the above assumptions are very difficult to achieve in the first place (__information problem__). Even if the above assumptions hold, the _planner_ needs to allocate things in the above way ("benevolent" planner).
- [market economy](../../../../general/market%20economy.md)
  - market economy / efficiency ::: Under _perfect information_, market incorporates all information of buyers and sellers. Furthermore, the self-interests of buyers and sellers makes the produced resources allocated to buyers with the highest _willingness to pay_. It is like there is an _invisible hand_.
    - [invisible hand](../../../../general/invisible%20hand.md) ::: It is a metaphor inspired by the Scottish economist and moral philosopher Adam Smith that describes the incentives which _free markets_ sometimes create for self-interested people to accidentally act in the public interest, even when this is not something they intended.
  - market economy / limitations ::: Markets can fail to achieve efficiency in some situations. This is called __market failure__. Some situations include when the market is not _perfectly competitive_, __externalities__, and the good is a __public good__. <p> The _government_ can step in in these situations to try to achieve efficiency. This will be discussed later.
    - [market failure](../../../../general/market%20failure.md) ::: It is a situation in which the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not _Pareto efficient_, often leading to a net loss of economic value.
    - [externality](../../../../general/externality.md) ::: It is an _indirect cost or benefit_ to an uninvolved third party that arises as an effect of another party's (or parties') activity.
    - [public good](../../../../general/public%20good%20(economics).md) ::: It is a good that is both _non-excludable_ and _non-rivalrous_. Use by one person neither prevents access by other people, nor does it reduce availability to others.

  - assignment: [problem set 7](assignments/problem%20set%207/submission.md)
- [price controls](../../../../general/price%20controls.md) ::: They are restrictions set in place and enforced by governments, on the prices that can be charged for goods and services in a market. It could be a price ceiling or a price floor.
  - price controls / motivation ::: People may believe the equilibrium price is not appropriate or desirable from their perspective.
- [price ceiling](../../../../general/price%20ceiling.md) ::: It is a government- or group-imposed price control, or limit, on how high a price is charged for a product, commodity, or service. Examples include rent control.
  - [rent regulation](../../../../general/rent%20regulation.md) ::: It is a system of laws for the rental market of dwellings, with controversial effects on affordability of housing and tenancies.
- [price floor](../../../../general/price%20floor.md) ::: It is a government- or group-imposed price control or limit on how low a price can be charged for a product, good, commodity, or service. Examples include minimum wage.
  - [minimum wage](../../../../general/minimum%20wage.md) ::: It is the lowest remuneration that employers can legally pay their employees—the price floor below which employees may not sell their labor.
- price controls
  - price controls / motivation
    - price controls / motivation / government ::: health, protect low-income group, protect low-skill workers, special interest groups (e.g. voting)
- [price ceiling](../../../../general/price%20ceiling.md)
  - price ceiling / graph ::: On a supply and demand graph, draw a horizontal line that represents the price ceiling. If the equilibrium price is lower than or equal to the price ceiling, nothing interesting happens. Otherwise, the price will be capped to the price ceiling. <p> For normal supply and demand curve, the quantity demanded (Qd') is higher than the quantity supplied (Qs'). The difference between them is the shortage.
    - price ceiling / graph / economic surplus ::: Compare the economic surplus before and after imposing the price ceiling. the producer surplus decreases, while the consumer surplus may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged. The total surplus decreases, and this decrease is known as __deadweight loss__. We can also see that some producer surplus becomes consumer surplus due to _lower price_ (reallocation), while the rest becomes deadweight loss due to decrease in _quantity supplied_. Some consumer surplus also becomes deadweight loss due to decrease in _quantity supplied_.
      - [deadweight loss](../../../../general/deadweight%20loss.md) ::: It is the loss of societal economic welfare due to production/consumption of a good at a quantity where marginal benefit (to society) does not equal marginal cost (to society) – in other words, there are either goods being produced despite the cost of doing so being larger than the benefit, or additional goods are not being produced despite the fact that the benefits of their production would be larger than the costs.
  - price ceiling / allocation ::: Under price ceiling, price and willingness to pay is no longer the dominant factor in determining who gets the scarce resources. Those with lower willingness to pay can compete with those with higher willingness to pay due to the price ceiling. Other __price rationing methods__ and __non-price rationing methods__ may appear to allocate said resources (e.g. lottery, social).
    - price ceiling / allocation / price rationing methods ::: Usually such mechanisms still let those with higher willingness to pay to get the scarce resource, preventing further decrease in consumer surplus. Examples include black market (higher price than price ceiling), grey-area payment, etc. <p> These methods tend to transfer economic surplus back from consumer surplus to producer surplus, and increases the quantity supplied, i.e. tends to the economy equilibrium. <p> _Corruption_ is also similar to black market, so it may be beneficial to the society in the short run, but creates inefficiency in the long run.
      - [black market](../../../../general/black%20market.md) ::: It is a clandestine market or series of transactions that has some aspect of illegality or is not compliant with an institutional set of rules.
    - price ceiling / allocation / non-price rationing methods ::: Usually such mechanisms let those with lower willingness to pay to have a chance to get the scarce resource, further decreasing consumer surplus. Examples include landlords picking tenants they prefer, lottery by government, etc.
  - price ceiling / benefit & loss ::: It seems fair to buyers who can pay a lower price. But also consider buyers who cannot do so due to shortage. Black markets may raise the actual price beyond the price ceiling, however. Deadweight loss means society as a whole is harmed.
  - price ceiling / enforcement ::: If enforcement is completely effective, the price ceiling is the actual price. But in practice, enforcement is not completely effective, then black markets appear, which increases actual supply and actual price, tending towards the economic equilibrium. In the extreme case of no enforcement, the price ceiling may do nothing, and the price and quantity stay at the economic equilibrium.
    - price ceiling / enforcement / corruption ::: Corruption is somewhat similar to black market, so it may improve economic efficiency in the short run. However, corruption also involves non-price elements, requiring a special type of social network. People spend resources that could have been used for other productive resources on building up such a social network. As a result, efficiency decreases in the long run.
  - price ceiling / short run and long run ::: The supply and demand curve differs in the short run and long run. Compare with in the short run, the long run curves are more elastic and thus more flatten. The shortage becomes even more serious.
    - price ceiling / short run and long run / interpretation ::: For suppliers, price ceiling means in the long run, they switch production to other goods, so supply decreases further. Also, suppliers may try to cut costs, such as poor maintenance on rental apartment ("het best way to destroy a city is by rent control"). <p> For consumers, price ceiling means in the long run, due to the substitution effect, demand increases further. <p> As a result, the shortage becomes more serious in the long run.
- [price floor](../../../../general/price%20floor.md)
  - price floor / graph ::: Ony a supply and demand graph, draw a horizontal line that represents the price floor. If the equilibrium price is higher than or equal to the price floor, nothing interesting happens. Otherwise, the price will be capped to the price floor. <p> For normal supply and demand curve, the quantity demanded (Qd') is lower than the quantity supplied (Qs'). The difference between them is the _excess supply_ or _surplus_ (in labor market, this is _unemployment_).
    - price floor / graph / economic surplus ::: Compare the economic surplus before and after imposing the price floor. the producer surplus may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged, while the consumer surplus decreases. The total surplus decreases, and this decrease is known as __deadweight loss__. We can also see that some consumer surplus becomes producer surplus due to _higher price_ (reallocation), while the rest becomes deadweight loss due to decrease in _quantity demanded_. Some producer surplus also becomes deadweight loss due to decrease in _quantity demanded_.
      - [deadweight loss](../../../../general/deadweight%20loss.md)
  - price floor / allocation ::: Under price floor, price and willingness to sell is no longer the dominant factor in determining who supplies the scarce resources. Those with lower willingness to sell can compete with those with higher willingness to sell due to the price floor. Other __price rationing methods__ and __non-price rationing methods__ may appear to supply said resources (e.g. lottery, social).
    - price floor / allocation / price rationing methods ::: Usually such mechanisms still let those with higher willingness to sell to supply the scarce resource, preventing further decrease in producer surplus. Examples include black market (lower price than price floor), grey-area payment, etc. <p> These methods tend to transfer economic surplus back from producer surplus to consumer surplus, and increases the quantity supplied, i.e. tends to the economy equilibrium.
      - [black market](../../../../general/black%20market.md)
    - price floor / allocation / non-price rationing methods ::: Usually such mechanisms let those with lower willingness to sell to have a chance to supply the scarce resource, further decreasing producer surplus.
  - price floor / benefit & loss ::: It seems fair to suppliers who can get paid a higher price. But also consider suppliers who cannot do so due to surplus. Black markets may reduce the actual price beyond the price floor, however. Deadweight loss means society as a whole is harmed.
    - price floor / benefit & loss / labor markets ::: In a labor market, teenagers, elderly, those with low productivity, etc. are more likely not be hired in a price floor. The labor markets for them likely have their equilibrium prices below the price floor. High productivity workers, skilled labor, etc. may not be affected by the price floor. The labor markets for them likely have their equilibrium prices above the price floor. <p> This shows an economy can have multiple markets.
  - price floor / enforcement ::: If enforcement is completely effective, the price floor is the actual price. But in practice, enforcement is not completely effective, then black markets appear, which increases actual demand and decreases actual price, tending towards the economic equilibrium. In the extreme case of no enforcement, the price floor may do nothing, and the price and quantity stay at the economic equilibrium.
  - price floor / short run and long run ::: The supply and demand curve differs in the short run and long run. Compare with in the short run, the long run curves are more elastic and thus more flatten. The surplus becomes even more serious.
    - price floor / short run and long run / interpretation ::: For suppliers, price floor means in the long run, they switch production to said goods, so supply increases further. For labor markets, more people may want to join the job market, e.g. dropping out of school early. <p> For consumers, price floor means in the long run, due to the substitution effect, demand decreases further. For labor markets, this may mean companies are forced out of business. <p> As a result, the surplus becomes more serious in the long run.
- [price controls](../../../../general/price%20controls.md)
  - [price controls](../../../../general/price%20controls.md) / summary ::: People respond to incentives smartly. Price controls intervene with the price signal in a market. If enforcement is perfect, then it "works". Otherwise, black markets and other allocation methods appear, some of which tends the actual price and quantity to the economic equilibrium, while some others decrease economic surpluses further. <p> Regardless of enforcement, the total surplus decreases (_deadweight loss_). Price controls is only effective for reallocating the total surplus in between consumer surplus and producer surplus. But even then, it may decrease the surplus it intends to increase because the total surplus has decreased by too much.

  - assigned reading: textbook chapter 8
  - assignment: [problem set 8](assignments/problem%20set%208/submission.md)
- income tax quote ::: "The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax." — Albert Einstein
- [tax](../../../../general/tax.md) ::: It is a mandatory financial charge or levy imposed on a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization to support government spending and public expenditures collectively or to regulate and reduce negative externalities.
  - tax / motivation ::: The government needs money to operate its infrastructure, legal system, military, etc. The government can also use it as a policy tool for public health, imports, income redistribution, etc.
  - tax / examples ::: Corporate tax, income tax, sales tax, tariff (import tax)
  - [tax incidence](../../../../general/tax%20incidence.md) ::: It is the effect of a particular tax on the distribution of economic welfare. Economists distinguish between the entities who ultimately bear the tax burden and those on whom the tax is initially imposed. The tax burden measures the true economic effect of the tax, measured by the difference between real incomes or utilities before and after imposing the tax, and taking into account how the tax causes prices to change.
    - tax incidence / intuition ::: Compare the price (including the tax) before and after the tax. If the price rises by the tax amount, then buyers pay the tax. If the price does not rise at all, then sellers pay the tax. In between, buyers and sellers share the tax burden.
- [tax](../../../../general/tax.md)
  - tax / types ::: _ad valorem_ tax (tax according to value), per unit tax, ...
    - [_ad valorem_ tax](../../../../general/ad%20valorem%20tax.md) ::: A tax whose amount is based on the value of a transaction or of a property. <p> The supply or demand curves shift horizontally, touching the initial curve when the price is zero and increasingly deviating as the price grows.
    - [per unit tax](../../../../general/per%20unit%20tax.md) ::: A tax that is defined as a fixed amount for each unit of a good or service sold. <p> The supply or demand curve shifts horizontally, with a fixed gap between the initial curve and the final curve.
  - tax incidence / target ::: Tax may be imposed on the seller or buyer (or both). The one who has tax imposed on has its curve shifted.
  - [effect of taxes and subsidies on price](../../../../general/effect%20of%20taxes%20and%20subsidies%20on%20price.md)
  - tax incidence / graph ::: For simplicity, we only consider _per unit tax_. Depending if the seller or buyer has tax imposed on, the corresponding curve is shifted horizontally. If you consider both cases, you obtain two different new points the curves meet on. One of the point is higher than the other in price, but their quantities are the same. <p> After we take the tax into account, we would find that in both cases, buyers pay at the point that is higher in price, while sellers receive at the point that is lower in price, so it turns out both cases have the same effect. The tax burden is simply the difference compared to the equilibrium price without tax. For sellers, this is the equilibrium price subtracted by the lower price. For buyers, this is the higher price subtracted by the equilibrium price.
    - tax incidence / graph / alternative ::: For simplicity, we only consider _per unit tax_. If so, then there is an alternative way to see the effect of tax on a graph. Tax moves the quantity to a point where the demand curve is higher than the supply curve by the tax amount. For _per unit tax_, this amount is fixed. So we can easily find the new quantity this way.
  - tax incidence / elasticity ::: It turns out tax incidence depends on the _relative_ elasticities of the supply and demand curve compared to each other. The rule is simple: the more elastic the supply or demand curve, the less relative burden the corresponding side bears. Of course, remember that it is _relative_ elasticities between them that matters. <p> This can be easily seen by using the alternative way to visualize tax incidence on a graph, and then realize that for both the supply and demand curve, the closer the curve is to a horizontal line, the more elastic it is.
    - tax incidence / elasticity / perfectly elastic demand ::: If supply is unit elastic and demand is perfectly elastic, then the supply bears all tax burden. The demand can completely "escape" the tax.
    - tax incidence / elasticity / perfectly inelastic demand ::: If supply is unit elastic and demand is perfectly inelastic, then the demand bears all tax burden. The demand cannot "escape" the tax at all, even by a slight amount.
    - tax incidence / elasticity / perfectly elastic supply ::: If supply is perfectly elastic and demand is unit elastic, then the demand bears all tax burden. The supply can completely "escape" the tax.
    - tax incidence / elasticity / perfectly inelastic supply ::: If supply is perfectly inelastic and demand is unit elastic, then the supply bears all tax burden. The supply cannot "escape" the tax at all, even by a slight amount.
    - tax incidence / elasticity / supply is more elastic than demand ::: If supply is more elastic than demand, the supply bears less tax burden. The supply can "escape" _more_ than the demand.
    - tax incidence / elasticity / supply is less elastic than demand ::: If supply is less elastic than demand, the supply bears more tax burden. The supply can "escape" _less_ than the demand.
    - tax incidence / elasticity / application ::: 1990: Congress adopted a luxury tax on yachts, private airplanes, furs, expensive cars, etc. to raise revenue from those who could most easily afford to pay—wealthy consumers. But was it true that the wealthy cusomters paid this tax? <p> Compare the _relative elasticities_. Supply is inelastic _in the short run_, while demand is elastic because the goods are luxury. So the supply (the luxury producers) bears more tax burden than the demand (wealthy customers) _in the short run_.

- [tax incidence](../../../../general/tax%20incidence.md)
  - tax incidence / deadweight loss ::: Similar to price ceiling and price floor, the quantity supplied and demanded will be below the equilibrium quantity due to tax. This creates deadweight loss, which shows up in the same area in the graph. <p> The deadweight loss triangle can be split into two by the equilibrium price line. Above is the consumer surplus lost due to price being higher due to tax. Below is the producer surplus lost due to producers being forced to produce at a cheaper price in order to make profit.
    - [deadweight loss](../../../../general/deadweight%20loss.md)
    - tax incidence / deadweight loss / implications ::: So tax, while useful for the government, creates a net loss to the society. The government should choose the goods to be taxed carefully to minimize deadweight loss.
    - tax incidence / deadweight loss / elasticity ::: For simplicity, consider _per unit tax_ only. Elasticities of both the demand and supply curves determine the deadweight loss. Increase in the elasticity of the demand or supply curve (or both) increases the deadweight loss. <p> This can be visualized by realizing the deadweight loss triangle's base length is always the same: the per unit tax amount, and its height is determined by the elasticities of both the demand and supply curves. Since more elastic curves are closer to a horizontal line, this increases the height of the deadweight loss triangle.
      - tax incidence / deadweight loss / elasticity / inelastic supply ::: When supply is inelastic, deadweight loss is smaller. It is hard for producers to "escape" the market.
      - tax incidence / deadweight loss / elasticity / elastic supply ::: When supply is elastic, deadweight loss is larger. It is easy for producers to "escape" the market.
      - tax incidence / deadweight loss / elasticity / inelastic demand ::: When demand is inelastic, deadweight loss is smaller. It is hard for consumers to "escape" the market.
      - tax incidence / deadweight loss / elasticity / elastic demand ::: When demand is elastic, deadweight loss is larger. It is easy for consumers to "escape" the market.
  - tax revenue ::: The __tax revenue__ is the area of rectangle extended to the left from the deadweight loss triangle in a graph. It can be split into two portions by the equilibrium price line. Above is the consumer surplus transferred to the government. Below is the producer surplus transferred to the government.
- [tax](../../../../general/tax.md)
  - tax / government ::: The government uses tax to provide public services and redistribute wealth from high-income group to low-income group. However, tax cannot be too high, or otherwise deadweight loss is high. (For example, if income tax (on labor) is high, you may not want to work.)
    - tax / government / welfare state ::: In a welfare state, the government may have high taxes to provide all kinds of welfare to its citizens. The deadweight loss may make this ineffective, however. For developed countries with high GDP, the deadweight loss may be bearable, but for developing countries with low GDP, the deadweight loss can be destructive.
      - tax / government / welfare state / failure example ::: China adopted "collective" farm/factory system before, that is all people worked in a farm/factory, ate in communal dining place, while the government provided all other services of daily life. <p> The result was no one worked, and the economy collapsed, which lead to economic reform in 1979. After the economic reform, the GDP of China has grown rapidly.
      - [welfare state](../../../../general/welfare%20state.md) ::: It is a form of government in which the state (or a well-established network of social institutions) protects and promotes the economic and social well-being of its citizens, based upon the principles of equal opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for citizens unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life.
  - tax revenue
    - tax revenue / factors ::: Does a higher tax rate brings more tax revenue? Not necessarily! As tax increases, deadweight loss increases at an increasingly fast rate. Eventually, the deadweight loss reduces the tax revenue by too much. Imagine 100% tax rate: No one will produce and consume, so there is no tax revenue. <p> This can be seen in a supply and demand graph as well. As tax increases, quantity increasingly move to the left, approaching zero. This is the decrease in tax revenue due to deadweight loss. <p> The __Laffer curve__ illustrates a theoretical relationship between rates of taxation and the resulting levels of the government's tax revenue.
      - [Laffer curve](../../../../general/Laffer%20curve.md) ::: It illustrates a theoretical relationship between rates of taxation and the resulting levels of the government's tax revenue. It assumes that no tax revenue is raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100%, meaning that there is a tax rate between 0% and 100% that maximizes government tax revenue.
