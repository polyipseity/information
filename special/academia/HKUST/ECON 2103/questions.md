> Q1. What is the opportunity cost of attending a concert?
>
> 1. the price you pay for the ticket and the value of your time
> 2. the price you pay for the ticket, but not the value of your time
> 3. the value of your time, but not the price you pay for the ticket
> 4. neither the price of the ticket nor the value of your time
>
> - solution: {{1}}

> Q2. You are earning $30&nbsp;000 per year. Now, you have an opportunity to enroll in a one-year Master program that requires you to quit your job. Which of the following should not be included in the opportunity cost of study?
>
> 1. the cost of tuition and books for study
> 2. the $30&nbsp;000 salary that you could have earned if you retain your job
> 3. the $45&nbsp;000 salary that you will be able to earn after having completed your graduate program
> 4. the value of insurance coverage and other employee benefits you would have received if you retain your job
>
> - solution: {{3}}

> Q3. You are selling your 1996 Toyota. You have already spent $10&nbsp;000 on repairs. At the last minute, the transmission dies. You can pay $6&nbsp;000 to have it repaired, or sell the car "as is". What should you do in the following cases?
>
> 1. The selling price is $65&nbsp;000 if the transmission works, otherwise $57&nbsp;000.
> 2. The selling price is $60&nbsp;000 if the transmission works, otherwise $55&nbsp;000.
>
> - solution: {{1: repair and sell; 2: sell}}
> - explanation: {{Do not consider the already spent $10&nbsp;000 as it is a sunk cost. Only consider the marginal profit, which is the selling price, perhaps subtracted by the repair cost if you decide to repair the transmission. The decision for which the marginal profit is higher is what you should do.}}

> Q4. How many chicken wings should a perfectly rational person buy and eat? The chicken wings cost $5 each.
>
> - solution: {{The person should keep buying and eating chicken wings until the satisfaction the person gets from buying and eating an extra chicken wing (_marginal benefit_) is lower than its cost $5 (_marginal cost_). We assume that the _marginal benefit_ decreases the more chicken wings the person eats, because the person will get increasingly full. <p> By following the above, this maximizes the _net benefit_, i.e. _total benefit_ subtracted by _total cost_.}}

> Q5. How will changing the price of buffet affects the following decisions? Assume you are a perfectly rational person.
>
> 1. How much food should you eat, given that you have paid?
> 2. Should you pay for the buffet in the first place?
>
> - solution: {{For (1), you should still eat the same amount of food. The price you have paid for the buffet is sunk cost and should be ignored when analyzing how much food should you eat. The _marginal cost_ of food is the same, i.e, $0, and your _marginal benefit_ as a function of food consumed is also the same. The result is that you should eat the same amount of food, i.e. the amount where the _marginal benefit_ curve crosses the _marginal cost_ curve. For (2), you may change your decision. In this case, the _marginal unit_ becomes the buffet instead of its food. The _marginal benefit_ becomes the benefit of an extra buffet, which equals to the _total benefit_ of food you get in (1). The _marginal cost_ becomes the cost of an buffet (plus the _total cost_ of food in (1), but this is $0). If you change the price, the _marginal benefit_ does not change by (1), but the _marginal cost_ changes. So you may change your decision.}}

> Q6. Will compulsory use of seat belt reduce the no. of causality (death) from auto accident?
>
> 1. yes
> 2. no
> 3. don't know
> 4. none of the above
>
> - solution: {{3 (_theoretically_, and 1 from _empirical_ studies)}}
> - explanation: {{Seat belt makes one less likely to be seriously injured in accidents, but the drivers may drive faster because they feel "safer", compensating for the risk reduction. We do not know if the resulting risk is lower or higher than the resulting one _theoretically_. But from our _empirical_ studies (studies of having seat belt laws vs. not having seat belt laws in the real world), compulsory use of seat belt does reduce the no. of causality.}}

> Q7. Think of possible (intended or unintended) consequences for each of the following problem-and-solution pair.
>
> - Domestic (local) steel producers are threatened by foreign competition (imports). Let's impose a _tariff_ (fee) on importing steel. ::: The price of foreign steel may increase relative to domestic steel. Domestic steel producers may benefit from it. However, the average price of (domestic and imported) steel may rise, so downstream industries may have increased production cost and may pass them to consumers.
> - Rents are increasing. Let's freeze rents (a form of rent control). ::: In the short term, poor people may be less likely to be evicted due to not being able to pay rent. However, landlords may reduce maintenance on rental units to adapt to decreased rents. They may, in the long term, also construct fewer rental units because they are less profitable.
> - Medical costs are high. The government decides to offset everyone's medical costs, especially for poor people. ::: People, especially the poor, may be able to benefit from more healthcare. However, medical cost may increase further due to increased demand. Taxes may go up to subsidize this increased spending, so people have less income after taxes.
> - Commercial fishing for tuna kills dolphins. Let's require domestic fisheries to use more expensive nets that lets dolphins escape. ::: It may protect the dolphins. However, the price of domestic tuna may increase relative to foreign tuna. This means domestic fisheries may be harmed. Also, the average price of (domestic and imported) tuna may rise, so consumers may need to pay more. (The effects are similar to a _tariff_ (like above) but imposed on domestic producers instead.)
> - Drug addiction is a problem. Let's make it a non-problem by legalizing the use of drugs. ::: Drugs become more available. This lowers drug prices. People may get addicted to drugs more easily. However, it may decrease enforcement costs, regulate the drug market, and make rehabilitating drug addicts easier.
> - Drug addiction is a problem. Let's enforce drug laws more strictly. ::: Drugs become less available. This increases drug prices. People may get addicted to drugs less easily. However, it may increase drug trafficking activity due to increased profits if succeeded, increasing enforcement costs. Drug addicts may also commit more crimes in order to get money for drugs.
