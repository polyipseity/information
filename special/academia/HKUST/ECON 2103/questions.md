### chapter 1 lecture

> Q1. What is the opportunity cost of attending a concert?
>
> 1. the price you pay for the ticket and the value of your time
> 2. the price you pay for the ticket, but not the value of your time
> 3. the value of your time, but not the price you pay for the ticket
> 4. neither the price of the ticket nor the value of your time

> Q2. You are earning $30&nbsp;000 per year. Now, you have an opportunity to enroll in a one-year Master program that requires you to quit your job. Which of the following should not be included in the opportunity cost of study?
>
> 1. the cost of tuition and books for study
> 2. the $30&nbsp;000 salary that you could have earned if you retain your job
> 3. the $45&nbsp;000 salary that you will be able to earn after having completed your graduate program
> 4. the value of insurance coverage and other employee benefits you would have received if you retain your job

> Q3. You are selling your 1996 Toyota. You have already spent $10&nbsp;000 on repairs. At the last minute, the transmission dies. You can pay $6&nbsp;000 to have it repaired, or sell the car "as is". What should you do in the following cases?
>
> 1. The selling price is $65&nbsp;000 if the transmission works, otherwise $57&nbsp;000.
> 2. The selling price is $60&nbsp;000 if the transmission works, otherwise $55&nbsp;000.
>
> - solution: {{1: repair and sell; 2: sell}}
> - explanation: {{Do not consider the already spent $10&nbsp;000 as it is a sunk cost. Only consider the marginal profit, which is the selling price, perhaps subtracted by the repair cost if you decide to repair the transmission. The decision for which the marginal profit is higher is what you should do.}} <!--SR:!2025-02-21,106,290!2024-12-20,64,310-->

> Q4. How many chicken wings should a perfectly rational person buy and eat? The chicken wings cost $5 each.
>
> - solution: {{The person should keep buying and eating chicken wings until the satisfaction the person gets from buying and eating an extra chicken wing (_marginal benefit_) is lower than its cost $5 (_marginal cost_). We assume that the _marginal benefit_ decreases the more chicken wings the person eats, because the person will get increasingly full. <p> By following the above, this maximizes the _net benefit_, i.e. _total benefit_ subtracted by _total cost_.}} <!--SR:!2024-12-28,72,310-->

> Q5. How will changing the price of buffet affects the following decisions? Assume you are a perfectly rational person.
>
> 1. How much food should you eat, given that you have paid?
> 2. Should you pay for the buffet in the first place?
>
> - solution: {{For (1), you should still eat the same amount of food. The price you have paid for the buffet is sunk cost and should be ignored when analyzing how much food should you eat. The _marginal cost_ of food is the same, i.e, $0, and your _marginal benefit_ as a function of food consumed is also the same. The result is that you should eat the same amount of food, i.e. the amount where the _marginal benefit_ curve crosses the _marginal cost_ curve. For (2), you may change your decision. In this case, the _marginal unit_ becomes the buffet instead of its food. The _marginal benefit_ becomes the benefit of an extra buffet, which equals to the _total benefit_ of food you get in (1). The _marginal cost_ becomes the cost of an buffet (plus the _total cost_ of food in (1), but this is $0). If you change the price, the _marginal benefit_ does not change by (1), but the _marginal cost_ changes. So you may change your decision.}} <!--SR:!2025-01-20,75,270-->

> Q6. Will compulsory use of seat belt reduce the no. of causality (death) from auto accident?
>
> 1. yes
> 2. no
> 3. don't know
> 4. none of the above
>
> - solution: {{3 (_theoretically_, and 1 from _empirical_ studies)}}
> - explanation: {{Seat belt makes one less likely to be seriously injured in accidents, but the drivers may drive faster because they feel "safer", compensating for the risk reduction. We do not know if the resulting risk is lower or higher than the resulting one _theoretically_. But from our _empirical_ studies (studies of having seat belt laws vs. not having seat belt laws in the real world), compulsory use of seat belt does reduce the no. of causality.}} <!--SR:!2024-12-20,64,310!2024-11-20,34,290-->

> Q7. Think of possible (intended or unintended) consequences for each of the following problem-and-solution pair.
>
> - Domestic (local) steel producers are threatened by foreign competition (imports). Let's impose a _tariff_ (fee) on importing steel. ::: The price of foreign steel may increase relative to domestic steel. Domestic steel producers may benefit from it. However, the average price of (domestic and imported) steel may rise, so downstream industries may have increased production cost and may pass them to consumers. <!--SR:!2024-12-24,68,310!2024-12-24,68,310-->
> - Rents are increasing. Let's freeze rents. (This is a form of rent control.) ::: In the short term, poor people may be less likely to be evicted for their inability to pay rent. However, landlords may reduce maintenance on rental units to adapt to decreased rents. They may, in the long term, also construct fewer rental units because they are less profitable. <!--SR:!2024-11-20,34,290!2024-12-28,72,310-->
> - Medical costs are high. The government decides to offset everyone's medical costs, especially for poor people. ::: People, especially the poor, may be able to benefit from more healthcare. However, medical cost may increase further due to increased demand. Taxes may go up to subsidize this increased spending, so people have less income after taxes. <!--SR:!2024-12-16,60,310!2024-12-03,47,290-->
> - Commercial fishing for tuna kills dolphins. Let's require domestic fisheries to use more expensive nets that lets dolphins escape. ::: It may protect the dolphins. However, the price of domestic tuna may increase relative to foreign tuna. This means domestic fisheries may be harmed (e.g. decrease in market share). Also, the average price of (domestic and imported) tuna may rise, so consumers may need to pay more. (The effects are similar to a _tariff_ (like above), but reversed, i.e. imposed on domestic producers instead.) <!--SR:!2024-12-20,64,310!2024-11-20,34,290-->
> - Drug addiction is a problem. Let's make it a non-problem by legalizing the use of drugs. ::: Drugs become more available. This lowers drug prices. People may get addicted to drugs more easily. However, it may decrease enforcement costs, regulate the drug market, and make rehabilitating drug addicts easier. <!--SR:!2024-12-11,55,310!2024-12-11,55,310-->
> - Drug addiction is a problem. Let's enforce drug laws more strictly. ::: Drugs become less available. This increases drug prices. People may get addicted to drugs less easily. However, it may increase drug trafficking activity due to increased profits if succeeded, increasing enforcement costs. Drug addicts may also commit more crimes in order to get money for drugs. <!--SR:!2024-12-16,60,310!2024-12-20,64,310-->

### chapter 2 lecture

> Q1. Which of the following is correct about this statement? "Not every citizen has their own housing. Building more government subsidized housing helps more citizens have their own housing. So building more government subsidized housing would be top priority."
>
> 1. It is a normative statement.
> 2. It is a positive statement.
> 3. It is neither a normative statement nor a positive statement.
> 4. It is both a normative and a positive statement.
> 5. It contains both normative and positive statements.
> 6. We need more information to decide.
> 7. None of the above.
>
> - solution: {{5}}
> - explanation: {{The first two sentences are positive. The last sentence is normative.}} <!--SR:!2024-11-23,37,290!2024-12-28,72,310-->

> Q2. (2021 fall final exam) A salesperson introduces a mobile-data plan to Randy, which allows him to pay HK$800 per month and enjoy unlimited data usage. Randy said he is happy with the plan and is willing to subscribe to it.
>
> Explain the above Randy's decision by using a graph/graphs based on the concept of marginal utility/happiness, consumer surplus and marginal cost that we discussed in lectures. (5 points)
>
> - graph: {{![graph](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240922170908.png)}}
> - solution: {{Assume Randy has bought the plan for a month. Then his marginal utility curve and marginal cost curve is as in the graph. The marginal cost is zero because he can enjoy unlimited data usage. The marginal utility decreases by assuming the law of diminishing utility. This corresponds to him using the mobile-data on urgent uses first, and then less urgent uses, and continue. The marginal utility stops at zero because (I believe) extra data usage cannot have negative marginal utility, but it does not matter for this analysis. The consumer surplus is the area between marginal utility and marginal cost, and represents the benefit of the mobile-data plan to him before he makes the decision of buying the plan. So we can infer the reason he is happy with the plan is because his consumer surplus in a month exceeds HK$800.}} <!--SR:!2024-12-16,60,310!2024-11-23,37,290-->

<!-- markdownlint MD028 -->

> Q3. (2021 fall final exam) A salesperson introduces a mobile-data plan to Michael, which allows him to pay HK$200 per month and enjoy 20G of data usage. Michael said he is happy with the plan and is willing to subscribe to it. Note that Michael will use more than 20G of data when it is free-of-charge.
>
> Explain the above Michael's decision by using a graph/graphs based on the concept of marginal utility/happiness, consumer surplus and marginal cost that we discussed in lectures. (5 points)
>
> - graph: {{![graph](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240922172124.png)}}
> - solution: {{Assume Michael has bought the plan for a month. Then his marginal utility curve and marginal cost curve is as in the graph. The marginal cost is zero until 20 GB when he uses up all his data usage, after which there is a nonzero cost (that we do not know, but assume to be flat rate). The marginal utility decreases by assuming the law of diminishing utility. This corresponds to him using the mobile-data on urgent uses first, and then less urgent uses, and continue. The marginal utility reaches zero after but not before or on 20 GB because he will use more than 20 GB data if data is free. The marginal utility stops at zero because (I believe) extra data usage cannot have negative marginal utility, but it does not matter for this analysis. The consumer surplus is the area between marginal utility and marginal cost, and represents the benefit of the mobile-data plan to him before he makes the decision of buying the plan. So we can infer the reason he is happy with the plan is because his consumer surplus in a month exceeds HK$200.}} <!--SR:!2024-11-20,34,290!2024-12-30,60,270-->

### chapter 3 lecture

> Q1. In the capital creation process, one will need to take into account:
>
> 1. how much current consumption he has to
> 2. how much future consumption is expected to gain
> 3. his patience on consumption across time
> 4. all of the above
>
> - solution: {{4}}
> - explanation: {{When making an investment, one will consider its cost (1), its return (2), its risk (3), and its time needed (3). Time needed affects the _present value_ (PV) of return in the future. For example, high political instability will severely affect (3).}} <!--SR:!2024-12-24,68,310!2024-12-20,64,310-->

> Q2. Assuming the production–possibility frontiers (PPFs) for X and Y are both linear, under which of the following condition(s) will specialization between A and B leads to the _largest_ total output for them?
>
> 1. A is good at producing X and B is good at producing Y
> 2. A is good at producing both X and Y
> 3. B is good at producing both X and Y
> 4. all of the above
>
> - solution: {{4}}
> - explanation: {{If the production–possibility frontiers (PPFs) for X and Y are both linear, then full specialization in one of the goods will always lead to the lowest marginal (or equal) opportunity cost for both A and B. Their total output will be the _largest_. <p> Note that if the PPFs are nonlinear, then full specialization may not always produce the _largest_ total output, and may or may not lead to a _larger_ total output.}} <!--SR:!2024-12-24,68,310!2024-12-28,72,310-->

>
> 1. Astor has AA in B and better specializes in B
> 2. Astor has CA in B and better specializes in B
> 3. Teresa has AA in B and better specializes in B
> 4. Teresa has CA in B and better specializes in B
>
> - solution: {{4}}
> - explanation: {{We only consider CA when thinking what to specialize. For Teresa, his/her opportunity cost for B is $$10 / 20 = 0.5~\text{A/B}$$, while that for Astor is $$30 / 30 = 1~\text{A/B}$$. So Teresa has CA in B and better specializes in B.}} <!--SR:!2024-12-16,60,310!2024-12-28,72,310-->

>
> 1. Albert refuses exchange and choose self-sufficiency
> 2. Albert likes exchange and specialize in meat
> 3. Albert likes exchange and specialize in potato
> 4. none of the above
>
> - solution: {{2}}
> - explanation: {{Consider the marginal (opportunity) costs for Albert if he specializes in meat: $$16 / 24 = 2 / 3~\mathrm{potato/meat}$$. Also consider that if he specializes in potato: $$24 / 16 = 1.5~\mathrm{meat/potato}$$. If the marginal cost is lower than the marginal benefit, then Albert will exchange. In this case, if he specializes in meat, his marginal cost of meat is 2/3 potatoes per meat, which is lower than the marginal benefit of 1 potato per meat (market price) in the market. So he will specialize in meat and likes exchange.}} <!--SR:!2024-12-03,47,290!2024-12-24,68,310-->

> Q5. Assume for the United States that the opportunity cost of each airplane is 100 cars. Which of these pairs of points could be on the United States' production possibilities frontier?
>
> 1. (200 airplanes, 10000 cars) and (150 airplanes, 20000 cars)
> 2. (300 airplanes, 15000 cars) and (200 airplanes, 25000 cars)
> 3. (200 airplanes, 5000 cars) and (150 airplanes, 4000 cars)
> 4. (300 airplanes, 25000 cars) and (200 airplanes, 40000 cars)
>
> - solution: {{2}}
> - explanation: {{Note that 100 cars is the marginal (opportunity) cost of an airplane. Thus, simply check if the change in airplane multiplied by -100 equals the change in cars.}} <!--SR:!2024-12-24,68,310!2024-12-28,72,310-->

### chapter 4 lecture

> Q1. What can the model of demand and supply tell us?
>
> 1. before getting to equilibrium, the "path" of price changes
> 2. the equilibrium price and quantity
> 3. how long it take to reach the equilibrium
> 4. none of the above
>
> - solution: {{2}} <!--SR:!2024-11-26,18,336-->

<!-- markdownlint MD028 -->

> Q2. If equilibrium quantity of A increases, but equilibrium price remains the same, which of the following is correct?
>
> 1. demand for A decreases
> 2. supply for A increases
> 3. both demand and supply for A increase
> 4. demand for A increases and supply for A decreases
>
> - solution: {{3}}
> - explanation: {{If demand increase, both equilibrium quantity and price increase. If supply increase, equilibrium quantity increase but equilibrium price decreases. If both happens at the same time at the right extents, then we can make it such that equilibrium quantity increase but equilibrium price remains unchanged.}} <!--SR:!2024-11-25,17,336!2024-11-26,18,336-->

> Q3. Consider the demand curve for music downloads. Consider the change in the curve under the following scenarios:
>
> 1. The price of iPods/MP3 players falls.
> 2. The price of music downloads falls.
> 3. The price of CDs falls.
>
> - solution: {{For 1, the demand curve moves to the right, as music downloads and iPods/MP3 players are complements. For 2, the demand curve does not change, only the quantity demanded increases under the _law of demand_. For 3, the demand curve moves to the left, as music downloads and CDs are substitutes.}} <!--SR:!2024-11-24,16,336-->

<!-- markdownlint MD028 -->

> Q4. Consider the supply curve for tax return preparation software. Consider the change in the curve under the following scenarios:
>
> 1. Retailers cut the price of the software.
> 2. A technological advance allows the software to be produced at lower cost.
> 3. Professional tax return preparers raise the price of the services they provide.
>
> - solution: {{For 1, the supply curve does not change, only the quantity supplied decreases under the _law of supply_. For 2, the supply curve moves to the right. For 3, the supply curve does not change, but the demand curve shifts to the left, as tax return preparation software and professional tax return preparers are complements (but not complements _in production_).}} <!--SR:!2024-11-26,18,336-->

### chapter 5 lecture

> Q1. If the cross elasticities of demand of good A and B are positive, that means good A and B are:
>
> 1. substitutes
> 2. complements
> 3. all of the above
> 4. none of the above

<!-- markdownlint MD028 -->

> Q2. Which of the following is NOT a determinant of the price elasticity of supply?
>
> 1. time frame
> 2. specificity of inputs
> 3. consumer demand
> 4. excess capacity
>
> - solution: {{3}}
> - explanation: {{It would only affect the equilibrium price and quantity.}} <!--SR:!2024-11-26,18,336!2024-11-24,16,336-->

### chapter 8 lecture

> Q1. If the government imposes a tax on iPhone, who bears the tax burden/incidence?
>
> 1. sellers
> 2. consumers
> 3. both
> 4. neither
>
> - solution: {{3}}
> - explanation: {{Tax burden depends on both the elasticities of the demand and supply curve. Since neither curves are very unlikely to be perfectly elastic in the real world, both sellers and consumers bear the tax burden. However, we cannot tell the distribution of tax burden unless we have more information.}} <!--SR:!2024-11-11,4,321!2024-11-11,4,321-->

> Q2. For each of the following pairs of goods, explain which good would have a larger deadweight loss due to tax.
>
> 1. breakfast cereal, sunscreen
> 2. hotel rooms in the short run, hotel rooms in the long run
> 3. groceries, meals at fancy restaurants
>
> - solution: {{For 1, sunscreen has less substitutes, so its demand is more elastic, thus its deadweight loss due to tax would be higher. For 2, price elasticities of both supply and demand curves are more elastic in the long run, thus the deadweight loss in the long run would be higher. For 3, groceries are necessary goods while meals at fancy restaurants are luxury goods, so the latter is more elastic, thus its deadweight loss would be higher.}} <!--SR:!2024-11-10,3,301-->

### waste charging

See [Hong Kong's waste problem: what is the new charging scheme and how can it clean up the issue?](https://sc.mp/y4w9).

> Q1. How would waste charging based on the amount of waste work?
>
> - solution: {{It increases the marginal cost of disposing waste from zero to a nonzero positive number. As a result, the marginal utility curve of disposing waste meets its marginal cost curve earlier, assuming the law of decreasing marginal utility holds. A rational person would dispose less waste.}} <!--SR:!2024-12-16,60,310-->

<!-- markdownlint MD028 -->

> Q2. How would waste charging by imposing a fixed fee work?
>
> - solution: {{It would not work. It does not increase the marginal cost of disposing waste from zero. As a result, unless the total utility of disposing waste does not exceed the initial fixed fee, a rational person would pay the fixed fee and still dispose as much as before.}} <!--SR:!2024-12-16,60,310-->

<!-- markdownlint MD028 -->

> Q3. What could the problems with a waste charging scheme?
>
> - solution (for reference): {{Environmentally, perhaps the designated waste bags are not biodegradable. They may add to the waste instead. Operationally, it requires a lot of setup and the cooperation of citizens to implement. Socially, citizens may not like the charge and become discontent. There are many more unmentioned here...}} <!--SR:!2024-12-03,47,290-->

<!-- markdownlint MD028 -->

> Q4. What can the Hong Kong government do to ensure successful implementation of the waste charging scheme?
>
> - solution (for reference): {{Introduce legislation against over-packaging and disposable utensils. Redesign public rubbish bins to discourage citizens from disposing their waste there to avoid the charge. Increase effort on education and enforcement. There are many more unmentioned here...}} <!--SR:!2024-11-20,34,290-->
