      content: 'We deduct the score a little because:


        1. We cannot find the final report. Only one file containing some basic database
        design. However, we cannot find the required 8-10 page report.


        2. No child link and parent links are displayed in the demonstration video


        3. The project codee structure is hard to read and the comments are not comprehensive
        enough. Additionaly, there are some code files with hard-to-read names'
