## assessments

- final exam
  - report
    - Used async iteration instead of sync iteration as required...
      - async iteration, sync iteration ::@:: A single-character difference matters... <!--SR:!2025-02-02,64,310!2025-01-30,63,310-->
    - When drawing the interpolated graph, they also wanted the old graph as dotted line... Obviously, most missed it, so it was actually fine.
      - interpolated graph format ::@:: Ideally, copy the format from the lecture slides. <!--SR:!2025-09-13,236,330!2025-10-01,251,330-->
    - There is a special rule for click > ??? (forgot), which was not mentioned on the slides but on their videos. Whatever, they added the 1 mark back.
    - Yeah, only the final exam can differentiate students...
