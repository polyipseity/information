### content

- rating: A

The course helps you discover yourself and prepares you for landing a job offer. The content seems to be the same as SCIE 1100.

You can expect to learn about the whole process of finding a job:

- knowing thyself
- presenting yourself
- interacting with others professionally
- interviewing and other things you may encounter in a recruitment center

For some lessons, there are special activities. The most significant ones are in week 8, week 10, and week 12. For week 8, we conversated with several invited professionals about their work and experience while enjoying meals. For week 10, we had group activities. In this semester, the major activities were building a catapult in a short amount of time and pretending to be mangement in a business case. For week 12, we had an almost real interview except that you don't get a job and the interviewer would say whether they will hire you. Failing this interview won't fail your course, so no need to stress about it.

### teaching

- rating: A

Compared to other courses, it is a relatively interesting one. You can still get bored in class but definitely not as much as others. (The music on class is quite relaxing...)

Grace is the main instructor and there are several TAs. They are very qualified to help you with your career. The instructor and TAs are friendly and interact with students freqently by asking questions. There are many group activities to talk with classmates.

You can also book 1-to-1 career consultation with Grace or the TAs for free.

### grading

- rating: A

It is a DI/PA/F course so it is not accounted into your GPA. It is easy to pass it. If you want to fail, you need to do one of the following:

- Having <80% attendance
- Skipping mandatory lessons
- Not doing homework on time
- Not participating at all on classes

No scores were released. I got PA at last. But who cares! It doesn't count towards your CGA.

weightings

- assignment 1: 20%
- assignment ?: ??%
- assignment 2: 20%
- participation: 10%
- attendance: 50% (So it is very important to attend all lessons!!!)

grades

- distinction: >=90%
- pass: >=60%

### workload

- rating: A

Only 1 110-minute lesson per week. There may be tasks to do after class. The tasks are not something you need to burn midnight oil or brainpower on to complete though. So the only tough workload is attending the lessons, which is difficult for some people.
