## number of routes in a grid with marked segments (with the inclusion–exclusion principle)

>
> grid with marked segments

How many paths {@{do not go through any of the marked segments}@}?

- strategy ::@:: Define the subsets $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$ to be the paths that at least pass through a marked segment for each marked segment. Then the inclusion–exclusion principle may be applied to find the number of paths that are in none of the subsets above, which is the answer we desire.

## number of prime numbers less than 50

How many {@{prime numbers are less than 50}@}?

- strategy ::@:: The prime numbers that are relevant for this question must not exceed $\lfloor \sqrt 50 \rfloor = 7$. Then define the subsets $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$ to be the set of numbers divisible by respectively 2, 3, 5, 7. The inclusion–exclusion principle may then be applied to said subsets.

## integer sum with constraints

Find the number of integer solutions to {@{$$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 10$$ subject to the following constraints $$0 \le x_1 \le 5, 0 \le x_2 \le 8, 0 \le x_3 \le 7$$}@}.

- strategy ::@:: Define the subsets $A_1, A_2, A_3$ to be the number of integers violating each of the constraint above. The inclusion–exclusion principle may then be applied to said subsets. <p> Additionally, observe that two or more constraints cannot be violated at the same time to save work.

## number of routes in a grid with marked segments (with generalized inclusion–exclusion principle)

How many paths {@{pass through exactly 3 marked paths}@}?

- strategy ::@:: Define the subsets $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$ to be the paths that at least pass through a marked segment for each marked segment. Then the _generalized_ inclusion–exclusion principle may be applied to find the number of paths that are in exactly 3 of the subsets above, which is the answer we desire. <p> Additionally, observe that no paths can pass through all 4 marked segments to save work.

## derangement and fixed points (with generalized inclusion–exclusion principle)

What is the {@{number of permutations of _n_ elements with exactly _k_ ≤ _n_ fixed points, i.e. exactly _k_ elements are mapped to their original positions}@}? (You are NOT allowed to use the number of derangements of _n_ elements.)

- strategy ::@:: Define the subsets $A_1, \ldots, A_n$. An arrangement is in $A_i$ if the $i$-th element is in its own place (a fixed point). Then apply the _generalized_ inclusion–exclusion principle to find the number of permutations of _n_ elements with exactly _k_ fixed points.
