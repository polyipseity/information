## derangement (without the inclusion–exclusion principle)

What is the {@{number of derangement of _n_ elements}@} without {@{using the inclusion–exclusion principle}@}? <!--SR:!2028-06-03,950,330!2026-03-27,121,393-->

- strategy ::@:: Derive a recurrence relation. <!--SR:!2028-03-13,891,330!2029-02-08,1224,350-->
- solution ::@:: Let $d_n$ be the number of derangement of _n_ elements. As we have derived before, $d_n = (n - 1) (d_{n - 1} + d_{n - 2})$. The base cases are $d_0 = 1$ and $d_1 = 0$. <!--SR:!2029-02-09,1226,350!2027-11-25,850,330-->

## derangement and fixed points (without the inclusion–exclusion principle)

What is the {@{number of permutations of _n_ elements with exactly _k_ ≤ _n_ fixed points}@}, i.e. {@{exactly _k_ elements are mapped to their original positions}@}? \(You are allowed to use {@{the number of derangements of _n_ elements, denoted $d_n$}@}.\) <!--SR:!2029-03-21,1256,350!2027-08-17,548,405!2027-08-18,549,405-->

- strategy ::@:: Consider the fixed points. Then consider the situation after removing the fixed points. <!--SR:!2029-04-15,1277,350!2029-04-08,1272,350-->
- solution ::@:: Choose _k_ from _n_ elements to serve as the fixed points. Then the remaining _n_ − _k_ elements is a derangement to ensure there are no additional fixed points. So the answer is $$\binom n k d_{n - k} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2029-02-02,1219,350!2029-04-22,1283,350-->

## number of onto functions (without the inclusion–exclusion principle)

How many {@{onto functions \(every element in the co-domain has at least one element in the domain mapped to it\)}@} are there from {@{a domain of _n_ elements to a co-domain of _m_ elements}@}? \(No need to {@{care about base cases}@}.\) <!--SR:!2029-04-07,1271,350!2027-07-13,519,405!2027-06-20,499,405-->

- strategy ::@:: Without the inclusion–exclusion principle, we would usually try to find recurrence relations. When considering recurrence relations, we try to find how the additional or removal of an element would preserve the property we desire (in this case, onto functions). In this case, we can add/remove an element in the domain, in the co-domain, or reinterpret the problem. <!--SR:!2028-03-22,899,330!2027-12-05,860,330-->
- solution
  - solution / induction on domain ::@:: Define $O(n, m)$ as the number of onto functions from _n_ elements to _m_ elements. <p> Consider removing the last element in the domain. There are _m_ possible elements in the co-domain said element can map to. <p> If it is the only element in the domain that maps to its corresponding element in the co-domain, then said element in the co-domain must also be removed to preserve its onto-ness. Otherwise, the function is still onto. <p> Finally, this gives the recurrence relation: $$O(n, m) = m( O(n - 1, m - 1) + O(n - 1, m) ) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2028-09-08,1060,310!2029-03-25,1176,310-->
  - solution / induction on co-domain ::@:: Define $O(n, m)$ as the number of onto functions from _n_ elements to _m_ elements. <p> Consider removing the last element in the co-domain. There are _j_, which can range from 1 to _n_ (_n_ − (_m_ − 1) is also okay), possible elements in the domain said element can be mapped from. <p> After removing the element in the co-domain, the function must still be onto. However, the _j_ elements in the domain also needs to be removed. <p> Finally, this gives the recurrence relation: $$\begin{aligned} O(n, m) & = \sum_{j = 1}^n \binom n j O(n - j, m - 1) \\ & = \sum_{j = 1}^{n - m + 1} \binom n j O(n - j, m - 1) && O(a, b) = 0\text{ if }a < b \,. \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2026-05-12,377,290!2027-06-14,691,290-->
  - solution / reinterpretation ::@:: Define $O(n, m)$ as the number of onto functions from _n_ elements to _m_ elements. <p> We can reinterpret this problem. We can treat this is the number of ways to partition _n_ elements into _m_ distinct boxes such that all boxes are non-empty. <p> However, it is easier to consider _m_ unlabeled boxes. (This actually is simply the Stirling number of the second kind $\begin{bmatrix} n \\ m \end{bmatrix}$). Consider removing an element. The element may either be in a box with itself only or a box with other elements. So its recurrence relation is given by: $$\begin{bmatrix} n \\ m \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} n - 1 \\ m - 1 \end{bmatrix} + m \begin{bmatrix} n - 1 \\ m \end{bmatrix} \,.$$ <p> Now, to turn this into our problem, simply notice that we are make the unlabeled boxes distinct (labelled) by multiplying _m_!, which is the number of ways to label the _m_ unlabelled boxes. So the final answer is: $$O(n, m) = m! \begin{bmatrix} n \\ m \end{bmatrix} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2028-01-17,875,310!2028-06-09,876,290-->

## number of routes in a grid with marked segments (without the inclusion–exclusion principle)

> ![grid with marked segments](attachments/2024-09-23%20lecture%20grid.png)
>
> grid with marked segments

How many paths {@{do not go through any of the marked segments}@}? How many paths {@{go through exactly 2 of the marked segments}@}? \({@{A recurrence relation}@} is accepted.\) <!--SR:!2029-02-21,1236,350!2029-04-23,1284,350!2026-03-27,121,393-->

- strategy
  - strategy / no marked segments ::@:: We can assign the each point with a number. The number represents the number of paths from the starting point to that point. This number can be calculated recursively: the starting point has the number 1; all other points have the number that is the sum of the number of the point to the immediate left (if any) and the number of the point to the immediate bottom (if any). <p> If a marked segment is marked, then treat it as nonexistent when finding the point to the immediate left or bottom. <p> We can represent the number each point is assigned with using functions. For example, $a(i, j)$. We can also represent if a segment is marked using another function. Then use said functions to write the recurrence relation. <!--SR:!2029-02-14,1230,350!2028-03-18,895,330-->
  - strategy / exactly 2 marked segments ::@:: Now the function also needs to consider the number of marked segments a path has passed through. That is, $a(i, j)$, which originally only represents the number of paths to $(i, j)$ without passing through any marked segments, needs to become $a(i, j, k)$, which represents the number of paths to $(i, j)$ passing through exactly $k$ marked segments. <p> Then we can use said functions to write the recurrence relation again. <!--SR:!2028-02-03,906,330!2029-03-29,1263,350-->

## inclusion–exclusion principle: warmup questions

Trivial.

1. divisible by 5 ::@:: How many natural numbers not greater than 1000 are divisible by 5? <!--SR:!2029-04-14,1276,350!2026-09-10,511,310-->
2. divisible by 2 ::@:: How many natural numbers not greater than 1000 are divisible by 2? <!--SR:!2029-04-11,1274,350!2029-05-23,1305,350-->
3. divisible by both 2 and 5 ::@:: How many natural numbers not greater than 1000 are divisible by both 2 and 5? <!--SR:!2029-05-22,1305,350!2029-05-16,1300,350-->
4. divisible by either 2 or 5 ::@:: How many natural numbers not greater than 1000 are divisible by either 2 or 5? <!--SR:!2026-12-14,598,330!2029-02-10,1226,350-->
5. divisible by either 2, 5, or 7 ::@:: How many natural numbers not greater than 7000 are divisible by either 2, 5, or 7? <!--SR:!2026-12-09,594,330!2029-02-23,1237,350-->

## inclusion–exclusion principle: proof

Prove the inclusion–exclusion principle (using binomial coefficients).

- strategy ::@:: Consider the membership of a fixed element, i.e. the sets an element belongs to. Show that the fixed element is counted once and once only by the inclusion–exclusion principle. <!--SR:!2029-02-15,1231,350!2029-04-15,1274,350-->

## derangement (with the inclusion–exclusion principle)

What is the {@{number of derangement of _n_ elements without using the inclusion–exclusion principle}@}? (A closed expression is required.) <!--SR:!2029-02-14,1229,350-->

- strategy ::@:: Find ways to define sets from properties. <p> Let there be _n_ elements. Consider the set of all possible arrangements. Define _n_ subsets, $A_1, \ldots A_n$. An arrangement belongs to $A_i$ if the _i_-th element belongs to the _i_-th place. Then derangements are arrangements that belong to none of the subsets. The inclusion–exclusion principle can be applied to get a closed expression. <!--SR:!2029-04-12,1275,350!2026-12-10,596,330-->
- number of derangements ::@:: This is known as a derangement. The number of derangements of _n_ distinct elements is also known as the subfactorial of _n_, !_n_, which is related to the factorial of _n_, _n_!, by $$!n = \begin{cases}1 \,, & n = 0 \\ \lfloor n! / e \rceil \,, & n > 0 && \lfloor * \rceil\text{ denotes the nearest integer} \,. \end{cases}$$ <p> The inclusion–exclusion principle can give us a closed expression that is a truncation of the Maclaurin series of $e^{-1}$. As _n_ approaches infinity, the expression approaches $e^{-1}$. This is why dividing by _e_ and rounding to the nearest integer works. <!--SR:!2028-06-08,954,330!2029-02-08,1225,350-->

## number of onto functions (with the inclusion–exclusion principle)

How many {@{onto functions (every element in the co-domain has at least one element in the domain mapped to it) are there from a domain of _n_ elements to a co-domain of _m_ elements}@}? (A closed expression is required.) <!--SR:!2028-03-21,898,330-->

- strategy ::@:: With the inclusion–exclusion principle, we find ways to define sets from properties. <p> Let there be _m_ elements in the co-domain. Consider the set of all possible functions from the domain to the co-domain. Define _m_ subsets, $A_1, \ldots A_m$. A function belongs to $A_i$ if the _i_-th element in the co-domain is missed by the function (and thus the function is not onto). Then onto functions are functions that belong to none of the subsets. The inclusion–exclusion principle can be applied to get a closed expression. <!--SR:!2029-03-14,1250,350!2026-05-21,427,310-->
