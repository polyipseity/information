# questions on 2024-09-16 tutorial

## arrangement of _n_ people in _r_ circles with forbidden positions (without summation)

How many ways are there to {@{arrange _n_ people in _r_ circles if person 1 and 2 cannot be next to each other, where _n_ ≥ 2 and _r_ ≥ 1}@}? ($s(n, r)$ from previous questions may be used. The solution does not use summation.) <!--SR:!2026-10-01,530,310-->

- strategy ::@:: Use the exclusion principle. Treat person 1 and 2 as 1 person. Beware of the case _n_ = 2. <!--SR:!2028-03-20,939,330!2025-11-27,311,330-->

<!-- list separator -->

- solution ::@:: There are $s(n, r)$ ways to arrange _n_ people in _r_ circles. <p> Now, we find the number of arrangements with person 1 and 2 next to each other to exclude them. Treat person 1 and 2 as 1 person. Note that there are 2 ways to treat them as 1 person: person 1 is on the left or right of person 2. Then there are $2 s(n - 1, r)$ such arrangements. <p> However, if there is 1 circle that consists of person 1 and person 2 only, then there is actually only 1 way to treat them as 1 person without double counting. So we need to add back $s(n - 2, r - 1)$ to compensate for this. (This is reminiscent of the special case _n_ = 2 when _r_ = 1 in the previous question.) <p> So the final answer is: $$\tilde s(n, r) = s(n, r) - 2 s(n - 1, r) + s(n - 2, r - 1) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-12-12,271,270!2027-07-13,685,310-->

## permutations with forbidden positions (even more problems)

There are 9 girls and 73 boys in our class of 82 students. <!-- Gender inequality... --> How many {@{permutations exist, given the following restrictions}@}: <!--SR:!2028-01-27,916,330-->

1. No 2 girls are together. (Try to not use recurrence relations.)
2. No 3 girls are together. (Recurrence relations are accepted, but consider splitting the girls into blocks. No need to care about base cases for now.)

- strategy ::@:: Be very familiar with permutations and choices. Consider splitting up the girls into blocks. <!--SR:!2025-12-02,316,330!2025-11-25,312,330-->
  - strategy / restriction 1: no 2 girls are together ::@:: We can order the 73 boys first, and then there are 74 slots for the girls. <!--SR:!2028-04-08,952,330!2025-11-25,312,330-->
  - strategy / restriction 2: no 3 girls are together ::@:: Consider the number of ways of to split up _n_ girls into _t_ blocks of 1 or 2. Denote this by a function. Write the the number of ways, making use of this function. <!--SR:!2025-12-01,263,270!2025-10-29,288,330-->

<!-- list separator -->

- solution
  - solution / restriction 1: no 2 girls are together ::@:: Order the 73 boys first. There are 74 slots for the girls. But keep in mind the order of the 9 girls matter. Therefore, $$73! \binom {74} {9} 9! \,.$$ <!--SR:!2028-02-05,907,330!2027-08-01,698,310-->
  - solution / restriction 2: no 3 girls are together ::@:: Let $\alpha(n, t)$ be the number of ways to split up _n_ girls into _t_ blocks, assuming the _n_ girls are the same but the _t_ blocks are distinct. Then it is given by (infer the base cases yourself): $$\alpha(n, t) = \alpha(n - 2, t - 1) + \alpha(n - 1, t - 1) \,.$$ <p> Now consider how many blocks of girls can we make. We can make at least 5 blocks of girls and at most 9 blocks of girls. So the answer is given by: $$\sum_{t = 5}^9 73! \binom {74} t \alpha(9, t) 9!\,.$$ <p> (Note: This final sum is tricky to get right... And even harder to intuitively justify it is right... As always, think of two questions: Does it count everything (completeness)? Does it not double count anything (exclusivity)?) <!--SR:!2025-12-08,268,270!2026-12-05,498,270-->

## number of routes in a grid (stars and bars)

How many {@{routes are there in a _n_-by-_m_ grid from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner, assuming we can only either walk up or right}@}? (Use the method of stars and bars.) <!--SR:!2025-10-31,290,330-->

- strategy ::@:: Consider the invariants of a route. In particular, the invariant is the number of upward walks, rightward walks, and the total number of walks. Then reinterpret it as a partition... <!--SR:!2025-11-30,314,330!2025-11-25,312,330-->

<!-- list separator -->

- solution ::@:: Without loss of generality, assume _n_ is the vertical height of the grid. <p> Any route from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner in a _n_-by-_m_ grid must involve _n_ upward walks, _m_ rightward walks, and _n_ + _m_ total walks. Also, the route is uniquely determined by its sequence of upward and rightward walks. <p> Consider such a sequence. Consider the sequence is partitioned by _n_ upward walks, which are the _n_ walls. Then the stars are the _m_ rightward walks. So the answer is: $$\left( \!\! \binom {n + 1} m \!\! \right) = \binom {n + m} m \,.$$ Alternatively, consider the sequence partitioned by _m_ rightward walks, which are the _m_ walls. Then the stars are the _n_ upward walks. So the answer is: $$\left( \!\! \binom {m + 1} n \!\! \right) = \binom {m + n} n \,.$$ Both yields the same answer, as expected. <!--SR:!2028-05-24,941,330!2025-10-30,289,330-->

## number of routes in a grid with special points and lines

> grid with special points and lines

Consider the above grid. Find {@{the number of routes with the following restrictions}@}: <!--SR:!2028-04-03,948,330-->

1. How many paths do not visit the red point?
2. How many paths do not visit the two yellow points? How many paths visit one yellow point exactly?
3. How many paths cross the dotted line?

- strategy ::@:: Use the exclusion principle. Sometimes, note that there are no intersections between two cases. In general, the inclusion–exclusion principle can be used (not needed here). Sometimes, considering the complementary paths helps. <!--SR:!2027-01-29,613,310!2027-01-17,601,310-->
  - strategy / restriction: no red point ::@:: Simply subtract the number of paths passing through the red point. To find the number of paths passing through the red point, multiply the number of paths from the starting point to the red point by the number of paths from the red point to the ending point. <!--SR:!2025-11-02,292,330!2028-01-16,905,330-->
  - strategy / restriction: yellow points ::@:: Notice that no paths can pass through two yellow points at the same time. So proceed as usual like that for the red point. <!--SR:!2028-02-08,909,330!2028-01-01,893,330-->
  - strategy / restriction: dotted line ::@:: We can assign the each point with a number. The number represents the number of paths from the starting point to that point. This number can be calculated recursively: the starting point has the number 1; all other points have the number that is the sum of the number of the point to the immediate left (if any) and the number of the point to the immediate bottom (if any). <p> Also, the question is easier if you subtract the paths not crossing the dotted line (complementary paths) instead of finding the number of paths crossing the dotted line. <!--SR:!2025-11-25,312,330!2026-08-03,434,290-->

## permutations with ordering

How many orders can a spider, which has 8 legs, put on socks and shoes such that {@{all socks are before shoes for each leg}@}? <!--SR:!2025-12-01,315,330-->

- strategy ::@:: First, label the socks and shoes with mathematical symbols. Then, notice the symmetry in this question... For example, what if the question says "put on socks and shoes such that all shoes are before socks for each leg"? Such symmetry hints at division... <!--SR:!2028-03-15,935,330!2025-11-28,312,330-->

<!-- list separator -->

- solution
  - solution / distinguished labeling ::@:: Label the 8 socks $s_i$, which represents wearing a sock onto the leg _i_, and the 8 shoes $r_i$, which represents wearing a shoe onto the leg _i_. There are $16!$ ways to order them into a sequence if we ignore the restrictions. <p> Now consider an arbitrary sequence and an arbitrary leg _i_. Either $s_i$ comes before $r_i$ or $r_i$ comes before $s_i$. The number of sequences with the first property is the same as the number of sequences with the second property. (It is easy to construct a bijection for this.) This is the same case for all other legs. So divide the number of permutations by $2^8$. <p> Finally, the answer is $$\frac {16!} {2^8} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2027-01-27,611,310!2027-02-13,623,310-->
  - solution / undistinguished labeling ::@:: Label the 8 socks $s_i$, which represents wearing a sock onto the leg _i_, and the 8 shoes _also_ $s_i$, which represents wearing a shoe onto the leg _i_. Notice we now have two $s_i$ for each _i_. There are $16!$ ways to order them into a sequence if we treat the 16 $s$ as distinct. <p> Now, we want to respect the restriction. This is easy: simply assign the $s_i$ that comes first as the sock. So we just divide the number of permutations by $(2!)^8$. <p> Finally, the answer is $$\frac {16!} {(2!)^8} = \frac {16!} {2^8} \,,$$ same as above. <!--SR:!2028-04-20,962,330!2028-03-26,944,330-->

## number of divisors

How many {@{divisors does an arbitrary number have}@}? How many {@{common divisors do two arbitrary numbers have}@}? <!--SR:!2025-11-24,311,330!2029-05-19,1300,350-->

- strategy ::@:: Decompose the numbers into their unique product of prime factors and exponents. Then consider the number of choices for each exponent of each prime factor for the divisors. <!--SR:!2025-11-25,312,330!2025-11-25,312,330-->
  - strategy / number of divisors ::@:: For each prime factor _p_ and its exponent _e_, there are _e_ + 1 choices for the divisor. <!--SR:!2025-10-28,287,330!2025-11-01,291,330-->
  - strategy / number of common divisors of two numbers ::@:: A common divisor must have, for each of its prime factor _p_ and its exponent _e_, the exponent is not greater than the exponents of both numbers' corresponding prime factor. <!--SR:!2026-08-18,444,290!2025-11-29,313,330-->
