Is it possible to {{start from a vertex, go through every bridge exactly once, and then go back to the original vertex}}? <!--SR:!2024-10-21,4,270-->

- solution ::: No. If such a cycle exist, consider the starting/ending vertex and all other visited vertices. The degree of the starting/ending vertex must be even. The degrees of other visited vertex must also be even. But one of the vertex has an odd degree, so such a cycle must not exist. <!--SR:!2024-10-21,4,270!2024-10-21,4,270-->
