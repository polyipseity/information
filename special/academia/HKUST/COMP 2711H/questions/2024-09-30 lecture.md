Is it possible to {@{start from a vertex, go through every bridge exactly once, and then go back to the original vertex}@}? <!--SR:!2028-12-26,1188,350-->

- solution ::@:: No. If such a cycle exist, consider the starting/ending vertex and all other visited vertices. The degree of the starting/ending vertex must be even. The degrees of other visited vertex must also be even. But one of the vertex has an odd degree, so such a cycle must not exist. <!--SR:!2029-04-06,1269,350!2025-10-26,287,330-->
