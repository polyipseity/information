# Java recursion

Recursion is all about {{reducing any problem to a simpler similar problem,  repeating this process until you get several base problems that are irreducible}}.

Usually, we {{do not use recursion}} in Java. But if it is required, it is as simple as {{conditionally calling the method itself in a method and adding base cases to the method}}. For example, a recursive way to reverse a string:

```Java
public static String reverse(String input) {
  if (input.length() <= 1) return input; // base case
  return reverse(input.substring(1)) + input.charAt(0); // call the method itself
}
```
