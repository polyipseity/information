# Java

Java is {@{a programming language created in 1995 by Sun Microsystems}@}. It was designed with two focuses: {@{portability, so that you can write one run anywhere; and object-oriented, implemented by making almost everything objects}@}.

## development

Java is {@{an interpreted language}@}. This means {@{an interpreter runs the program}@}. In contrast, {@{in a compiled language, a compiler compiles the source into a binary, which is understood by the platform natively}@}. The former languages {@{are _generally_ highly portable and flexible but less efficient}@}, and the latter languages are opposite. For Java, {@{a compiler turns the source into an intermediate form called Java bytecode to maintain portability and increase efficiency, and then the bytecode is run by an interpreter}@}.

To develop Java, one needs {@{the Java Development Kit (JDK)}@}. This courses also uses an IDE called {@{[BlueJ](BlueJ.md), which comes bundled with the JDK. It is available on <https://bluej.org/>}@}.
