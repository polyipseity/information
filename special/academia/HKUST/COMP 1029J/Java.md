# Java

Java is {{a programming language created in 1995 by Sun Microsystems}}. It was designed with two focuses: {{portability, so that you can write one run anywhere; and object-oriented, implemented by making almost everything objects}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-23,31,290!2024-11-03,194,310-->

## development

Java is {{an interpreted language}}. This means {{an interpreter runs the program}}. In contrast, {{in a compiled language, a compiler compiles the source into a binary, which is understood by the platform natively}}. The former languages {{are _generally_ highly portable and flexible but less efficient}}, and the latter languages are opposite. For Java, {{a compiler turns the source into an intermediate form called Java bytecode to maintain portability and increase efficiency, and then the bytecode is run by an interpreter}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-01,217,310!2024-09-06,151,310!2024-05-01,70,310!2024-09-12,162,310!2025-02-19,295,330-->

To develop Java, one needs {{the Java Development Kit (JDK)}}. This courses also uses an IDE called {{[BlueJ](BlueJ.md), which comes bundled with the JDK. It is available on <https://bluej.org/>}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-24,190,310!2025-01-21,273,330-->
