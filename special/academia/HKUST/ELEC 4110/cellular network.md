# cellular network

- see: [general/cellular network](../../../../general/cellular%20network.md)

{@{A __cellular network__}@} is {@{a radio communication system in which the coverage area of a mobile operator is divided into multiple cells}@}, each served by {@{its own base station}@}. The design allows {@{frequency reuse across non‑adjacent cells}@}, thereby {@{increasing spectral efficiency}@} while {@{limiting interference}@}. {@{Key operational aspects}@} include {@{handover procedures}@} to {@{maintain continuous service as users move between cells}@} and {@{sophisticated cell planning}@} to {@{balance coverage and capacity}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-28,14,292!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

## history

{@{A quick historical recap}@}: {@{wireless telegraph (1896)}@}, {@{early NYC wireless voice (1920s)}@}, {@{first‑generation mobile phones (~1980s)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303-->

The {@{origins of mobile telephony}@} trace back to {@{Guglielmo Marconi's 1896 wireless‑telegraphy experiments}@}, which demonstrated that {@{messages could be transmitted over long distances without wires}@} and set {@{the stage for future voice transmission}@}. In the {@{early twentieth century}@}, engineers began {@{experimenting with wireless telephony}@}, proving that {@{human speech could be carried by radio waves across city‑wide networks}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

The {@{first commercially available mobile phone emerged in 1973}@}, yet it was {@{hampered by a critical limitation}@}: {@{CDMA capacity grows with spreading factor}@}, which is {@{tied to bandwidth}@}—yet the {@{finite radio spectrum}@} cannot {@{realistically expand thousands of times}@}, so could {@{support only a handful of users at any one time}@}, making {@{widespread use impractical}@}. This {@{capacity bottleneck}@} became the {@{central challenge for mobile systems}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-28,14,295!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,295!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

{@{Bell Labs}@} addressed the problem with the {@{invention of cellular architecture}@}, which {@{divided geographic areas into small cells}@} that {@{reused the same frequency bands in a controlled manner}@}. By enabling {@{spatial frequency reuse}@}, {@{cellular design}@} transformed {@{limited spectrum into scalable capacity}@}, paving the way for the {@{modern mobile phone era}@}. {@{Economically}@}, {@{CAPEX rises linearly with the number of sites}@}—each {@{macro‑cell costs roughly $300k}@}—while {@{OPEX (power, rental/real‑estate fees and utilities)}@} also {@{scales with site count}@}. The {@{additional revenue generated by attracting more subscribers through increased capacity}@} offsets these {@{higher CAPEX and OPEX}@}, making the {@{investment economically justified}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

## architecture

{@{Mobile users}@} connect to {@{the _Base Transceiver Station (BTS)_}@} via {@{radio}@}. {@{Several BTSs}@} are linked {@{through a _Backhaul_ to a _Base Station Controller (BSC)_}@}; {@{multiple BSCs}@} forward {@{traffic to the core, the _Mobile Switching Center (MSC)_}@}.   {@{The MSC}@} interfaces with the {@{_Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)_}@} for {@{voice and the Internet for data}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-29,15,303-->

The {@{_BSC–MSC backhaul_}@} is {@{typically the capacity limiter}@}: all {@{BTS‑to‑core traffic}@} must {@{pass through it}@}, so its {@{bandwidth often caps overall system throughput}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

## principles

{@{Cellular systems}@} are designed to {@{make the most efficient use of a limited radio spectrum}@} by {@{partitioning geographic coverage into many _cells_}@} and {@{reusing the same frequencies in non‑overlapping cells}@}.  The {@{core idea}@} is that a {@{signal's power falls off with distance (path loss)}@}, so {@{two transmitters using the same channel}@} can operate {@{without interfering if they are far enough apart}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

When {@{no reuse is employed}@}, {@{all $N$ channels}@} are divided into {@{$B$ distinct sets}@} and {@{each set serves a single cell}@}; the {@{total capacity equals $(N/B)\times B = N$}@}.  This arrangement {@{guarantees excellent signal quality}@} because {@{no two users share a channel}@}, but it {@{yields poor overall system capacity}@} because only {@{$B$ cells can exist}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,300!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303-->

To {@{improve capacity}@}, cellular architectures adopt a {@{flexible resource‑reuse scheme}@}.  By selecting an appropriate {@{_frequency reuse factor_ $K$}@}, i.e. the {@{number of sets the channels are divided into}@}, the network can {@{balance the trade‑off between interference and bandwidth utilization}@}: {@{larger $K$}@} reduces {@{interference but limits capacity}@}, whereas {@{smaller $K$}@} increases {@{capacity at the cost of higher co‑channel interference}@}.  The {@{design challenge}@} is to {@{space co‑channel cells sufficiently far apart}@} so that their {@{attenuated signals do not degrade quality}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

### frequency reuse

In  {@{cellular networks}@} the {@{same frequency spectrum}@} is used by {@{multiple cells that are sufficiently far apart}@} so as to {@{limit mutual interference}@}.  The {@{set of frequencies assigned to a group of non‑adjacent cells}@} is called a {@{_reuse pattern_}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-29,15,303-->

If the {@{total available bandwidth}@} can be divided into {@{$K$ disjoint sets}@}, the {@{_frequency reuse factor_ (or simply "reuse factor")}@} is defined as {@{$$K \;=\; \frac{\text{total number of frequency channels} }{\text{channels per base station} } \,.$$}@} A {@{smaller $K$}@} (e.g., 4 or 7) means a {@{more aggressive reuse}@}: each {@{base station uses a larger fraction of the spectrum}@}, yielding {@{higher capacity per unit area}@} but also {@{higher co‑channel interference}@}. A {@{larger $K$}@} reduces {@{interference at the cost of spectral efficiency}@}. The {@{total network capacity}@} scales with the {@{number of base stations $N_{\mathrm{BS} }$}@} as {@{$$C_{\text{tot} } = \frac{N_{\mathrm{ch} } }{K}\; N_{\mathrm{BS} } \,,$$}@} so the {@{slope of the capacity‑versus‑$N_{\mathrm{BS} }$ curve}@} is {@{proportional to $1/K$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-24,10,283!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->  

Choosing an {@{optimal $K$}@} requires {@{balancing two extremes}@}: when {@{reuse is 1}@}, there is {@{maximal spectral use}@} but {@{intolerable interference}@}; when {@{no reuse (each cell gets a unique set)}@}, there is {@{zero interference}@} but {@{no capacity scaling}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

The {@{allowable reuse factor}@} depends on the {@{physical‑layer technology}@} and {@{propagation environment}@}. {@{Analog 1G systems}@}, which require about {@{18&nbsp;dB of signal‑to‑interference ratio (SIR)}@}, typically use {@{$K\approx7$}@}. {@{Digital GSM 2G systems}@} tolerate a {@{lower SIR (~13&nbsp;dB)}@} and can {@{safely employ $K=4$}@}. {@{Propagation characteristics}@} also influence the choice. In {@{rural or line‑of‑sight areas}@} where the {@{path‑loss exponent is close to 2}@}, interference extends farther; therefore a {@{larger reuse factor (e.g., 7)}@} is needed. In {@{dense urban settings with an exponent near 4}@}, interference decays rapidly and a {@{smaller $K$ (≈4) becomes feasible}@}. Thus, {@{frequency reuse}@} is a {@{fundamental design lever}@} that {@{trades spectral efficiency against interference tolerance}@}, guided by the {@{capabilities of the modulation/coding scheme and the surrounding terrain}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,300!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

### path loss

{@{_Path loss_}@}—{@{attenuation of radio signals with distance}@}—is a {@{double‑edged factor in cellular systems}@}. While it {@{limits the reach of individual cells}@}, making {@{coverage smaller}@}, it also {@{reduces co‑channel interference between neighbouring cells}@}, benefiting {@{capacity}@}. This {@{coverage—capacity tradeoff}@} is {@{fundamental}@}: without {@{sufficient path loss}@}, frequency reuse would be {@{impractical and mobile service could not be offered at affordable costs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,300!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

The {@{received power}@} of a transmitted signal {@{decreases with distance}@} according to a {@{_path‑loss model_}@}.  The {@{most common representation}@} is the {@{log‑distance path loss (higher means losing more power)}@}: {@{$$L(d) = L_0 + 10\,n_{\!p}\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{d}{d_0}\right) \,,$$}@} where {@{$L_0$}@} is the {@{loss at a reference distance $d_0$}@}, {@{$d$}@} is the {@{link length}@}, and {@{$n_{\!p}$}@} is the {@{_path‑loss exponent_}@}. Typical values of {@{$n_{\!p}$}@} include {@{2, 4, etc.}@} <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

- $n_p \approx 2$ – rural or line‑of‑sight environments where the signal propagates with little obstruction. ::@:: Interference from distant cells decays slowly, so a larger reuse factor (e.g., $K=7$) is required to keep co‑channel interference below acceptable limits. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303-->
- $n_p \approx 4$ – dense urban areas with many buildings and scatterers. ::@:: Signal power falls off more rapidly; consequently, the same technology can employ a smaller reuse factor (e.g., $K=4$) while still meeting signal‑to‑interference ratio (SIR) targets. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303-->

{@{The path‑loss exponent}@} directly {@{influences network planning}@}: it {@{determines how aggressively frequency resources can be reused}@} and thus {@{shapes cell size, base‑station density, and overall capacity}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

## handover

In {@{cellular networks}@}, {@{_handover_ (also called _handoff_}@}) is the {@{procedure by which a mobile device transfers an ongoing call or data session from one base‑station cell to another while maintaining service continuity}@}. The process requires {@{signalling between the mobile and both the current and target cells}@} to establish {@{a new radio link before tearing down the old one}@}. {@{Successful handover}@} depends on several factors: the {@{speed of the mobile, the geometry of the cell layout}@}, the {@{timing of the signalling protocol, and the capabilities of the network equipment}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

{@{High mobility}@} can make {@{handover challenging}@} because the {@{time window in which the device remains within a single cell}@} becomes {@{very short}@}. If the {@{signalling exchange}@} cannot be {@{completed before the device exits the coverage area of the serving base‑station}@}, the {@{call may be dropped}@}. Moreover, the {@{design of most terrestrial cellular systems}@} assumes {@{typical user speeds below 200&nbsp;km&nbsp;h⁻¹}@}; exceeding this limit can lead to {@{missed handover triggers and connection failures}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

### handover examples

Consider the example of {@{high‑speed rail}@}: {@{Trains operating at 300–400&nbsp;km&nbsp;h⁻¹}@}, such as the {@{Guangzhou‑Wuhan line}@}, already experience {@{frequent dropped calls and poor live‑streaming quality}@} because the {@{rapid crossing of cell boundaries}@} overwhelms the {@{handover signalling}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->  

Consider the example of a {@{commercial aircraft}@}: A {@{plane cruising at ~800&nbsp;km&nbsp;h⁻¹}@} is even faster, but its {@{large altitude reduces angular velocity relative to ground cells}@} (≈0.64°&nbsp;s⁻¹ at 10&nbsp;km altitude and 30° inclination). With a {@{typical macro‑cell beamwidth of ~60°}@}, the vehicle would spend {@{on the order of 100&nbsp;seconds within one cell}@}, giving {@{handover algorithms more time than on the ground}@}. Nonetheless, {@{additional challenges arise}@}: {@{reduced link budget due to antenna sidelobe reception}@} and {@{metallic shielding inside the aircraft}@}, as well as {@{Doppler shift (≈2&nbsp;kHz at 2&nbsp;GHz)}@} that is still {@{manageable by modern oscillators with ~20&nbsp;kHz tolerance}@}. In practice, mobile phones may {@{receive occasional SMS or voice when near an airport}@}, but {@{reliable connectivity throughout a flight}@} remains {@{difficult and is generally disallowed under aviation regulations}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-26,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

## link budgeting

A {@{3G macro cell}@} typically transmits {@{≈20&nbsp;W (43&nbsp;dBm) total power}@}, but each {@{traffic channel receives only about 2% of that}@} (~25.4&nbsp;dBm). {@{Beamforming}@} provides {@{an additional ~17&nbsp;dBi gain}@} ({@{decibel isotropic}@}; {@{the gain of an antenna}@} compared with {@{the gain of a theoretical isotropic antenna, which uniformly distributes energy in all directions}@}) while {@{cable loss}@} {@{subtracts ~2&nbsp;dB}@}, yielding an {@{effective radiated power of ≈40.8&nbsp;dBm}@}. The {@{receiver sensitivity}@} is {@{roughly –112&nbsp;dBm}@}, and after adding a {@{7.5&nbsp;dBm safety margin}@}, giving a {@{maximum tolerable path loss of about 145&nbsp;dB}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

Using an {@{NYC‑style propagation model}@}, a {@{maximum tolerable path loss of about 145&nbsp;dB}@} translates to {@{<2&nbsp;km coverage on the ground}@}; in the air, {@{losing beamforming gain (~17&nbsp;dBi)}@} and {@{suffering ≈20&nbsp;dB penetration loss}@} reduces the {@{allowable path loss to ~100&nbsp;dB}@}, but {@{free‑space propagation (exponent≈2)}@} extends {@{the range to about 3&nbsp;km}@}. These figures illustrate how {@{distance, antenna patterns, and environmental shielding}@} influence {@{handover feasibility}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

## 1G

The {@{first generation (1G) cellular systems}@} were {@{fundamentally analog}@}, using {@{frequency‑modulated voice at 30&nbsp;kHz}@} and {@{simple digital signalling such as FSK}@}. The {@{primary design goal}@} was {@{_capacity_}@}, with {@{many incompatible standards emerging worldwide}@}—{@{_AMPS_ in the United States}@} and {@{_TACS_ in the United Kingdom}@} are typical examples. User signals were separated by {@{FDMA}@}, so the {@{number of distinct channels}@} was {@{inherently limited}@}; to maintain reliable reception {@{a signal‑to‑interference ratio of roughly $\text{SIR}\approx 18\;\text{dB}$}@} was required, and {@{frequency reuse followed a pattern with $K=7$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303-->

During the {@{_initial deployment_ phase}@} {@{coverage rather than capacity}@} {@{limited performance}@}. Networks therefore deployed {@{large macro‑cells}@} to reduce the {@{number of base stations needed}@}. As the network entered the {@{_growth stage_}@}, {@{subscriber numbers rose}@}, especially in {@{densely populated areas}@} where the {@{load could exceed a single cell's capacity}@}; operators mitigated this by {@{splitting cells or sectorising them}@}. In the {@{_mature stage_}@} the {@{bottleneck shifted back to capacity}@}: at that point {@{further engineering of the system}@} could no longer {@{increase throughput without fundamental changes to the architecture}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-29,15,303-->

## 2G

{@{Second‑generation (2G) cellular systems}@} emerged to {@{_enhance voice capacity_}@} and to use the {@{_scarce spectrum more efficiently_}@}.  The {@{new bands}@} combined {@{traditional cellular frequencies with PCS (Personal Communications Service) allocations}@}: {@{Europe/Hong&nbsp;Kong employ $900\,\text{MHz}$ for cellular and $1.8\,\text{GHz}$ for PCS}@}, whereas the {@{United States uses $800\,\text{MHz}$ for cellular and $1.9\,\text{GHz}$ for PCS}@}.  {@{Digital transmission techniques}@} were introduced to provide {@{_robustness through error‑correction coding_}@}, improving {@{immunity to noise and interference}@} while {@{lowering the K factor}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-26,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-28,14,290!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

Speech was {@{compressed digitally}@}, allowing each user to {@{occupy less bandwidth}@}—{@{Digital AMPS}@}, for instance, can fit {@{three users into a single 30&nbsp;kHz carrier}@}.  {@{Data services remained circuit‑switched}@}: the {@{air interface and its resources}@} stayed {@{dedicated to a user throughout the session}@}, yielding {@{modest speeds between 9.6&nbsp;kbps and 14.4&nbsp;kbps}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

In Europe, a {@{_revolutionary_ approach}@} was adopted: {@{all legacy 1G infrastructure}@} was {@{replaced by a unified standard—GSM}@}—because {@{existing systems were incompatible}@} and GSM quickly {@{captured over 90% of the worldwide market}@}.  The {@{United States pursued an _evolutionary_ path}@}, maintaining {@{backward compatibility with AMPS}@} through {@{Digital‑AMPS (IS&nbsp;54) and CDMA (IS&nbsp;95)}@}, reflecting the {@{large penetration of AMPS}@} and the {@{substantial domestic demand for cellular communication}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

These developments illustrate how {@{technical advances and market considerations}@} jointly shaped {@{the evolution from 1G to 2G cellular networks}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303-->

## 3G

The {@{transition from 2G to 3G}@} represented a {@{fundamental shift in how mobile networks allocate spectrum and deliver services}@}. While {@{2G systems maximised capacity}@} by improving {@{spectral efficiency}@}, 3G was driven primarily by {@{the _need for high‑speed wireless data communication_}@}. The {@{new generation}@} focused on {@{data‑centric and value‑added applications}@} such as {@{Mobile Internet Access, multimedia messaging, video telephony}@}, {@{location‑based services, and rich voice}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

In {@{3G networks}@}, the emphasis is on providing {@{seamless end‑to‑end service}@} across a {@{range of data rates}@}. This is achieved through {@{multi‑mode, multi‑media support}@} that allows an operator to deliver both {@{voice and high‑bandwidth data from the same infrastructure}@}. Typical {@{maximum data speeds}@} reach {@{_2&nbsp;Mbps_ for mobile broadband}@} while {@{legacy 3G services}@} still offer {@{_144&nbsp;kbps_ or _384&nbsp;kbps_ for narrowband applications}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,295!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

### 3G services

{@{Mobile operators}@} introduced a suite of {@{value‑added services to attract subscribers}@}: <!--SR:!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

- _Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS)_ ::@:: enabled users to send pictures, audio clips, and short video fragments. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->
- _Rich Voice_ ::@:: encompassed video telephony and combined text‑audio conversations. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303-->
- _Location Based Services (LBS)_ ::@:: leveraged GPS or network positioning to provide navigation, local search, and context‑aware advertising. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->
- _Mobile Internet Access_ ::@:: gave users worldwide connectivity for browsing, email, and early social networking. <!--SR:!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

These services were marketed as {@{_seamless_}@}—users could switch between {@{voice calls, data sessions, and multimedia streams}@} without {@{noticeable disruption}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

## 4G

The {@{leap from _3G_ to _4G_}@} was marked by a {@{dramatic increase in data rates}@} and the {@{introduction of broadband‑grade mobile services}@}. {@{3G systems}@}, standardized under {@{IMT‑2000}@}, offered {@{peak data speeds of roughly 2&nbsp;Mbps}@} and enabled {@{global roaming, high‑quality video conferencing and internet access}@} that were far beyond the {@{100&nbsp;kbps limits of earlier 2G digital networks}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

Around {@{2010 the first _LTE_ (Long Term Evolution)}@} deployments began to {@{replace or augment existing 3G infrastructure}@}. LTE pushed {@{peak rates up to 100&nbsp;Mbps}@}, providing a {@{true broadband experience on a mobile handset}@}. In {@{South Korea}@}, for example, {@{4G/LTE traffic}@} grew to account for about {@{63% of the country's monthly data volume in 2013}@}, while {@{smartphone penetration}@} climbed from {@{20% in 2010 to roughly 60% by 2012}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

This transition reshaped {@{everyday mobile usage}@}: people shifted from {@{voice‑centric services to data‑intensive applications}@} such as {@{social networking, music streaming, online gaming and video playback}@}. {@{Average daily consumption of internet‑based content}@} rose sharply, underscoring how {@{LTE's higher throughput}@} enabled a {@{new generation of rich media experiences}@} that were {@{simply impossible on earlier 3G networks}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

## 5G

{@{_5G_}@} builds on the {@{high‑bandwidth foundation of LTE}@} but redefines {@{what mobile connectivity can do}@} by making {@{_latency_ a first‑class requirement}@}.  {@{Current deployments}@} already target {@{sub‑50&nbsp;ms round‑trip times}@}, which is {@{essential for smooth VoIP and low‑delay video streaming}@}—capabilities that were {@{difficult to achieve on earlier generations}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303-->

Looking ahead, the {@{vision of a _tactile wireless network_}@} positions 5G as {@{the backbone for machine‑type communications, real‑time control loops, and immersive interactive gaming}@}.  In this future use case, {@{end‑to‑end delays must drop below _1&nbsp;ms_}@}, enabling {@{near‑instantaneous feedback between humans and machines}@}.  {@{Achieving such performance}@} will require {@{dense small‑cell deployments, massive MIMO, and ultra‑reliable low‑latency communication (URLLC) protocols}@} that can support the {@{simultaneous needs of high‑throughput data traffic and time‑critical control signals}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

### 5G implementation

{@{Implementing 5G}@} hinges on turning the {@{theoretical gains of a _higher data rates_}@} into {@{real, scalable hardware}@}.  The {@{most direct way to achieve this}@} is by deploying {@{_massive MIMO_}@}—{@{hundreds of antennas per base station}@}—so that each user can be {@{served with its own narrow beam}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-26,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303-->

However, {@{adding antennas}@} also {@{multiplies the number of RF chains}@}, which {@{drives up both cost and power consumption}@}. Another challenge is to keep the {@{_pilot training overhead_ independent of the antenna count}@} so that the system does not become {@{overwhelmed by channel estimation traffic}@}. Further, {@{intercell interference mitigation}@} requires {@{global real time channel state information (CSI)}@}, so the network architecture must support {@{_low‑latency backhaul_}@} so that coordination between {@{macro cells and dense small‑cell deployments}@} can occur in real time. {@{Advanced radio resource management algorithms}@}—{@{dynamic spectrum sharing, user‑centric scheduling, and interference coordination}@}—must therefore operate on {@{fine timescales to keep latency below a few milliseconds}@} while still {@{maximizing throughput}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

{@{Another critical design}@} leverages the {@{enormous bandwidth now available in the sub‑6&nbsp;GHz and mmWave bands}@}.  At these frequencies, {@{line‑of‑sight (LOS) propagation dominates}@}, making {@{_beamforming_ essential to overcome severe path loss}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

In practice, the combination of {@{_massive MIMO_, high‑bandwidth carriers, precise beamforming, and ultra‑low‑latency backhaul}@} creates a system that can deliver the {@{promised 1000× improvement in data rates}@}.  The {@{remaining hurdles are largely engineering}@}: minimizing {@{the cost and energy footprint of large RF arrays}@}, reducing {@{pilot overhead through clever code design}@}, and ensuring that {@{backhaul links keep pace with the rapid beamforming updates required by mmWave deployments}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303-->

## applications

{@{Video streaming on mobile devices}@} is highly sensitive to the {@{_playback queue_ dynamics}@}: a queue that {@{falls below its lower boundary}@} triggers {@{playback interruption}@}, while a queue that {@{exceeds its upper boundary}@} causes {@{buffer overflow and packet loss}@}.  An {@{radio resource management (RRM) scheme}@} that is aware of {@{Quality‑of‑Experience (QoE)}@} monitors {@{these queue trajectories in real time}@}, allocating {@{radio resources to keep the buffer within safe limits}@}.  By adjusting {@{modulation, coding and scheduling rates}@} based on {@{instantaneous queue length}@}, the system prevents {@{stalls and reduces the probability of dropped packets}@}, thereby maintaining a {@{smooth playback experience for the end user}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303-->

In {@{networked control systems}@}, {@{_control theory_}@} must be reconciled with {@{communication constraints}@} such as {@{limited capacity, variable delay, and packet loss}@}.  {@{Queueing behaviour at the link level}@} can interfere with {@{controller stability}@}: packets may {@{arrive late or be dropped}@}, degrading {@{feedback quality}@}.  Designing {@{controllers that explicitly model these network impairments}@}—using concepts like {@{bounded‑delay channels or stochastic packet loss models}@}—ensures {@{robust performance}@} even when the {@{physical plant and its sensors/actuators}@} are connected over a {@{shared wireless medium}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-29,15,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-30,16,303!2026-01-26,16,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-31,17,303!2026-01-29,15,303-->
