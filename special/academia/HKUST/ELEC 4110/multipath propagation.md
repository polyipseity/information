# multipath propagation

- see: [general/multipath propagation](../../../../general/multipath%20propagation.md)

In {@{wireless communication systems}@}, {@{the received signal strength varies}@} due to {@{several large‑scale and small‑scale propagation effects}@}. {@{The dominant mechanisms}@} are {@{_path loss_, _shadowing_, and _multipath fading_}@} (often called {@{fast or microscopic fading}@}). <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

## path loss

{@{Path loss}@} describes the {@{deterministic attenuation}@} that follows an {@{inverse‑power law with distance}@}; in {@{dense urban environments}@} {@{the path‑loss exponent can be as high as four}@}, so {@{doubling the separation}@} reduces {@{power by a factor of sixteen (≈12&nbsp;dB)}@}. {@{Shadowing}@} captures {@{random additional losses caused by obstacles such as trees or buildings}@} and is typically modeled as a {@{log‑normal variation}@} that contributes {@{an extra 8–10&nbsp;dB of contrast}@}. {@{Both phenomena}@} vary {@{slowly over seconds to minutes}@} and dominate {@{coverage planning for network operators}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

## multipath fading

{@{_Multipath fading_}@} describes the {@{rapid, small‑scale variations in received power}@} that arise when {@{several radio paths arrive at a receiver with different lengths and delays}@}. {@{The complex amplitudes of these paths}@} {@{add together}@}; if {@{their phases align}@} {@{a _constructive peak_ appears}@}, while {@{opposite phases}@} produce {@{a _destructive dip_}@}. This superposition creates {@{a time‑varying envelope}@} whose {@{dynamic range can exceed 30&nbsp;dB in typical Rayleigh channels}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

The effect is {@{most pronounced over distances on the order of a few wavelengths}@}. For example, at {@{1&nbsp;GHz (λ≈0.3&nbsp;m)}@} the wavelength is roughly {@{one foot}@}; at {@{900&nbsp;MHz}@} it is about {@{0.33&nbsp;m}@}. Because {@{the path length differences are on the order of a wavelength}@}, traversing {@{only a few centimetres}@} can move the receiver from {@{a bright spot to a deep fade}@}; at {@{2&nbsp;GHz}@} this spatial scale is about {@{7–8&nbsp;cm}@}, corresponding to {@{temporal changes on the order of milliseconds for a walking user}@}. {@{The resulting channel power gain}@} follows {@{a Rayleigh distribution}@}, exhibiting {@{roughly 40&nbsp;dB of dynamic range between peaks and nulls}@}. {@{This fast fading}@} occurs on {@{the same timescale as modern modulation symbols (≈1&nbsp;ms)}@}, making it {@{a critical consideration for physical‑layer design by handset manufacturers and vendors}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

### multipath fading model

{@{The wireless propagation environment}@} is viewed as {@{a _black‑box_}@}: we do not {@{model every scatterer or reflector explicitly}@}; instead we characterize {@{the whole medium by its _impulse response_}@}. For {@{a linear time‑variant channel}@} the relationship between {@{an input signal $x(t)$ and the received signal $y(t)$}@} is {@{$$y(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(t,\tau)\,x(t-\tau)\,d\tau ,$$}@} where {@{$h(t,\tau)$}@} is {@{_channel impulse response (CIR)_}@}, {@{$t$}@} is {@{current observation time (the channel can change with time)}@}, and {@{$\tau$}@} is {@{delay of a particular propagation path relative to the transmitter}@}. By {@{measuring or estimating $h(t,\tau)$}@}, we can predict {@{how any transmitted waveform will be distorted}@}—thus treating {@{the entire propagation medium as an abstract black box}@} defined solely by {@{its impulse response}@}. As {@{the CIR varies over time}@}, the channel is {@{linear-time variant (LTV)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

{@{The CIR}@} encapsulates {@{all multipath effects}@}: {@{each non‑zero component of $h(t,\tau)$}@} corresponds to {@{one reflected or scattered ray}@}, represented by {@{a delayed delta function weighted by its complex attenuation}@}: {@{$$h(t,\tau)=\sum_{k=1}^{K}a_k(t)\,\delta(\tau-\tau_k(t))$$}@} where {@{$a_k(t)$}@} is {@{complex time‑varying random amplitude of path $k$ (which already includes time‑varying phase shift $\theta_k(t)$)}@}, and {@{$\tau_k(t)$}@} is {@{propagation delay for path $k$}@}. Taking {@{its Fourier transform}@}, we have {@{$$H(t, f) = \sum_{k = 1}^K a_k(t) e^{-2\pi f \tau_k(t)} \,.$$}@} <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

{@{The _power delay profile_ (PDP)}@} shows the {@{average received power at a specific delay $\tau$}@}. It is obtained by {@{averaging the squared magnitude of the channel impulse response over time}@}: {@{$$P_{\text{avg} }(\tau)=\frac{1}{T}\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} |h(t,\tau)|^{2}\,dt = \sum_{k=1}^{K}\mathbb{E}\!\left[\,a_k^2(t)\,\delta(\tau-\tau_k(t))\right] \,.$$}@} Because the delta function {@{selects only those paths whose instantaneous delay equals $\tau$}@}, this expression reduces to {@{a sum over all rays that arrive at that particular delay}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

### delay spread

For {@{a power‑delay profile $P(\tau)$}@}, {@{the root‑mean‑square (RMS) delay spread}@} is {@{$$\sigma_{\!d} \;=\;\sqrt{\frac{\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\infty}\!\tau^{2} P(\tau)\,d\tau}{\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\infty}\!P(\tau)\,d\tau} } \,,$$}@} or equivalently, {@{$$\sigma_d = \sqrt{\overline{\tau^2} - (\overline \tau)^2 } \,.$$}@} {@{The integrals and the averages}@} are {@{_power‑weighted_ averages}@}: {@{the numerator weights each delay by its squared value}@}, while {@{the denominator normalizes by total received power}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

If {@{$T_{\max}$ and $T_{\min}$}@} denote {@{the largest and smallest significant delays in the channel}@}, then {@{$$\tau_{\text{max} } \;=\; T_{\max} - T_{\min} \,.$$}@} <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

{@{Both RMS and maximum delay spreads}@} are used to characterize {@{how much a signal is spread out in time}@}, which {@{directly affects coherence bandwidth}@} (see below) and {@{inter‑symbol interference}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

### coherence bandwidth

{@{The _coherence bandwidth_ $B_c$}@} describes {@{the frequency range over which a channel can be considered "flat"}@} – {@{all tones within this band}@} experience {@{essentially the same amplitude fading and linear phase shift}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->  

It is defined statistically as the {@{maximum frequency separation $\Delta f$}@} for which the {@{magnitude of the correlation coefficient between two frequency responses remains above a chosen threshold}@}: {@{$$p(\Delta f)\;=\; \frac{\mathbb{E}\!\left[H(f)\,H^{*}(f+\Delta f)\right]} {\sqrt{\mathbb{E}[|H(f)|^2]\,\mathbb{E}[|H(f+\Delta f)|^2]} } \;\geq\; \text{threshold}.$$}@} {@{Typical thresholds}@} are {@{0.9 (90% correlation) or 0.5 (50% correlation)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

The {@{coherence bandwidth}@} is often approximated by {@{$$B_c \approx \frac 1 {\alpha \sigma_d} \,,$$}@} where {@{$\alpha$}@} depends on {@{the threshold}@}. For a threshold of {@{0.9, $\alpha = 50$}@}; and for a threshold of {@{0.5, $\alpha = 5$}@}. {@{A common alternative (for simplicity)}@} is simply using {@{$\alpha = 1$}@}. (annotation: __this course__: Use {@{the formula with $\alpha = 1$ for simplicity unless otherwise specified.}@}) <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

### frequency-flat fading

In {@{a narrow‑band link}@} the channel's {@{delay spread $\sigma_d$ is so small compared with the symbol period $T_s$}@} that {@{all multipath components arrive almost simultaneously}@}. Equivalently, the {@{coherence bandwidth $B_c$}@} is {@{much larger than the transmission bandwidth $B$}@}. In the {@{frequency domain}@}, {@{the transmission band}@} is {@{narrow enough such that $H(t, f)$ is almost flat inside the band}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

This {@{temporal concentration}@} permits the {@{impulse response of the multipath channel}@} to be {@{collapsed into a single complex tap}@}, i.e. {@{$$h(t)\;\approx\;a(t)\,\delta(t),$$}@} where {@{$a(t)$}@} represents the {@{complex time-varying net amplitude‑phase effect of all paths with phase-shift considered}@}: {@{$$a(t) = H(t, f_c) = \sum_{k = 1}^K a_k(t) \exp(-j 2\pi f_c \tau_k(t)) \,,$$}@} where {@{$f_c$}@} is the {@{center frequency of the transmission band}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

### frequency-selective fading

By contrast, in {@{a wide‑band system}@} {@{$\sigma_d$ is comparable to or larger than $T_s$}@}. Equivalently, {@{the coherence bandwidth $B_c$}@} is {@{much smaller than the transmission bandwidth $B$}@}. {@{The full impulse response $h(t, \tau)$}@} of the multipath channel or {@{its Fourier transform $H(t, f)$}@} must be {@{_retained_ or approximated by _multiple taps_}@}. In the {@{frequency domain}@}, {@{the transmission band is too wide to well approximate $H(t, f)$}@} as {@{a single constant function inside the band}@}. This is known as {@{_frequency selective fading_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

{@{The multipaths}@} may be {@{resolved}@}. The {@{_number of resolvable path_}@} is {@{$$L = \frac {\sigma_d} {T_s} = \frac {B_{tx} } {B_c} \,.$$}@} Intuitively this is simply {@{how many symbols the RMS delay spread spreads a transmitted symbol over}@}. Alternatively way to view it is that {@{the spread causes _intersymbol interference_ (ISI)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

For each {@{resolved path $l \in \set{1, \ldots, L}$}@}, the {@{impulse response of the multipath}@} can be {@{collapsed into a single complex tap}@}, with the {@{time-varying net amplitude‑phase effect $a(t)$}@} of {@{delays included in the resolved path with phase-shift considered}@}: {@{$$a_l(t) = \sum_{k = 1}^K a_k(t) \exp(-j 2\pi f_c \tau_k(t)) \,,$$}@} where {@{only delays in the current resolved path are included}@} and {@{$f_c$}@} is the {@{center frequency of the transmission band}@}. Overall, {@{the channel can be modeled}@} as {@{$$h(t)=\sum_{l = 1}^L a_l(t) \,x(t-T_l(t))+n(r)$$}@} where each path has {@{gain $a_l(t)$ and delay $T_l(t)$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

## Doppler spread

{@{The signal that a mobile receiver observes}@} is {@{the sum of many delayed, reflected and scattered copies of the transmitted wave}@}. Because either {@{the transmitter, receiver or surrounding objects are in motion}@}, {@{the relative delays and phases of these components change with time}@}. Consequently the {@{received envelope fluctuates}@} – this is {@{_time‑varying fading_ or _Doppler spread_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

{@{Time-varying fading or Doppler spread}@} may be caused by {@{motion of the mobile terminal or scatterers in the propagation environment}@}, or {@{any other movement that changes the path lengths}@} (e.g., {@{moving vehicles, pedestrians}@}). <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

When {@{modelling the multipath channel}@} we treat each {@{complex amplitude $a(t)$}@} as a {@{_Gaussian random process_}@}. Its {@{statistical properties}@} are captured by {@{$$R_a(\tau)=E\!\bigl[a(t)a^*(t-\tau)\bigr] \,.$$}@} and its {@{power spectral density (PSD)}@} {@{$$S_a(f)=\mathcal{F}\{\,R_a(\tau)\,\}.$$}@} These functions describe {@{how the channel's gain varies over frequency and time}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

### Doppler shift

{@{The apparent frequency shift that a moving receiver sees}@} is caused by {@{the change in distance between transmitter and receiver during each wave cycle}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

Consider {@{a carrier with wavelength $\lambda=\frac{c}{f_c}$}@}, where {@{$c$}@} is {@{speed of light}@} and {@{$f_c$}@} is {@{carrier frequency}@}. At {@{time $t=0$}@} the receiver sees {@{a zero‑crossing}@}. If the receiver is {@{stationary}@}, then {@{obviously it observers a frequency of $f_c$}@}. If it is {@{_moving away_ at a speed of $v$}@}, then it observes a {@{lower frequency $f'$}@}, as {@{each new zero-crossing needs more time to catch up to the receiver}@}. Thus, we have {@{the observed period $$T' = \frac \lambda c + \frac {vT'} c \implies \left(1 - \frac v c \right) T' = \frac \lambda c = \frac 1 {f_c} \,,$$}@} and thus {@{observed frequency: $$\boxed{f' = \left(1 - \frac v c\right) f_c} \,.$$}@} Therefore, {@{the _Doppler shift_ $f_D$ (not to be confused with _Doppler spread_)}@} in frequency is {@{$$\boxed{f_D = \frac v c f_c} \,,$$}@} and the {@{_Doppler spread_ $f_m$ (not to be confused with _Doppler shift_)}@} is {@{twice the Doppler shift}@}: {@{$$\boxed{f_m := 2 f_D = \frac {2v} c f_c} \,.$$}@} <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

Note {@{the equalities in the above formulas for Doppler shift and Doppler spread}@} hold when {@{only the receiver is moving}@}, and it is moving at {@{a speed much less than $c$ (non-relativistic speed)}@}. Still, the above formulas are {@{very good approximations when $v$ is much less than the speed of light $c$}@}, no matter if {@{the transmitter, the receiver, or both are moving}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

{@{The largest Doppler shift occurs}@} when {@{the motion is directly toward or away from the transmitter}@} (angle {@{$\theta=0^\circ$ or $180^\circ$}@}). The {@{_maximum Doppler shift_}@} is therefore {@{$$f_{D,\max} \approx \frac{v}{c}\,f_c .$$}@} For {@{arbitrary angles $\theta$}@}, {@{$$f_D(\theta) = f_{D,\max} \cos\theta \approx f_c\,\frac{v}{c}\cos\theta,$$}@} so the {@{Doppler spectrum extends from $-f_{D,\max}$ to $+f_{D,\max}$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

### coherence time

Similar to {@{coherence bandwidth}@}, {@{_coherence time_}@} may {@{statistically be defined as the maximum time separation $\Delta t$}@} for which the {@{magnitude of the autocorrelation function corresponding to the Doppler power spectral density}@} (its {@{Fourier transform}@}) remains {@{above a chosen threshold}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-24,3,250!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

### Doppler power spectral density

{@{The _Doppler power spectral density_}@} of a fading channel describes {@{how much spectral broadening it causes}@}.

## Rayleigh fading

### Rayleigh fading model

In this type of fading, because there is {@{no single strong ray to anchor the signal}@}, the {@{complex envelope}@} is {@{essentially the sum of many weak sinusoids}@}; by the {@{central‑limit theorem}@} the {@{complex baseband received signal $r(t)$}@} can be {@{modeled as a _zero-mean_ Gaussian random process}@} for both its {@{real and imaginary parts}@}.

Consequently, the {@{magnitude of the signal, $|r(t)|$}@}, follows a {@{Rayleigh distribution $$f_{|R|}(x)=\frac{x}{\sigma^{2} }\;e^{-\,x^{2}/(2\sigma^{2})}, \qquad x\ge 0,$$}@} where {@{$2 \sigma^{2}$}@} is the {@{average power of the received signal}@}.

### Rayleigh fading Doppler power spectral density

To derive the {@{Doppler PSD of Raleigh fading}@}, consider the {@{received power at a particular angle $\theta$}@}, which is proportional to {@{the incident power density $P(\theta)$ and the antenna gain $G(\theta)$}@}. Assuming {@{equal power in all directions: $P(\theta) = \frac {P_T} {2\pi}$}@}, justified by {@{Rayleigh fading}@}, we have the following formula for {@{power received between the angles $[\theta, \theta + \mathrm d\theta]$}@}: {@{$$\frac {P_T} {2\pi} G(\theta) \,\mathrm d\theta \qquad \theta \in [0, 2\pi) \,.$$}@} <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

We wish to {@{rewrite it in terms of the received Doppler shift $f_D$ instead of $\theta$}@}. First, {@{$f_D(\theta) = f_{D,\max} \cos\theta$}@} is only {@{strictly monotonic over $(0, \pi)$}@}. But using that {@{$f_D(\theta) = f_D(-\theta)$}@}, this means {@{receiving power at an angle $\theta$ and $-\theta$}@} both correspond to {@{receiving at the same amount of Doppler shift $f_D$}@}. Second, {@{$\lvert \mathrm df_D \rvert = \lvert \mathrm -f_{D,\max} \sin \theta \,\mathrm d\theta \rvert = \sqrt{f_{D,\max}^2 - f_D^2} \,\lvert \mathrm d\theta \rvert$}@}, where {@{the absolute sign is taken}@} because it would be {@{too troublesome to consider the integration directions}@}, and the integration directions are {@{known to be correct already from physical intuition}@}. Thus, we have the following formula for {@{power received between the Doppler shifts $[f_D, f_D + \mathrm df_D]$}@}: {@{$$\frac {P_T} {2\pi} G(\theta) \,\mathrm d\theta \qquad \theta \in [0, 2\pi) \implies \frac {P_T} {2\pi} \frac {G(\theta) + G(-\theta)} {\sqrt{f_{D,\max}^2 - f_D^2} } \,\mathrm df_D \qquad f_D \in [0, f_{D,\max}) \,.$$}@} If we further assume {@{an omnidirectional antenna (equal gain in all directions)}@}, it gives the {@{_Doppler power spectral density_}@}: {@{$$\boxed{S(f) = \frac {P_T G} {\pi \sqrt{f_{D,\max}^2 - (f - f_c)^2} } \qquad f \in (f_c - f_{D,\max}, f_c + f_{D, \max}) } \,,$$}@} where {@{the replacement $f_D = \lvert f - f_c \rvert$}@} is applied. This requires {@{$\lvert f_D \rvert < f_{D,\max}$}@} for {@{the denominator to be nonzero or square root to be defined}@}; and otherwise, {@{$S(f) = 0$}@}. {@{The 'bowl shape' or 'bathtub shape'}@} is {@{the classic form of this Doppler spectrum}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

### Rayleigh fading error analysis

When {@{a binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) signal}@} traverses {@{a narrowband channel that can be modeled by a single complex coefficient}@}, the received waveform is {@{$$y(t)=a\,x(t)+n_i(t) \,,$$}@} where {@{$x(t)$}@} is {@{the transmitted BPSK pulse}@}, {@{$a$}@} is {@{the Rayleigh-distributed fading amplitude (complex phase uniformly random)}@}, and {@{$n_i(t)$}@} is {@{the additive white Gaussian noise}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

{@{The instantaneous signal–noise ratio}@} is {@{$$\gamma=\frac{|a|^{2}E_b}{N_0},$$}@} where {@{$E_b$}@} is {@{the energy per bit}@} and {@{$N_0$}@} {@{the _one-sided_ noise spectral density}@}. With {@{coherent demodulation}@}, {@{the probability of a bit error _given_ $\gamma$}@} is {@{$$P_e(\gamma)=Q\!\bigl(\sqrt{2\,\gamma}\bigr),$$}@} where {@{$Q(\cdot)$}@} is {@{the Gaussian Q-function}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

Given {@{the average BER $$\boxed{\overline{P}_e=\frac12\!\left(1-\sqrt{\frac{\bar\gamma}{1+\bar\gamma} }\right)}$$}@}, for {@{high SNR per bit $\bar\gamma \gg 1$}@}, it is well approximated by {@{$$\boxed{\overline{P}_e \;\approx\; \frac{1}{4\,\bar\gamma} }$$}@}, illustrating {@{a _first-order_ (inversely proportional) decay}@} rather than {@{the exponential decay seen in AWGN channels}@}. {@{The approximation is derived}@} as follows: {@{$$1 - \sqrt{\frac {\overline \gamma} {1 + \overline \gamma} } = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac 1 {\overline \gamma} } \approx \frac 1 {2 \overline \gamma} \,.$$}@} Note that in {@{BPSK, SNR equals SNR per bit}@} as its {@{spectral efficiency $\eta = 1~\text{bits/s/Hz}$}@}, so {@{$\overline \gamma$ in the above formulas}@} could all be {@{replaced by average $\text{SNR}_{\text{lin} }$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

At {@{high SNR}@}, the decay is {@{inversely proportional instead of exponential}@}, so {@{the flat fading channel's BER curve flattens}@}: achieving {@{$10^{-3}$ BER}@} may require {@{an additional about 15&nbsp;dB over the AWGN benchmark}@}. {@{This _SNR penalty_}@} reflects {@{the random deep fades that occasionally dominate the instantaneous SNR}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

## fading types

{@{The performance of a wireless link}@} depends on {@{how the channel varies over time and frequency}@}. {@{Two fundamental quantities}@} describe {@{the _temporal_ and _spectral_ extent}@} of {@{this variation of a _signal_}@}: <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

- _Signal coherence time_ $T_s$ ::@:: – the interval during which the transmitted waveform can be considered unchanged by the channel. Usually, this is the same as the symbol time. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Transmission bandwidth_ $\mathcal{W}_{tx}$ ::@:: – the spectral width occupied by the signal. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

{@{The _channel_ itself}@} has {@{analogous limits}@}, determined by {@{multipath dispersion}@}: <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

- _Channel coherence time_ $T_c$ ::@:: – how long the statistical properties of fading remain essentially constant. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Coherence bandwidth_ $B_c$ ::@:: – the frequency span over which the channel's response is flat (i.e., two tones separated by less than $B_c$ experience almost identical attenuation). <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

By comparing {@{the signal-level parameters to the channel limits}@} we classify {@{fading into four canonical types}@}: <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

- _Slow fading_: ::@:: $T_s \ll T_c$ – the channel changes much more slowly than the symbol duration. Often, this is a thousand or more symbol periods. (annotation: __this course__: For simplicity, treat $T_s < T_c$ as slow fading unless otherwise specified.) <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Fast fading_: ::@:: $T_s \gg T_c$ – significant channel variation occurs within ten to a few hundred symbol period. (annotation: __this course__: For simplicity, treat $T_s > T_c$ as fast fading unless otherwise specified.) <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
  - _Very fast fading_: ::@:: $T_s < T_c$: the channel's coherence time is shorter than the symbol period, so the channel varies faster than the baseband signal (a very rare phenomenon in practical systems).  (annotation: __this course__: For simplicity, ignore this unless otherwise specified.) <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Frequency‑flat fading_: ::@:: $\mathcal{W}_{tx} \ll B_c$ – the channel response is essentially constant across the signal bandwidth. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Frequency‑selective fading_: ::@:: $\mathcal{W}_{tx} \gg B_c$ – the channel varies markedly over the transmitted spectrum. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

Combining {@{the temporal and spectral axes}@} yields {@{4 combinations}@}: {@{slow, flat; slow, selective; fast, flat; and fast, selective}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

- _Slow, flat_ fading ::@:: is typical for narrowband systems moving slowly relative to the scattering environment (e.g., voice channels). Simple coding and equalization suffices; channel estimation can be performed once per coherence interval. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Slow, selective_ fading ::@:: is usual for current cellular networks (e.g., 5G&nbsp;mmWave), as the coherence time is still on the order of milliseconds at vehicular speeds. Advanced equalization is needed. OFDM or multi‑carrier modulation may also be useed to convert the frequency selectivity into parallel flat subchannels. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Fast, selective_ fading ::@:: appears in high‑mobility scenarios with wideband transmissions (e.g., satellite links, UAV links). It requires more frequent channel tracking, possibly adaptive modulation, or robust diversity schemes (time, frequency, or space). <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

### line-of-sight fading

While many systems assume {@{a simple flat or Rayleigh fading model}@}, practical deployments often {@{encounter two distinct propagation regimes}@}: {@{_Non-Line-of-Sight (Non-LOS)_ and _Line-of-Sight (LOS)_}@} channels. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->  

{@{A _non-LOS_ channel occurs}@} when {@{obstacles—such as buildings, trees, or terrain}@}—block {@{the direct path between a transmitter and receiver}@}.  {@{The received signal}@} is then composed of {@{many reflected, diffracted, and scattered waves that arrive at slightly different times and angles}@}.  When {@{the complex baseband envelope of such a channel}@} is expressed in terms of {@{its real and imaginary parts}@}, each component can be modeled as an {@{independent zero-mean Gaussian random variable with equal variance}@}.  Consequently, {@{the magnitude of the signal}@} follows a {@{_Rayleigh_ distribution}@} while {@{the phase remains uniformly distributed over $[0,2\pi)$}@}.  {@{This statistical characterization}@} captures the {@{rapid amplitude fluctuations typical of urban outdoor cellular links}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

In contrast, {@{a _LOS_ channel is present}@} when {@{an unobstructed path exists between the transmitter and receiver}@}.  {@{Indoor environments or rural macro‑cell scenarios}@} often exhibit this behavior.  {@{The complex envelope in a LOS situation}@} can be represented by {@{two independent Gaussian components that now possess non‑zero means}@}; each component typically has {@{mean $A/\sqrt{2}$}@}, where {@{$A$}@} denotes {@{the deterministic line‑of‑sight amplitude}@}.  Because of {@{this coherent component}@}, the resulting envelope follows a {@{_Ricean_ distribution rather than Rayleigh}@}.  {@{The probability density function for the received amplitude $r \ge 0$}@} is {@{$$P(r)=\frac{r}{\sigma^{2} }\exp\!\left(-\frac{r^{2}+A^{2} }{2\sigma^{2} }\right) I_{0}\!\left(\frac{A r}{\sigma^{2} }\right)\,, \qquad r \ge 0 \,,$$}@} with {@{$I_{0}$}@} being {@{the modified Bessel function of the first kind}@} and {@{$\sigma^{2}$}@} denoting {@{the variance of the scattered components}@}.  {@{The phase remains uniformly distributed}@}, reflecting {@{the random nature of the multipath contributions around the dominant LOS component}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

{@{Both non-LOS and LOS fading models}@} are crucial for {@{designing robust wireless systems}@}: {@{modulation schemes, error–control coding, and diversity techniques}@} must account for  {@{the differing amplitude statistics}@} to maintain {@{link reliability across varied propagation environments}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

## fading mitigations

To mitigate {@{flattening caused by frequency-flat fading}@}, {@{_diversity combining_}@}, i.e. introducing {@{_independent_ fading branches—time, frequency, or spatial}@}—reduces {@{the variance of the power flattening $|a|^2$}@}. This is done by {@{combining all branches in a specific way (learn later)}@}, yielding {@{a steeper BER slope and markedly lower required SNR}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

{@{Frequency-selective fading}@}, apart from flattening, additionally causes {@{_inter‑symbol interference_ (ISI)}@}, which in turn flattens the {@{bit‑error‑rate (BER) curve on a log‑scale plot}@}, creating an {@{_irreducible_ error floor even at very high signal‑to‑noise ratios}@}. To mitigate ISI, {@{_equalization_ algorithms}@} are used to {@{undo the ISI introduced by the channel's impulse response}@}, thereby reducing the error floor. {@{These combined strategies}@} enable {@{reliable wideband transmission even in highly dispersive environments}@}. {@{Possible equalization algorithms}@} include {@{successive interference cancellation (SIC), zero forcing (ZF), joint detection, etc.}@} <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

- _Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC)_: ::@:: estimate previous symbols, reconstruct their contributions, subtract them from the current observation. Requires accurate channel estimation and correct earlier decisions; errors propagate and degrade performance. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Zero‑Forcing (ZF)_: ::@:: when multiple receive antennas provide a higher‑dimensional observation, project onto the null space of the ISI subspace to eliminate interference at the cost of increased noise enhancement. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
- _Joint detection_: ::@:: treat the entire block of symbols as one hypothesis and decode ABCD together based on y₁…y₄; optimal but computationally exponential in L. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

{@{Fast fading}@} requires {@{more frequent channel tracking}@}, possibly {@{adaptive modulation}@}, or {@{robust diversity schemes (time, frequency, or code)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

### fading mitigation examples

In {@{contemporary cellular networks}@}, the {@{number of resolvable multipath taps grows with system bandwidth}@}. For example, {@{GSM operates over a 200&nbsp;kHz band}@} and typically experiences {@{only two significant taps}@}, making {@{simple equalisation viable}@}; by contrast, {@{3G CDMA's 5&nbsp;MHz spectrum}@} can involve {@{around fifty taps}@}, while {@{LTE's 20&nbsp;MHz channel}@} may present {@{roughly two hundred taps}@}, with even {@{larger counts in 5G deployments}@}. Because {@{wider bands reduce the coherence bandwidth relative to the signal spectrum}@}, {@{frequency selectivity—and consequently inter‑symbol interference (ISI)}@}—becomes {@{unavoidable}@}; designers therefore {@{cannot rely on "good enough" fading assumptions}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

To {@{manage ISI without incurring exponential receiver complexity}@}, modern systems distribute {@{the equalisation burden between transmitter and receiver}@}. {@{Transmitter‑side waveform design}@} introduces {@{exploitable structure}@}: {@{3G CDMA}@} {@{employs spreading codes}@} that allow {@{linear matched filtering at the receiver}@} (the so‑called {@{rake receivers}@}); {@{LTE}@} uses {@{orthogonal frequency‑division multiplexing (OFDM)}@}, reducing {@{per‑subcarrier equalisation to a fast Fourier transform followed by simple scaling}@}; {@{emerging 5G/6G research}@} explores {@{alternative waveforms such as UFMC and FBMC}@} that similarly {@{expose structure for efficient decoding}@}. Moreover, {@{the operating environment}@} influences {@{coherence bandwidth}@}—{@{outdoor scenarios}@} generally yield {@{smaller values than indoor ones}@}, explaining why {@{Wi‑Fi's indoor design}@} benefits from a {@{larger (~1&nbsp;MHz) coherence bandwidth}@} and thus {@{lower equalisation complexity}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

## fading examples

{@{Practical measurements}@} show that the {@{root‑mean‑square (RMS) delay spread}@} – a key indicator of {@{multipath dispersion}@} – varies {@{markedly with both environment and carrier frequency}@}. In {@{dense urban settings}@}, {@{900&nbsp;MHz signals}@} typically exhibit an {@{average delay spread around 1300&nbsp;ns}@}, with a {@{standard deviation near 600&nbsp;ns}@} and {@{occasional peaks up to 3500&nbsp;ns}@}; the {@{worst‑case reported in San&nbsp;Francisco}@} reached {@{10–25&nbsp;µs at a similar frequency}@}. {@{Suburban deployments}@} display a {@{broader range}@}: while {@{typical cases fall between 200 and 310&nbsp;ns}@}, {@{extreme measurements}@} can approach {@{2&nbsp;µs (1960–2110&nbsp;ns)}@}. {@{Indoor scenarios}@} show {@{much smaller spreads}@}; {@{office buildings operating near 1.5&nbsp;GHz}@} report {@{averages of 10–50&nbsp;ns with medians near 25&nbsp;ns}@}, whereas {@{measurements at 850&nbsp;MHz}@} reached a {@{maximum of 270&nbsp;ns}@}, and at {@{1900&nbsp;MHz}@} {@{average values between 70 and 94&nbsp;ns}@} were observed. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

These figures show that {@{delay spread – and therefore multipath fading severity}@} – is {@{largely dictated by the surroundings}@}. {@{Open suburban areas}@} yield {@{small spreads (200–310&nbsp;ns)}@}, whereas {@{dense urban canyons}@} can reach {@{several microseconds}@}; {@{indoor spaces}@} fall {@{in between but still exhibit noticeable dispersion}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

{@{Other key influences}@} include {@{mobility (Doppler shifts cause rapid fades)}@}, {@{carrier frequency (higher frequencies suffer more loss and blockage, yet may have smaller spreads due to shorter wavelengths)}@}, {@{antenna characteristics (beamwidth, polarization, diversity)}@}, and {@{dynamic environmental factors such as rain or moving vehicles that change the scattering profile over time}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->

{@{Designing robust wireless systems}@} therefore relies on {@{understanding these dependencies}@}: selecting {@{appropriate modulation}@}, implementing {@{diversity and equalization techniques}@}, and tailoring {@{network deployment to local propagation conditions}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270!2025-12-25,4,270-->
