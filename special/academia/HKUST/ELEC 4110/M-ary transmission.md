# _M_-ary transmission

- see: [general/_M_-ary transmission](../../../../general/M-ary%20transmission.md)

{@{___M_-ary transmission__}@} is {@{a digital communication technique}@} in which {@{each transmitted _symbol_ conveys $\log_2 M$ _bits_ of information}@} by selecting {@{one waveform from a finite set of $M$ orthogonal or non-orthogonal signal shapes}@}. By increasing {@{the _modulation order_ $M$}@}, systems can achieve {@{higher spectral efficiency}@}, at the cost of {@{greater sensitivity to noise}@} and often requiring {@{more sophisticated detection schemes}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-23,67,329!2026-03-13,55,310!2026-03-13,57,310!2026-04-06,79,350!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-03-28,72,341!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-03-16,58,310-->

Unlike {@{[binary modulation](binary%20modulation.md)}@} where {@{a _bit_ and a _symbol_ refer to the same thing}@}, here {@{a _symbol_ can represent more than one _bit_}@}, and thus should be {@{distinguished in this context}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-21,63,329!2026-03-23,67,329!2026-03-13,55,310!2026-03-27,69,329-->

## background

{@{Digital communication systems}@} consist of {@{three core components}@}: {@{a _transmitter_ (often called a digital modulator)}@}, {@{a _receiver_ (or demodulator)}@}, and {@{the _physical channel_ that conveys the signal between them}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-05,78,341!2026-03-25,67,329!2026-03-28,70,341!2026-03-31,73,350!2026-04-05,80,350-->

{@{The performance of such systems}@} is typically {@{quantified by metrics}@} such as {@{the bit error rate (BER) and the achievable bit rate}@}. {@{BER}@} measures {@{the fraction of bits that are incorrectly decoded relative to the total transmitted}@}, while {@{the bit rate}@} indicates {@{how many bits can be conveyed per second over a given channel}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-04-08,81,341!2026-03-15,57,310!2026-04-02,75,329!2026-04-10,83,341!2026-04-04,77,341!2026-03-15,57,310-->

{@{Two fundamental resources}@} {@{limit digital communication}@}: {@{bandwidth and power}@}. {@{Bandwidth}@} refers to {@{the range of frequencies available for transmission}@}, whereas {@{power}@} determines {@{the signal-to-noise ratio achievable at the receiver end}@}. {@{The trade-off between these resources}@} underpins {@{many design decisions}@} in {@{modulation and coding}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-07,82,341!2026-04-11,84,350!2026-04-03,76,341!2026-03-29,73,329!2026-03-28,70,341!2026-04-07,80,341!2026-04-05,78,341!2026-03-31,73,350!2026-04-07,80,341!2026-03-15,57,310-->

### digital modulation

{@{A digital modulator}@} maps {@{discrete _data symbols_}@} to {@{continuous-time waveforms called _modulation symbols_}@}. {@{Each symbol}@} is typically {@{a pulse of finite duration}@}, often {@{shaped to limit spectral leakage}@}. For instance, {@{a binary modulator}@} takes {@{a single bit $\{0,1\}$}@} and {@{outputs one of two possible pulses from a set such as $\{s_0(t),\, s_1(t)\}$}@}. {@{Pulse trains generated by such modulators}@} can be {@{rectangular or smoothly shaped}@} depending on {@{the chosen pulse shaping filter}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-07,80,341!2026-04-06,79,350!2026-04-08,81,341!2026-03-31,75,329!2026-04-02,77,341!2026-04-07,82,341!2026-03-22,66,329!2026-03-23,67,329!2026-03-21,63,329!2026-04-03,76,329!2026-04-03,76,329!2026-03-16,58,310-->

{@{The rate at which _symbols_ are transmitted}@} is called {@{the _baud rate_ or _symbol rate_}@}. It is defined as {@{the reciprocal of the _symbol duration_ $T_s$}@}: {@{$$R_{\text{baud} }=\frac{1}{T_s} \,.$$}@} Because {@{each symbol may carry multiple bits}@}, {@{the bit rate in bits per second}@} can be {@{higher than the baud rate}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-26,70,341!2026-03-25,67,329!2026-03-13,55,310!2026-04-08,83,341!2026-04-03,76,329!2026-03-25,67,329!2026-03-24,66,329-->

{@{An $M$-ary modulator}@} extends this idea by allowing {@{one of $M$ distinct symbols}@} to {@{represent $\log_2 M$ bits}@}. {@{The _modulation alphabet_}@} is then {@{$\mathcal{S}=\{s_0(t),\, s_1(t),\,\dots,\, s_{M-1}(t)\}$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-06,79,341!2026-03-13,57,310!2026-03-20,62,329!2026-03-15,57,310!2026-03-29,73,350-->

### channel

{@{A common model for the _channel_}@} is {@{_additive white Gaussian noise_ (AWGN)}@}. In this model {@{the received signal $y(t)$}@} equals {@{the transmitted waveform $x(t)$ plus a zero-mean Gaussian noise process $n(t)$}@}: {@{$$y(t)=x(t)+n(t) \,.$$}@} {@{The AWGN channel}@} introduces {@{only random fluctuations}@} without {@{altering the waveform shape}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-03-23,65,329!2026-03-31,73,350!2026-03-15,57,310!2026-03-15,57,310!2026-03-30,74,341!2026-03-30,72,341!2026-03-14,58,310-->

### energy and power

Assuming {@{_equiprobable_ symbols}@}, {@{the _average energy per symbol_ $E_s$ and _transmit power_ $P_\text{tx}$}@} are respectively {@{$$E_s=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^ME_{\!s,i},\qquad P_\text{tx}=E_s/T_s \,,$$}@} where {@{$E_{s,i}$ are the _symbol energies_ and $T_s$ is the _symbol duration_}@}. Note {@{the average energy per _bit_ $E_b$}@} {@{equals the average energy per _symbol_ $E_s$}@} when {@{the modulator is a binary modulator}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-30,72,341!2026-04-05,78,341!2026-04-04,77,341!2026-03-13,57,310!2026-03-27,71,341!2026-04-03,78,341!2026-04-06,79,350-->

### bandwidth

{@{The transmission bandwidth $W$}@} for {@{a pulse-shaped digital signal}@} is {@{the occupied frequency range required}@} to carry {@{the modulated waveform without significant distortion}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-26,68,329!2026-04-07,80,350!2026-03-27,69,329!2026-03-24,66,329-->

{@{The _modulation efficiency_ \(_spectral efficiency_\)}@} of {@{a digital link}@} is {@{bounded by the Nyquist–Hartley limit}@}: {@{an alphabet with $M$ symbols}@} can carry {@{$N=\log_{2}M$ bits per symbol (bpcu)}@}, called {@{the modulation efficiency and measured in _bit/symbol_ or _bpcu_}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-20,62,329!2026-03-25,67,329!2026-04-10,83,341!2026-03-31,73,329!2026-04-04,77,341!2026-05-11,95,372-->  

For {@{a baseband system}@} whose {@{pulse shaping}@} limits {@{the bandwidth to $B$}@} Hz, {@{the maximum achievable symbol rate without intersymbol interference}@} is {@{$2B$ symbols/s}@}.  Consequently {@{the spectral efficiency}@} cannot exceed {@{$$\eta_{\max}= 2N\;\text{bits/s/Hz} \,,$$}@} where _N_ is {@{the modulation efficiency measured in _bit/symbol_ or _bpcu_}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-14,58,310!2026-03-24,68,329!2026-08-18,194,329!2026-03-27,71,341!2026-03-31,73,350!2026-03-13,57,310!2026-03-31,73,329!2026-04-27,83,372-->

In {@{a passband link}@} of {@{total bandwidth $W$ Hz}@}, {@{the signal}@} can be {@{down-converted to an equivalent baseband with cutoff frequency $W/2$}@}. If {@{a conventional double-sideband scheme (QAM, ASK, PSK, OFDM)}@} is used, this yields {@{a symbol rate limited to $W$ symbols/s}@} and therefore {@{$$\eta_{\max}=N \;\text{bits/s/Hz} \,,$$}@} where _N_ is {@{the modulation efficiency measured in _bit/symbol_ or _bpcu_}@}. If instead {@{a digital single-sideband modulation}@} is employed, {@{the pass-band bandwidth $W$}@} directly {@{maps onto a baseband of width $W$}@}, allowing {@{a symbol rate up to $2W$}@}.  In that case {@{the spectral efficiency}@} can reach {@{$$\eta_{\max}=2N \;\text{bits/s/Hz} \,.$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-04-03,76,350!2026-04-08,81,341!2026-04-02,75,329!2026-03-29,71,341!2026-03-31,75,329!2026-03-24,68,329!2026-04-07,82,341!2026-04-02,75,341!2026-03-13,57,310!2026-04-04,77,341!2026-04-05,78,341!2026-08-25,200,329!2026-04-03,78,341!2026-05-04,89,372-->

When {@{a raised-cosine or similar filter}@} with {@{a pulse-shape factor $\alpha$ is applied}@}, {@{the spectrum may further widens}@} by {@{the factor $1+\alpha$}@}; thus {@{the resulting bandwidth}@} is {@{multiplied by $1 + \alpha$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-15,57,310!2026-03-14,56,310!2026-04-03,76,341!2026-04-08,81,341!2026-03-23,67,329!2026-03-23,65,329-->

### signal space

{@{Each signal $s_i(t)$}@} can be projected onto {@{an _orthonormal_ basis $\{\phi_k(t)\}_{k=1}^N$}@}. {@{The resulting coordinate vector}@} {@{$$\mathbf{s}_i=[a_{i1},\dots,a_{iN}]^\top$$}@} lives in {@{an $N$-dimensional Euclidean space}@}. {@{The set of all such vectors}@} forms {@{the _constellation_}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-24,68,329!2026-04-10,83,341!2026-04-02,75,329!2026-03-28,70,341!2026-04-05,78,341!2026-03-23,65,329!2026-03-28,70,329-->

{@{The Gram–Schmidt process}@} converts {@{any _linearly independent_ set of waveforms}@} into {@{an _orthonormal_ basis}@}. For {@{many standard modulations (e.g., PSK, QAM)}@} {@{the basis is already known}@}: {@{$$\begin{aligned} \phi_1(t) & = +\sqrt{2/T}\cos(2\pi ft) \\ \phi_2(t) & = -\sqrt{2/T}\sin(2\pi ft) \,, \end{aligned}$$}@} where {@{$f$ is a multiple of $1 / T$}@} and {@{$\sqrt{2 / T}$ _normalizes_ the basis functions}@}. Using {@{trigonometric identities}@}, {@{any real sinusoid of the same frequency $f$}@} can be {@{written as a linear combination of these two basis functions}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-28,70,350!2026-04-12,85,350!2026-03-30,72,329!2026-04-10,83,341!2026-04-08,81,341!2026-03-23,65,329!2026-04-04,77,341!2026-03-30,72,329!2026-03-29,71,341!2026-03-23,67,329!2026-04-07,82,341-->

### constellation diagram

{@{A _constellation diagram_}@} is {@{a two-dimensional plot}@} that represents {@{the set of possible symbols (waveforms)}@} used in {@{a digital modulation scheme}@}. {@{Each point on the diagram}@} corresponds to {@{one distinct symbol}@}, with {@{its coordinates}@} determined by {@{the projection of that symbol onto an orthogonal basis}@}—typically {@{the in-phase and quadrature components}@}. By visualizing {@{Euclidean distances between points}@}, designers can assess {@{error performance}@}: {@{larger minimum separations}@} yield {@{lower symbol-error rates}@} for {@{a given signal-to-noise ratio}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-04-05,78,341!2026-03-23,65,329!2026-03-27,69,341!2026-04-09,82,341!2026-03-21,63,329!2026-03-25,69,341!2026-04-06,79,350!2026-04-05,78,341!2026-03-29,71,329!2026-03-30,72,341!2026-04-02,75,329!2026-04-02,75,329-->

{@{The real-valued I (in-phase) and Q (quadrature) components}@} of {@{a baseband signal}@} are combined into {@{a single complex number $s(t)=I(t)+jQ(t)$}@}. {@{This mapping}@} exploits {@{the isomorphism between $\mathbb{R}^2$ and the complex plane}@}, allowing {@{vector operations}@} to be expressed {@{compactly with algebraic manipulation}@}. {@{Complex representation}@} simplifies {@{analysis of modulation schemes}@} such as {@{PSK and QAM}@}, where {@{constellation points}@} naturally {@{lie in the complex plane}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-04,77,341!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-04-09,82,341!2026-04-08,81,341!2026-04-01,76,341!2026-04-07,82,341!2026-03-24,68,329!2026-04-08,83,341!2026-03-22,66,329!2026-03-31,75,329!2026-04-02,77,341!2026-04-07,80,350-->

## modulation families

When comparing {@{modulator designs}@}, designers weigh {@{_performance_ against _resource_ constraints}@}. {@{Amplitude shift keying (ASK)}@} modulates information by {@{varying the amplitude of a carrier}@}; it is {@{simple to generate \(easy to implement on hardware\)}@} but {@{highly vulnerable to fading and additive noise}@} because {@{signal energy is concentrated in a single envelope}@}. {@{Frequency shift keying (FSK), particularly its binary form}@}, transmits data by {@{switching between two distinct frequencies}@}; {@{this orthogonality}@} yields {@{larger minimum-distance separation for a given power}@}, making FSK {@{more robust}@} at the expense of {@{higher spectral occupancy}@}.  Consequently, for channels where {@{signal integrity is paramount and bandwidth is ample}@}, FSK is {@{generally preferred over ASK}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-04,77,341!2026-03-15,57,310!2026-03-15,57,310!2026-03-13,55,310!2026-04-05,78,341!2026-03-19,61,329!2026-04-01,74,341!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-04-01,74,329!2026-04-07,82,341!2026-03-31,73,329!2026-04-01,74,329!2026-03-14,58,310!2026-03-22,66,329!2026-03-26,68,341-->

For {@{higher data rates within fixed bandwidth}@}, {@{M-ary phase or quadrature amplitude modulation (PSK/QAM)}@} is preferred.  {@{These constellations}@} keep {@{the signal space two-dimensional regardless of $M$}@}, so {@{the required bandwidth}@} does not {@{grow with symbol density}@}; however, {@{increasing $M$ condenses constellation points}@} and forces {@{higher transmit power to maintain a target error probability}@}. For example, {@{a terrestrial wireless link}@} has {@{limited spectrum and requires high data throughput}@}. {@{A dense two-dimensional modulation}@} such as {@{M-ary QAM (e.g., 64-QAM, 256-QAM, 1024-QAM, 4096-QAM)}@} offers {@{the highest spectral efficiency}@}, enabling {@{a wide-bandwidth video stream}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-31,75,350!2026-03-22,64,329!2026-03-13,57,310!2026-03-25,69,329!2026-03-23,65,329!2026-04-07,80,341!2026-04-03,76,350!2026-04-02,77,341!2026-03-28,70,329!2026-03-30,72,341!2026-03-24,68,329!2026-04-09,82,341!2026-03-15,57,310!2026-04-07,80,341-->

Conversely, for {@{higher data rates within fixed transmit power}@}, {@{M-ary FSK}@} preserves {@{orthogonality}@} at the cost of {@{expanding bandwidth proportionally to $M$}@}, thereby achieving {@{excellent power efficiency but poor spectral efficiency}@}. For example, {@{a space mission}@} prioritises {@{power efficiency and link reliability over spectral bandwidth}@}; {@{the transmission channel}@} suffers {@{severe path loss and limited transmitter power}@}. FSK is thus {@{favored for satellite-to-earth links}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-04-12,85,350!2026-03-25,67,329!2026-03-15,57,310!2026-03-29,71,341!2026-04-08,83,341!2026-04-03,78,341!2026-03-22,64,329!2026-04-01,74,341!2026-03-13,55,310-->

### M-PSK

- see: [M-PSK](M-PSK.md)

{@{_M-ary phase shift keying_ (M-PSK)}@} maps {@{$\log_2M$ bits onto one of $M$ equally spaced points}@} on {@{a unit circle in the constellation diagram}@}, forming {@{a regular polygon constellation}@}. {@{The modulation}@} is {@{purely phase-based}@}; {@{amplitude remains constant}@}, which makes M-PSK {@{immune to linear amplitude distortions}@} but {@{susceptible to phase noise and nonlinearities}@}. $M$ can be {@{increased without increasing bandwidth}@}, enabling {@{high spectral efficiency}@} at the expense of {@{higher bit error rates}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-22,64,329!2026-03-28,72,329!2026-03-14,58,310!2026-03-30,72,341!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-03-29,71,329!2026-03-13,57,310!2026-03-28,72,329!2026-04-04,77,341!2026-03-31,73,341!2026-04-09,82,341!2026-04-09,82,341-->

For {@{an $M$-ary PSK system}@} {@{the transmitted waveform corresponding to symbol index $m\in\{0,\dots ,M-1\}$}@} is {@{$$s_m(t)=A\,\cos \!\bigl(2\pi f_c t+\varphi_m\bigr),\qquad 0\le t<T_s \,,$$}@} where {@{$f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T_s$ is the symbol duration}@}, and {@{$\varphi_m=\frac{2\pi m}{M}$}@}. Typically, {@{$f_c$ is a multiple of $1 / T_s$}@}. {@{The constant amplitude $A=\sqrt{\dfrac{2E}{T_s} }$}@} guarantees that {@{each symbol has the same average energy $E$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-09,82,341!2026-03-29,71,341!2026-03-15,57,310!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-03-26,70,341!2026-07-02,155,310!2026-04-11,84,350!2026-03-31,75,341-->

{@{The $M$-ary PSK constellation}@} consists of {@{$M$ equally spaced points lying on the circumference of a unit circle in the signal space}@}. {@{Each point}@} corresponds to {@{one symbol}@} and is distinguished {@{solely by its phase angle}@}; {@{all symbols}@} have {@{identical amplitude}@}, which yields {@{a regular polygon shape when plotted with orthogonal basis functions}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-11,84,350!2026-04-12,85,350!2026-03-30,72,329!2026-04-07,80,341!2026-04-03,76,350!2026-04-06,79,350!2026-04-07,82,341!2026-03-31,75,329-->

This may be derived {@{intuitively as described above}@}, or it may be derived by considering {@{the probability of the error event $\lVert \mathbf y - \mathbf s_i \rVert^2 \ge \lVert \mathbf y - \mathbf s_j \rVert^2$}@}: {@{$$\begin{aligned} \lVert \mathbf y - \mathbf s_i \rVert^2 & \ge \lVert \mathbf y - \mathbf s_j \rVert^2 \\ \lVert \mathbf s_i + \mathbf n - \mathbf s_i \rVert^2 & \ge \lVert \mathbf s_i + \mathbf n - \mathbf s_j \rVert^2 \\ \lVert \mathbf n \rVert^2 & \ge \lVert \mathbf s_i - \mathbf s_j \rVert^2 + \lVert \mathbf n \rVert^2 + 2 \langle \mathbf s_i - \mathbf s_j, \mathbf n \rangle \\ \langle \mathbf s_j - \mathbf s_i, \mathbf n \rangle & \ge \frac 1 2 \lVert \mathbf s_i - \mathbf s_j \rVert^2 \,, \end{aligned}$$}@} and as {@{$\langle \mathbf s_j - \mathbf s_i,\mathbf n \rangle$}@} is {@{a projection of the noise vector onto one dimension}@}, it follows {@{a zero-mean normal distribution with variance $\sigma^2 = N_0 / 2$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-14,56,310!2026-03-27,69,341!2026-03-21,63,329!2026-04-08,83,341!2026-10-15,222,329!2026-03-24,66,329!2026-03-14,58,310!2026-04-09,82,341!2026-04-02,75,350!2026-04-09,82,341!2026-04-02,75,329!2026-05-01,86,372!2026-05-09,95,372!2026-04-12,66,352!2026-04-28,84,372!2026-04-27,83,372!2026-05-11,95,372-->

### effects of bandwidth and power

{@{Increasing bandwidth}@} _directly_ {@{raises the attainable baud rate}@} because {@{the symbol rate}@} is {@{bounded by the available spectral width}@}.  Consequently, {@{the bit rate $R = \frac {\log_2 M} {T_s} \propto B$}@} grows {@{linearly with bandwidth $B$}@}, where {@{$M$ denotes the modulation order}@}. In {@{schemes such as M-ary FSK}@}, {@{enlarging $B$}@} can {@{_indirectly_ expand the dimensionality of the signal space}@}, effectively {@{increasing the minimum Euclidean distance between symbols}@} for {@{a fixed bSNR $E_b/N_0$}@} \(since {@{each symbol carries more bits}@}, thus {@{higher energy per symbol}@}\); {@{this geometric separation}@} reduces {@{the symbol error probability}@} at {@{the expense of occupying more spectrum}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-09,82,341!2026-03-15,57,310!2026-03-26,68,329!2026-04-07,80,350!2026-04-09,82,341!2026-04-04,77,341!2026-04-03,76,341!2026-04-06,79,350!2026-03-13,57,310!2026-04-07,82,341!2026-07-15,168,310!2026-08-28,202,329!2026-04-02,77,341!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-03-14,56,310!2026-05-10,94,372!2026-04-25,81,372-->

{@{Increasing transmit power}@} _directly_ {@{improves reliability and permits higher spectral efficiency}@} without {@{expanding bandwidth}@}.  By raising {@{the signal-to-noise ratio}@}, {@{the minimum distance $d_{\min}$ between constellation points}@} can be {@{enlarged}@}, {@{lowering the error probability}@} while {@{keeping the bit rate unchanged}@}. Alternatively, {@{a higher power budget}@} {@{_indirectly_ allows the use of denser constellations}@} (e.g., moving {@{from 8-PSK to 16-QAM}@}), which {@{doubles the bit rate for the same symbol rate}@}; {@{the additional symbols}@} are {@{distinguishable}@} because {@{the larger transmit amplitude}@} compensates for {@{the reduced inter-symbol spacing}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-08,81,341!2026-04-02,75,350!2026-03-13,57,310!2026-04-10,83,341!2026-04-06,79,350!2026-03-25,69,329!2026-04-03,76,350!2026-04-05,78,341!2026-03-25,67,329!2026-03-14,58,310!2026-03-28,70,329!2026-04-08,81,341!2026-03-26,68,341!2026-04-08,83,341!2026-03-13,57,310!2026-03-25,69,329-->

### decision regions

In {@{_any_ demodulation scheme}@} {@{each possible transmitted symbol $s_i$}@} is associated with {@{a distinct decision region $\mathcal{R}_i$ in the signal space $\mathbf{y}$}@}.

When {@{a received signal falls into a cell}@}, the rule will {@{choose the constellation point inside the cell}@}. {@{The boundary between two symbols}@} is {@{the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining them}@}; {@{all points on one side}@} are {@{closer to one symbol than the other}@}. When there are {@{multiple symbols}@}, {@{these perpendicular bisectors}@} intersect to form {@{vertices adjacent to three or more cells}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-01,74,341!2026-03-24,66,329!2026-03-19,61,329!2026-03-28,70,341!2026-04-01,76,350!2026-03-24,68,329!2026-04-04,79,350!2026-03-24,68,329!2026-04-05,78,341!2026-03-26,68,341!2026-03-26,70,341!2026-03-28,70,341!2026-03-14,58,310!2026-04-04,77,341-->

### maximum likelihood

For {@{a digital transmitter}@} that can send {@{one of $M$ symbols $\{s_1,\dots ,s_M\}$}@}, let {@{$p(s_i)$}@} denote {@{the a priori probability of symbol $s_i$}@}.  If {@{$s_j$ is transmitted}@}, {@{the conditional error probability given an observation $\mathbf y$}@} equals {@{$$P_e(s_j)=1-\int_{\mathcal R_j} p(\mathbf y|s_j) \,\mathrm d\mathbf y \,,$$}@} where {@{$\{\mathcal R_1,\dots ,\mathcal R_M\}$}@} is {@{the partition of observation space into decision regions}@}. {@{Averaging over all possible transmitted symbols}@} yields {@{$$P_e=\sum_{i=1}^{M}p(s_i)\left[\,1-\!\!\int_{\mathcal R_i} p(\mathbf y|s_i) \,\mathrm d\mathbf y \right] = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^M \int_{\mathcal R_i} p(\mathbf y | s_i) p(s_i) \,\mathrm d\mathbf y \,.$$}@} Because {@{each observation $\mathbf y$}@} belongs to {@{exactly one region}@}, for {@{every $\mathbf y$}@} we choose {@{the symbol $s_k$ that maximizes the posterior}@}: {@{$$p(s_k|\mathbf y)=\frac{p(\mathbf y|s_k)\,p(s_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^{M}p(\mathbf y|s_j)p(s_j)} \,.$$}@} Since {@{the denominator}@} is {@{common to all candidates}@}, this is equivalent to {@{maximizing $p(\mathbf y|s_k)p(s_k)$}@}, so {@{the error probability $P_e$ given by the above formula}@} is {@{minimized}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-13,57,310!2026-03-29,73,329!2026-04-04,77,341!2026-04-07,82,341!2026-04-06,79,341!2026-03-26,68,341!2026-03-30,72,329!2026-04-02,77,341!2026-03-30,74,329!2026-04-03,76,329!2026-04-01,76,350!2026-04-10,83,341!2026-03-27,69,329!2026-04-01,74,341!2026-04-10,83,341!2026-03-22,66,329!2026-03-22,64,329!2026-03-20,62,329!2026-03-19,61,329!2026-03-25,67,329!2026-04-10,83,341-->

## implementation

### complexity

When moving from {@{binary to $M$-ary modulation}@}, {@{the receiver design}@} must handle {@{an expanded symbol set}@} while still {@{distinguishing each point accurately}@}.

Because {@{all symbols share the same carrier phase}@}, {@{the receiver}@} does not need a {@{PLL or carrier recovery circuit}@}, which would otherwise add {@{cost and design complexity}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-02,77,341!2026-03-20,62,329!2026-03-20,62,329!2026-04-01,76,329!2026-03-14,56,310!2026-03-27,71,341!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-04-06,79,350!2026-03-13,55,310!2026-03-26,68,341!2026-03-27,71,341!2026-04-10,83,341!2026-03-29,71,341!2026-04-03,76,350-->

To keep {@{the output within the linear band}@}, {@{transmitters}@} employ {@{_power back-off_}@}, reducing {@{the average output level}@} so that {@{even peak samples}@} remain in {@{the amplifier's linear range}@}. {@{The amount of back-off required}@} is governed by {@{the signal's peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-27,69,341!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-03-28,72,329!2026-03-26,70,341!2026-04-01,76,350!2026-03-22,66,329!2026-03-19,61,329!2026-04-03,78,341!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-04-03,78,341!2026-03-26,68,329!2026-03-26,68,329!2026-04-01,76,341!2026-03-13,55,310!2026-03-23,67,329!2026-03-26,70,341-->

{@{The _peak-to-average power ratio_ \(PAPR\)}@} is {@{the peak amplitude squared \(giving the peak _power_\)}@} divided by {@{the RMS value squared \(giving the average _power_\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-27,69,341!2026-03-14,58,310!2026-03-23,67,329-->

{@{Phase-shift keying (PSK) constellations}@} maintain {@{a constant envelope}@}, yielding {@{a low PAPR of roughly 3&nbsp;dB \(average power is about half of peak power\)}@}. {@{Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)}@}, by contrast, varies {@{both amplitude and phase across its symbols}@}, resulting in {@{a higher PAPR around 10&nbsp;dB \(may be higher or lower depending on _M_\)}@}. Consequently, {@{QAM signals}@} demand {@{more back-off}@}—typically {@{about 7&nbsp;dB greater than PSK}@}—to avoid {@{PA clipping}@}, which can diminish {@{the usable output power}@} or increase {@{amplifier stress}@} unless mitigated by {@{design adjustments}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-14,58,310!2026-04-01,74,341!2026-07-16,169,310!2026-03-13,55,310!2026-03-15,57,310!2026-04-02,75,329!2026-04-01,76,341!2026-04-06,79,350!2026-03-21,63,329!2026-03-21,63,329!2026-03-27,71,341!2026-04-08,81,341!2026-03-24,66,329-->  

For example, {@{A typical Wi-Fi radio}@} contains {@{a single PA}@} capable of {@{up to 30&nbsp;dBm (or 0&nbsp;dBW) output}@}. For {@{low-order modes}@} (e.g. {@{BPSK, QPSK, APSK}@}) {@{the average transmit power}@} sits {@{around 26&nbsp;dBm}@}, representing {@{roughly a 4&nbsp;dB back-off from peak capability}@}. {@{Higher-order modulations}@} such as {@{16-QAM or 64-QAM}@} drop to {@{about 20&nbsp;dBm}@} because they require {@{a larger back-off}@} to {@{accommodate their higher PAPR}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-08,83,341!2026-03-31,75,329!2026-04-05,80,350!2026-03-23,67,329!2026-04-04,77,341!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-04-09,82,341!2026-03-16,58,310!2026-04-02,77,341!2026-04-08,81,341!2026-03-22,66,329!2026-03-14,58,310!2026-03-16,58,310-->

## fundamental limits

In {@{digital communication theory}@} the {@{achievable data rate of a physical channel}@} is {@{bounded by Shannon's capacity theorem}@}. For an {@{additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) link}@}, the {@{maximum reliable transmission rate}@} is {@{$$C = B \log_2(1 + \tfrac{S}{N})$$}@}, where {@{$B$}@} denotes the {@{available bandwidth}@} and {@{$S/N$}@} is the {@{signal‑to‑noise ratio at the receiver}@}. Only {@{two physical resources}@} – {@{transmit power (which determines $S/N$) and spectral width}@} – can {@{increase this limit}@}; any further improvement must come from {@{more efficient use of those resources}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-01,88,372!2026-04-27,83,372!2026-05-01,86,372!2026-05-06,92,372!2026-05-03,90,372!2026-04-24,80,372!2026-05-05,90,372!2026-04-28,84,372!2026-04-28,84,372!2026-04-28,84,372!2026-05-10,94,372!2026-04-24,80,372!2026-05-07,93,372!2026-05-09,95,372-->

A {@{convenient way to compare different modulation schemes}@} is to {@{normalize rate by bandwidth}@}, yielding the {@{_spectral efficiency_ $\eta = R/B$}@} measured in {@{bits per second per hertz}@}. The {@{required energy per transmitted bit relative to the noise spectral density, $E_b/N_0$}@}, can then be expressed as {@{a function of $\eta$}@}: {@{$$\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{2^{\,\eta}-1}{\eta}$$}@}. This {@{implicit relationship}@} defines a {@{boundary in the $(\eta,E_b/N_0)$ plane}@}: {@{points lying above the curve}@} correspond to {@{operating points that exceed Shannon's limit}@} and are therefore {@{infeasible}@}; {@{points below}@} are {@{theoretically attainable with sufficiently long block codes}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-07,91,372!2026-04-29,85,372!2026-04-27,83,372!2026-05-07,93,372!2026-04-28,84,372!2026-05-05,90,372!2026-04-29,85,372!2026-05-07,93,372!2026-05-03,88,372!2026-05-08,94,372!2026-04-27,83,372!2026-05-04,89,372!2026-05-11,95,372!2026-05-02,87,372-->

### fundamental limits vs. modulation families

{@{M‑ary phase shift keying (MPSK) and M‑quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM)}@} occupy the region of {@{higher spectral efficiencies ($\eta \ge 1$)}@}. For example, {@{BPSK ($M=2$)}@} achieves {@{$\eta = 1$}@}, {@{QPSK}@} reaches {@{$\eta = 2$}@}, while {@{16‑QAM}@} attains {@{$\eta = 4$}@}. In practice, {@{uncoded MPSK and MQAM}@} require {@{significantly more $E_b/N_0$}@} than the {@{Shannon boundary predicts}@}: {@{BPSK}@} typically needs {@{about 10&nbsp;dB to achieve a low bit‑error rate (BER)}@}, whereas the {@{capacity limit at $\eta=1$ is only around 0&nbsp;dB}@}. The {@{gap widens with increasing constellation size}@}, underscoring the need for {@{channel coding to approach the fundamental limits}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-03,90,372!2026-04-27,83,372!2026-04-29,85,372!2026-05-05,91,372!2026-05-08,92,372!2026-05-11,95,372!2026-05-10,94,372!2026-05-03,88,372!2026-05-02,87,372!2026-04-27,83,372!2026-04-28,84,372!2026-05-02,89,372!2026-05-08,94,372!2026-05-09,95,372!2026-05-02,87,372!2026-05-09,93,372-->

In contrast, {@{M‑ary frequency shift keying (MFSK)}@} behaves differently. As {@{$M$ grows}@}, its {@{spectral efficiency $\eta = \frac{\log_2 M}{M}$}@} {@{diminishes toward zero}@}, but the {@{required $E_b/N_0$ simultaneously falls}@}. In the {@{asymptotic limit of very large $M$}@}, {@{uncoded MFSK}@} can {@{approach Shannon's bound with a residual gap of approximately –1.59&nbsp;dB}@}, making it the {@{only modulation family that can attain capacity}@} without {@{explicit error‑correction coding}@}—though at the cost of {@{severely increased bandwidth usage}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-09,95,372!2026-05-08,94,372!2026-04-29,85,372!2026-04-29,85,372!2026-04-26,82,372!2026-05-05,90,372!2026-04-28,84,372!2026-04-26,82,372!2026-05-08,94,372!2026-05-02,89,372!2026-05-02,87,372-->

These observations {@{delineate two canonical design regimes}@}. In {@{_power‑limited_ systems}@}, where {@{transmit power is scarce}@}, {@{MFSK's low $E_b/N_0$}@} makes it {@{attractive despite its poor spectral efficiency}@}. Conversely, in {@{_bandwidth‑limited_ environments}@}, {@{high‑order PSK or QAM}@} maximize {@{$\eta$, accepting a higher energy cost per bit}@}. In {@{most practical scenarios}@} the {@{trade‑off is resolved}@} by {@{combining moderate‑order modulation}@} with {@{powerful forward error‑correction codes (turbo, LDPC, polar, etc.)}@}, which {@{close the gap between achievable operating points and the Shannon boundary}@} across a {@{wide range of $\eta$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-04,89,372!2026-05-07,93,372!2026-04-29,85,372!2026-05-06,92,372!2026-04-28,84,372!2026-04-29,85,372!2026-05-06,92,372!2026-04-27,83,372!2026-05-08,92,372!2026-04-28,84,372!2026-05-01,88,372!2026-05-05,90,372!2026-05-10,94,372!2026-05-11,95,372-->
