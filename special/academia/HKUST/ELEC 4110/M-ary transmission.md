# _M_-ary transmission

- see: [general/_M_-ary transmission](../../../../general/M-ary%20transmission.md)

{@{___M_-ary transmission__}@} is {@{a digital communication technique}@} in which {@{each transmitted _symbol_ conveys $\log_2 M$ _bits_ of information}@} by selecting {@{one waveform from a finite set of $M$ orthogonal or non-orthogonal signal shapes}@}. By increasing {@{the _modulation order_ $M$}@}, systems can achieve {@{higher spectral efficiency}@}, at the cost of {@{greater sensitivity to noise}@} and often requiring {@{more sophisticated detection schemes}@}.

Unlike {@{[binary modulation](binary%20modulation.md)}@} where {@{a _bit_ and a _symbol_ refer to the same thing}@}, here {@{a _symbol_ can represent more than one _bit_}@}, and thus should be {@{distinguished in this context}@}.

## background

{@{Digital communication systems}@} consist of {@{three core components}@}: {@{a _transmitter_ (often called a digital modulator)}@}, {@{a _receiver_ (or demodulator)}@}, and {@{the _physical channel_ that conveys the signal between them}@}.

{@{The performance of such systems}@} is typically {@{quantified by metrics}@} such as {@{the bit error rate (BER) and the achievable bit rate}@}. {@{BER}@} measures {@{the fraction of bits that are incorrectly decoded relative to the total transmitted}@}, while {@{the bit rate}@} indicates {@{how many bits can be conveyed per second over a given channel}@}.

{@{Two fundamental resources}@} {@{limit digital communication}@}: {@{bandwidth and power}@}. {@{Bandwidth}@} refers to {@{the range of frequencies available for transmission}@}, whereas {@{power}@} determines {@{the signal-to-noise ratio achievable at the receiver end}@}. {@{The trade-off between these resources}@} underpins {@{many design decisions}@} in {@{modulation and coding}@}.

### digital modulation

{@{A digital modulator}@} maps {@{discrete _data symbols_}@} to {@{continuous-time waveforms called _modulation symbols_}@}. {@{Each symbol}@} is typically {@{a pulse of finite duration}@}, often {@{shaped to limit spectral leakage}@}. For instance, {@{a binary modulator}@} takes {@{a single bit $\{0,1\}$}@} and {@{outputs one of two possible pulses from a set such as $\{s_0(t),\, s_1(t)\}$}@}. {@{Pulse trains generated by such modulators}@} can be {@{rectangular or smoothly shaped}@} depending on {@{the chosen pulse shaping filter}@}.

{@{The rate at which _symbols_ are transmitted}@} is called {@{the _baud rate_ or _symbol rate_}@}. It is defined as {@{the reciprocal of the _symbol duration_ $T_s$}@}: {@{$$R_{\text{baud} }=\frac{1}{T_s} \,.$$}@} Because {@{each symbol may carry multiple bits}@}, {@{the bit rate in bits per second}@} can be {@{higher than the baud rate}@}.

{@{An $M$-ary modulator}@} extends this idea by allowing {@{one of $M$ distinct symbols}@} to {@{represent $\log_2 M$ bits}@}. {@{The _modulation alphabet_}@} is then {@{$\mathcal{S}=\{s_0(t),\, s_1(t),\,\dots,\, s_{M-1}(t)\}$}@}.

### channel

{@{A common model for the _channel_}@} is {@{_additive white Gaussian noise_ (AWGN)}@}. In this model {@{the received signal $y(t)$}@} equals {@{the transmitted waveform $x(t)$ plus a zero-mean Gaussian noise process $n(t)$}@}: {@{$$y(t)=x(t)+n(t) \,.$$}@} {@{The AWGN channel}@} introduces {@{only random fluctuations}@} without {@{altering the waveform shape}@}.

### energy and power

Assuming {@{_equiprobable_ symbols}@}, {@{the _average energy per symbol_ $E_s$ and _transmit power_ $P_\text{tx}$}@} are respectively {@{$$E_s=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^ME_{\!s,i},\qquad P_\text{tx}=E_s/T_s \,,$$}@} where {@{$E_{s,i}$ are the _symbol energies_ and $T_s$ is the _symbol duration_}@}. Note {@{the average energy per _bit_ $E_b$}@} {@{equals the average energy per _symbol_ $E_s$}@} when {@{the modulator is a binary modulator}@}.

### bandwidth

{@{The transmission bandwidth $W$}@} for {@{a pulse-shaped digital signal}@} is {@{the occupied frequency range required}@} to carry {@{the modulated waveform without significant distortion}@}. For {@{a symbol duration $T_s$}@}, {@{the baseband Nyquist rate}@} is {@{$1/T_s$}@}. When {@{a raised-cosine or similar filter}@} with {@{a pulse-shape factor $\alpha$ is applied}@}, {@{the spectrum widens}@} by {@{the factor $1+\alpha$}@}; thus {@{the resulting bandpass bandwidth}@} becomes {@{$$W=\frac{1}{T_s}\,(1+\alpha) \,,$$}@} where {@{$0\le\alpha\le 1$}@}. This expression captures how both {@{symbol rate and pulse-shaping}@} control {@{the spectral occupancy of the transmitted signal}@}.

{@{_Spectral efficiency_}@} is defined as {@{$\eta=\frac{\log_2 M}{B}$ (bits/s/Hz)}@}, which rises with {@{higher-order constellations without extra bandwidth}@}, but demands {@{higher signal-to-noise ratios}@} to {@{maintain the same error performance}@}.

### signal space

{@{Each signal $s_i(t)$}@} can be projected onto {@{an _orthonormal_ basis $\{\phi_k(t)\}_{k=1}^N$}@}. {@{The resulting coordinate vector}@} {@{$$\mathbf{s}_i=[a_{i1},\dots,a_{iN}]^\top$$}@} lives in {@{an $N$-dimensional Euclidean space}@}. {@{The set of all such vectors}@} forms {@{the _constellation_}@}.

{@{The Gram–Schmidt process}@} converts {@{any _linearly independent_ set of waveforms}@} into {@{an _orthonormal_ basis}@}. For {@{many standard modulations (e.g., PSK, QAM)}@} {@{the basis is already known}@}: {@{$$\begin{aligned} \phi_1(t) & = \sqrt{2/T}\cos(2\pi ft) \\ \phi_2(t) & = \sqrt{2/T}\sin(2\pi ft) \,, \end{aligned}$$}@} where {@{$f$ is a multiple of $1 / T$}@} and {@{$\sqrt{2 / T}$ _normalizes_ the basis functions}@}. Using {@{trigonometric identities}@}, {@{any real sinusoid of the same frequency $f$}@} can be {@{written as a linear combination of these two basis functions}@}.

### constellation diagram

{@{A _constellation diagram_}@} is {@{a two-dimensional plot}@} that represents {@{the set of possible symbols (waveforms)}@} used in {@{a digital modulation scheme}@}. {@{Each point on the diagram}@} corresponds to {@{one distinct symbol}@}, with {@{its coordinates}@} determined by {@{the projection of that symbol onto an orthogonal basis}@}—typically {@{the in-phase and quadrature components}@}. By visualizing {@{Euclidean distances between points}@}, designers can assess {@{error performance}@}: {@{larger minimum separations}@} yield {@{lower symbol-error rates}@} for {@{a given signal-to-noise ratio}@}.

{@{The real-valued}@} {@{I (in-phase) and Q (quadrature) components}@} of {@{a baseband signal}@} are combined into {@{a single complex number $s(t)=I(t)+jQ(t)$}@}. {@{This mapping}@} exploits {@{the isomorphism between $\mathbb{R}^2$ and the complex plane}@}, allowing {@{vector operations}@} to be expressed {@{compactly with algebraic manipulation}@}. {@{Complex representation}@} simplifies {@{analysis of modulation schemes}@} such as {@{PSK and QAM}@}, where {@{constellation points}@} naturally {@{lie in the complex plane}@}.

## modulation families

When comparing {@{modulator designs}@}, designers weigh {@{_performance_ against _resource_ constraints}@}. {@{Amplitude shift keying (ASK)}@} modulates information by {@{varying the amplitude of a carrier}@}; it is {@{simple to generate \(easy to implement on hardware\)}@} but {@{highly vulnerable to fading and additive noise}@} because {@{signal energy is concentrated in a single envelope}@}. {@{Frequency shift keying (FSK), particularly its binary form}@}, transmits data by {@{switching between two distinct frequencies}@}; {@{this orthogonality}@} yields {@{larger minimum-distance separation for a given power}@}, making FSK {@{more robust}@} at the expense of {@{higher spectral occupancy}@}.  Consequently, for channels where {@{signal integrity is paramount and bandwidth is ample}@}, FSK is {@{generally preferred over ASK}@}.

For {@{higher data rates within fixed bandwidth}@}, {@{M-ary phase or quadrature amplitude modulation (PSK/QAM)}@} is preferred.  {@{These constellations}@} keep {@{the signal space two-dimensional regardless of $M$}@}, so {@{the required bandwidth}@} does not {@{grow with symbol density}@}; however, {@{increasing $M$ condenses constellation points}@} and forces {@{higher transmit power to maintain a target error probability}@}. For example, {@{a terrestrial wireless link}@} has {@{limited spectrum and requires high data throughput}@}. {@{A dense two-dimensional modulation}@} such as {@{M-ary QAM (e.g., 64-QAM, 256-QAM, 1024-QAM, 4096-QAM)}@} offers {@{the highest spectral efficiency}@}, enabling {@{a wide-bandwidth video stream}@}.

Conversely, for {@{higher data rates within fixed transmit power}@}, {@{M-ary FSK}@} preserves {@{orthogonality}@} at the cost of {@{expanding bandwidth proportionally to $M$}@}, thereby achieving {@{excellent power efficiency but poor spectral efficiency}@}. For example, {@{a space mission}@} prioritises {@{power efficiency and link reliability over spectral bandwidth}@}; {@{the transmission channel}@} suffers {@{severe path loss and limited transmitter power}@}. FSK is thus {@{favored for satellite-to-earth links}@}.

### M-PSK

- see: [M-PSK](M-PSK.md)

{@{_M-ary phase shift keying_ (M-PSK)}@} maps {@{$\log_2M$ bits onto one of $M$ equally spaced points}@} on {@{a unit circle in the constellation diagram}@}, forming {@{a regular polygon constellation}@}. {@{The modulation}@} is {@{purely phase-based}@}; {@{amplitude remains constant}@}, which makes M-PSK {@{immune to linear amplitude distortions}@} but {@{susceptible to phase noise and nonlinearities}@}. $M$ can be {@{increased without increasing bandwidth}@}, enabling {@{high spectral efficiency}@} at the expense of {@{higher bit error rates}@}.

For {@{an $M$-ary PSK system}@} {@{the transmitted waveform corresponding to symbol index $m\in\{0,\dots ,M-1\}$}@} is {@{$$s_m(t)=A\,\cos \!\bigl(2\pi f_c t+\varphi_m\bigr),\qquad 0\le t<T_s \,,$$}@} where {@{$f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T_s$ is the symbol duration}@}, and {@{$\varphi_m=\frac{2\pi m}{M}\;.$}@} {@{The constant amplitude $A=\sqrt{\dfrac{2E}{T_s} }$}@} guarantees that {@{each symbol has the same average energy $E$}@}.

{@{The $M$-ary PSK constellation}@} consists of {@{$M$ equally spaced points lying on the circumference of a unit circle in the signal space}@}. {@{Each point}@} corresponds to {@{one symbol}@} and is distinguished {@{solely by its phase angle}@}; {@{all symbols}@} have {@{identical amplitude}@}, which yields {@{a regular polygon shape when plotted with orthogonal basis functions}@}.

{@{_Binary PSK_ \(BPSK\), _quadrature PSK_ \(QPSK\), and _8-PSK_}@} are {@{the most common special cases}@}: {@{BPSK}@} uses {@{two antipodal points ($M=2$)}@} and conveys {@{one bit per symbol}@}; {@{QPSK}@} employs {@{four points arranged in a square grid ($M=4$)}@}, delivering {@{two bits per symbol}@}; {@{8-PSK}@} uses {@{eight equally spaced points on the unit circle}@} and conveys {@{three bits per symbol}@}. All preserve {@{the fixed-tone bandwidth characteristic}@} of PSK systems; {@{only two orthogonal carrier tones \(in-phase and quadrature components\)}@} is {@{used regardless of the modulation order $M$}@}.

Under {@{equal symbol energies and two-dimensional signal space}@}, {@{QSK is optimal for quartic modulation}@} as {@{any alternative quartic scheme}@} must {@{also use four symbols}@}; {@{the only way to improve performance}@} would be to {@{increase minimum Euclidean distance}@}, which is {@{already maximal for QPSK}@}.

### M-QAM

- see: [M-QAM](M-QAM.md)

{@{_Quadrature amplitude modulation_ (M-QAM)}@} extends {@{PSK \(which only varies phase\)}@} by {@{varying both phase and amplitude}@}, arranging {@{$\sqrt{M}\times\sqrt{M}$ points}@} on {@{a rectangular grid in the complex plane}@}. {@{Each symbol}@} carries {@{$\log_2M$ bits}@}. $M$ can be {@{increased without increasing bandwidth}@}, enabling {@{equal spectral efficiency to PSK for comparable error performance}@} while operating at {@{higher signal-to-noise ratios \(higher transmit power\)}@}. M-QAM requires {@{two orthogonal carrier tones (in-phase and quadrature components)}@} regardless of {@{the modulation order $M$}@}.

For {@{symbol index $m = 0, \ldots, M - 1$}@} {@{the waveform}@} is {@{$$s_m(t)=I_m\,\sqrt{\frac{2E}{T_s} }\;\cos(2\pi f_c t)+Q_m\,\sqrt{\frac{2E}{T_s} }\;\sin(2\pi f_c t), \qquad 0\le t<T_s\,,$$}@} where {@{$I_m$ and $Q_m$ are the in-phase and quadrature amplitudes}@} chosen from {@{a rectangular grid}@} (e.g., {@{$\{-3,-1,1,3\}$ for 16-QAM}@}). {@{The scaling factor $\sqrt{2E/T_s}$}@} ensures that {@{each symbol has unit average energy $E$}@} before {@{any overall power scaling is applied}@}.

{@{An $M$-ary QAM constellation}@} forms {@{a rectangular grid of points in the two-dimensional signal space}@}. {@{The horizontal axis}@} represents {@{the in-phase component}@} and {@{the vertical axis}@} {@{the quadrature component}@}, resulting in {@{$\sqrt{M}\times\sqrt{M}$ equally spaced points}@}. This arrangement {@{maximizes Euclidean distance between adjacent symbols}@} while {@{keeping the average power bounded}@}.

In practice, {@{16-QAM}@} is {@{more popular than 16-PSK}@}. Both uses {@{sixteen symbols}@}, but QAM distributes {@{points on a rectangular grid}@}, allowing {@{the constellation}@} to be {@{expanded along both amplitude axes}@}. {@{This layout}@} achieves {@{higher spectral efficiency for a given minimum distance requirement}@} because it can maintain {@{larger symbol separations at lower energy per bit}@} than PSK, whose points are {@{confined to a circle}@} and must be {@{packed more tightly in phase}@}. As a result, 16-QAM delivers {@{superior error performance at moderate SNRs}@} and is therefore {@{the preferred choice for many high-rate communication systems}@}.

### M-FSK

- see: [M-FSK](M-FSK.md)

{@{_Frequency shift keying_ (M-FSK)}@} assigns {@{$\log_2M$ bits to one of $M$ distinct orthogonal carrier frequencies}@}. {@{Each symbol}@} is represented by {@{a single tone at a different frequency}@}, which makes FSK {@{inherently robust against amplitude fading and nonlinearities}@}—an advantage in {@{power-limited or highly distorted channels}@}. However, {@{the required bandwidth}@} expands {@{linearly with $M$}@}, as {@{each additional frequency}@} must be {@{accommodated within the channel spectrum}@}.

{@{The transmitted waveform corresponding to symbol index $m = 0, \ldots, M - 1$}@} is {@{a single tone at one of $M$ distinct frequencies}@}: {@{$$s_m(t)=A\,\cos \!\bigl(2\pi(f_c+\Delta f_m)t\bigr), \qquad 0\le t<T_s \,,$$}@} where {@{$\Delta f_m$ denotes the frequency offset for symbol $m$}@}. {@{The offsets are chosen}@} such that {@{the tones are orthogonal over the interval $T_s$}@} (e.g., {@{$\Delta f_m=m\,\Delta f_{\min}$ where $\Delta f_{\min} = 1 / T_s$}@}). Again, {@{setting $A=\sqrt{2E/T_s}$}@} gives {@{each tone an average energy $E$}@}.

{@{The constellation for $M$-ary FSK}@} is {@{a set of $M$ distinct tones}@}, each represented by {@{a point at a different frequency}@} (or equivalently, {@{the unit vectors in the $M$-dimensional constellation}@}).

## optimal receiver

{@{The receiver}@} must decide {@{which symbol was transmitted}@} based on {@{the noisy observation $\mathbf{y}$}@}. {@{_Optimality_}@} is defined as {@{minimizing the _bit error rate_ (BER)}@}.

### noise vector

{@{The channel}@} adds {@{noise $n(t)$ with power spectral density $N_0/2$}@}. In {@{vector form}@}, {@{$\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{s}_i+\mathbf{n}$}@}, where {@{$\mathbf{n}$ is a zero-mean Gaussian random vector}@} with {@{covariance matrix $(N_0/2)\mathbf{I}$}@}. On {@{the signal space diagram}@} {@{each transmitted point $\mathbf{s}_i$}@} is {@{surrounded by a spherically symmetric "cloud" of points}@} that follows {@{a Gaussian distribution with variance $N_0/2$}@}.

While {@{the desired signals}@} are {@{fully captured by the $N$ basis vectors}@}, {@{the white-noise component $n(t)$}@} may has {@{a non-zero contribution on directions}@} that {@{are orthogonal to the signal subspace}@}. Consequently, {@{the received waveform $y(t)=s_i(t)+n(t)$}@} does not, {@{in general, lie entirely within the $N$-dimensional space}@}. Since {@{those out-of-subspace noise components}@} do not affect {@{the expectation of any function of the input}@} (they carry {@{no information about the transmitted symbols}@}), {@{an optimal detector}@} can {@{safely ignore them}@}. In practice this means {@{projecting $\mathbf{y}$, including the noise, onto the $N$-point signal subspace}@}, yielding {@{a vector $\mathbf{d}=(\langle y,\phi_1\rangle,\dots,\langle y,\phi_N\rangle)^T$}@} that contains {@{all the useful observation for symbol decision}@}.

For {@{additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)}@}, {@{the power spectral density}@} is {@{constant}@}: {@{$S_n(f)=N_0/2$}@}. When {@{the received waveform with _noise_}@} is {@{projected onto an _orthonormal_ basis $\{\phi_k(t)\}$}@}, {@{each coefficient \(which represents _amplitude_ of the noise in a particular basis\)}@} becomes {@{a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with variance}@} {@{$$\sigma^2=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} S_n(f)|\Phi_k(f)|^2\,df = N_0/2 \,$$}@} where {@{$\Phi_k(f)$}@} is {@{the Fourier transform of $\phi_k(t)$}@}. \(annotation: Recall that {@{the response of a LTI system of transfer function $H(f)$}@} to {@{a WSS random signal of power spectral density $S_n(f)$}@} has {@{the Fourier transform $S_n(f) \lvert H(f) \rvert^2$}@}. And notice that {@{projection onto an orthonormal basis vector $\phi_k(t)$}@} is {@{$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \cdot\,(\tau) \phi_k^*(\tau) \,\mathrm d\tau$}@}, which can be considered as {@{convolution with $\phi_k^*(-\tau)$ evaluated at time shift $t = 0$}@}. {@{The Fourier transform of $\phi_k^*(-t)$}@} is {@{$\Phi_k^*(f)$}@}, and {@{substituting $H(f) = \Phi_k^*(f)$}@} gives {@{the integrand above}@}. Finally, {@{the integral}@} is due to {@{the convolution being evaluated at time shift $t = 0$}@}, so we need to {@{integrate over all frequencies with $e^{j 2\pi f t} = e^{j 2 \pi f (0)} = 1$}@}, which {@{disappears from the above formula}@}.\) Because {@{the basis functions are orthogonal and $S_n(f) = N_0 / 2$ is constant}@}, {@{all cross-covariances vanish}@} and {@{the covariance matrix}@} reduces to {@{a scaled identity}@}: {@{$$\mathbf{C}=(N_0/2)\,\mathbf{I}_N \,.$$}@}

For {@{a _general_ zero-mean Gaussian noise process \(or more generally, a _WSS_ process\)}@} with {@{power spectral density $S_n(f)$ that is _not flat_ \(not white noise\)}@}, {@{the covariance between two basis coefficients}@} is {@{$$C_{ij}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} S_n(f)\,\Phi_i^*(f)\,\Phi_j(f)\,df \,.$$}@} \(annotation: {@{The conjugate}@} is {@{on the first argument instead of the second argument}@} because {@{projection onto a basis vector}@} can be considered as {@{a LTI system with the transfer function $\Phi_k^*(f)$}@}.\) This integral captures {@{how the frequency-dependent energy of the noise}@} couples {@{different basis functions}@}. Consequently, {@{the covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}$}@} is {@{no longer diagonal even if the basis is orthogonal}@}; {@{its entries}@} depend on {@{both the PSD shape and the chosen basis set}@}, reflecting {@{the "color" (correlation structure) of the noise}@}.

### minimum distance

{@{The _minimum distance_ (MD) rule}@} is {@{the simplest form of optimal detection}@} for {@{_equiprobable_ symbols in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel}@}. More generally, it may be applied to noise with {@{a probability density function \(PDF\)}@} that {@{solely depends on the Euclidean distance and decreases with the distance}@}.

After the receiver has {@{acquired the demodulated, digitized version of the input waveform $y(t)$}@}, it computes {@{its projection onto the
$D$-dimensional basis $\{\phi_i(t)\}$}@} to form {@{a
signal space vector $$\mathbf{y}_n=\bigl[\langle y,\phi_1\rangle,
\dots ,\langle y,\phi_D\rangle\bigr]^T \,.$$}@} The receiver then evaluates {@{the Euclidean distance between this vector}@} and {@{every candidate point $s_i$ in the underlying constellation}@}: {@{$$d(\mathbf{y}_n,s_i)=\|\mathbf{y}_n-s_i\|_2, \quad i=1,\dots ,\mu \,.$$}@} {@{The output symbol}@} is simply {@{the index of the point with the smallest
distance}@}: {@{$$s^*=\arg\min_{i}\,d(\mathbf{y}_n,s_i) \,.$$}@}

{@{The above detector}@} can {@{further be simplified}@}. Notice {@{the distance $d(\mathbf y_n, s_i)$}@} can be rewritten as: {@{$$\begin{aligned} d(\mathbf y_n, s_i) & = \lVert \mathbf y_n \rVert^2 + \lVert s_i \rVert^2 - 2 \langle \mathbf y_n, s_i \rangle \\ & = \lVert \mathbf y_n \rVert^2 + E_i - 2 \int_0^T y_n(t) s^*_i(t) \,\mathrm dt \end{aligned}$$}@} So {@{minimizing distance}@} is equivalent to {@{maximizing $$ \int_0^T y_n(t) s^*_i(t) \,\mathrm dt - \frac {E_m} 2 \,.$$}@} That is, instead of {@{projecting onto the _normalized_ basis \(consisting of the symbol waveforms $s_i(t)$ with energy scaling\)}@}, {@{project onto the _unnormalized_ basis \(consisting of the symbol waveform $s_i(t)$ without energy scaling\)}@}. Then, subtract {@{$E_i / 2$ from the $i$-coordinate for all coordinates}@}, and {@{choose the index with the maximum value}@}. Note that {@{the noise variance in this unnormalized basis}@} is {@{scaled by the signal energy $E_i$, i.e. $E_i \frac {N_0} 2$}@}.

#### error analysis for minimum distance  

Using {@{the minimum distance rule}@} (assuming {@{equiprobable bits and AWGN noise}@}), for {@{a _pairwise_ error event}@}, {@{the probability that $\mathbf{s}_i$ is mistaken for $\mathbf{s}_j$}@} is {@{$$P_{ij}=Q\!\left(\frac{\|\mathbf{s}_i-\mathbf{s}_j\|}{2\sigma}\right) = Q\!\left(\sqrt {\frac {\lVert \mathbf s_i - \mathbf s_j \rVert^2} {2 N_0} } \right) \,,$$}@} where {@{$Q(\cdot)$ is the Gaussian tail function and $\sigma^2=N_0/2$}@}. {@{An upper bound for the probability $P_i$ that $\mathbf{s}_i$ is mistaken for any other symbol}@} can be found by {@{taking the union bound}@}: {@{$P_i \le \sum_{j \ne i} P_{ij}$}@}. {@{Equiprobable bits}@} imply {@{$P_e = P_i \le \sum_{j \ne i} P_{ij}$}@}. {@{The overall error probability}@} is {@{_dominated_ by the smallest inter-symbol distance}@}: {@{$$P_e \le \sum_{j \ne i} P_{ij} \approx Q\!\left(\frac{d_{\min} }{2\sigma}\right) = Q\!\left(\sqrt {\frac {d_{\text{min} } } {2 N_0} } \right) \,.$$}@} Note {@{the approximation sign in the equation}@}, which makes {@{the expressions on the right of the approximation sign}@} not {@{ upper bounds}@}. {@{A different way to analyze the error}@} is presented below, which {@{can prove said expressions are indeed upper bounds}@}.

{@{A much more _simple_ and _intuitive_ error analysis}@} for the minimum distance rule (under {@{equiprobable bits and AWGN noise}@}) can be made by {@{considering the constellation diagram}@}. Given {@{the minimum pairwise distance $d_{\text{min} }$}@}, the noise must {@{make the signal vector differ by at least $\frac {d_{\text{min} } } 2$}@} for {@{potential errors to occur}@}. So {@{the actual error probability $P_e$}@} must be _at most_ {@{$$\boxed{P_e \le Q\left(\frac {d_{\text{min} } } {2 \sigma_n} \right) = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac {d_{\text{min} }^2 } {2N_0} } \right) }\,,$$}@} as {@{the noise variance $\sigma_n^2$ in the constellation diagram}@} is {@{$N_0 / 2$ as above}@}. {@{Equality holds}@} {@{if and only if all symbols have the same pairwise distances}@}.

### effects of bandwidth and power

{@{Increasing bandwidth}@} _directly_ {@{raises the attainable baud rate}@} because {@{the symbol rate}@} is {@{bounded by the available spectral width}@}.  Consequently, {@{the bit rate $R = \frac {\log_2 M} {T_s} \propto B$}@} grows {@{linearly with bandwidth $B$}@}, where {@{$M$ denotes the modulation order}@}. In {@{schemes such as M-ary FSK}@}, {@{enlarging $B$}@} can {@{_indirectly_ expand the dimensionality of the signal space}@}, effectively {@{increasing the minimum Euclidean distance between symbols}@} for {@{a fixed energy per bit $E_b/N_0$}@}; {@{this geometric separation}@} reduces {@{the symbol error probability}@} at {@{the expense of occupying more spectrum}@}.

{@{Increasing transmit power}@} _directly_ {@{improves reliability and permits higher spectral efficiency}@} without {@{expanding bandwidth}@}.  By raising {@{the signal-to-noise ratio}@}, {@{the minimum distance $d_{\min}$ between constellation points}@} can be {@{enlarged}@}, {@{lowering the error probability}@} while {@{keeping the bit rate unchanged}@}. Alternatively, {@{a higher power budget}@} {@{_indirectly_ allows the use of denser constellations}@} (e.g., moving {@{from 8-PSK to 16-QAM}@}), which {@{doubles the bit rate for the same symbol rate}@}; {@{the additional symbols}@} are {@{distinguishable}@} because {@{the larger transmit amplitude}@} compensates for {@{the reduced inter-symbol spacing}@}.

### decision regions

In {@{_any_ demodulation scheme}@} {@{each possible transmitted symbol $s_i$}@} is associated with {@{a distinct decision region $\mathcal{R}_i$ in the signal space $\mathbf{y}$}@}. Thus, it may be used to {@{prove optimal detection under certain conditions}@}.

Assuming {@{_equiprobable_ bits and AWGN noise}@}, {@{the minimum distance detection rule}@} is optimal. {@{The vector space \(signal space\)}@} is {@{partitioned into _Voronoi cells_ around each constellation point}@}, which are called {@{_decision regions_}@}. When {@{a received signal falls into a cell}@}, the rule will {@{choose the constellation point inside the cell}@}. {@{The boundary between two symbols}@} is {@{the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining them}@}; {@{all points on one side}@} are {@{closer to one symbol than the other}@}. When there are {@{multiple symbols}@}, {@{these perpendicular bisectors}@} intersect to form {@{vertices adjacent to three or more cells}@}.

### maximum likelihood

For {@{a digital transmitter}@} that can send {@{one of $M$ symbols $\{s_1,\dots ,s_M\}$}@}, let {@{$p(s_i)$}@} denote {@{the a priori probability of symbol $s_i$}@}.  If {@{$s_j$ is transmitted}@}, {@{the conditional error probability given an observation $\mathbf y$}@} equals {@{$$P_e(s_j)=1-\int_{\mathcal R_j} p(\mathbf y|s_j) \,\mathrm d\mathbf y \,,$$}@} where {@{$\{\mathcal R_1,\dots ,\mathcal R_M\}$}@} is {@{the partition of observation space into decision regions}@}. {@{Averaging over all possible transmitted symbols}@} yields {@{$$P_e=\sum_{i=1}^{M}p(s_i)\left[\,1-\!\!\sum_{\mathcal R_i} p(\mathbf y|s_i) \,\mathrm d\mathbf y \right] = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^M \int_{\mathcal R_i} p(s_i) p(\mathbf y | s_i) \,\mathrm d\mathbf y \,.$$}@} Because {@{each observation $\mathbf y$}@} belongs to {@{exactly one region}@}, for {@{every $\mathbf y$}@} we choose {@{the symbol $s_k$ that maximizes the posterior}@}: {@{$$p(s_k|\mathbf y)=\frac{p(\mathbf y|s_k)\,p(s_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^{M}p(\mathbf y|s_j)p(s_j)} \,.$$}@} Since {@{the denominator}@} is {@{common to all candidates}@}, this is equivalent to {@{maximizing $p(\mathbf y|s_k)p(s_k)$}@}, so {@{the error probability $P_e$ given by the above formula}@} is {@{minimized}@}.

When {@{all symbols are equiprobable}@} ({@{$p(s_k)=1/M$}@}), {@{the factor $p(s_k)$ becomes constant}@} and {@{the decision rule}@} simplifies to {@{$$\hat{s}_{\text{ML} }=\arg\max_{s}\; p(\mathbf y|s) \,,$$}@} which is {@{the _maximum likelihood_ (ML) detection criterion}@}, so-called because {@{$p(\mathbf y|s)$ is the _likelihood function_}@}. For {@{additive white Gaussian noise}@} this corresponds to choosing {@{the constellation point closest in Euclidean distance to the received signal}@}.

In {@{an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel}@}, {@{the conditional probability density}@} of receiving {@{a vector $\mathbf y$ given that symbol $s_i$ was transmitted}@} is {@{$$p(\mathbf y|s_i)=\frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{n/2} }\exp\!\left(-\frac {\|\mathbf y-s_i\|^2} {(2\sigma^2)}\right) \,,$$}@} where {@{$\sigma^2$ is the noise variance and $n$ is the dimension of the signal space}@}.  Taking {@{the natural logarithm}@} turns {@{the exponential into a quadratic form}@}: {@{$$\ln p(\mathbf y|s_i)= -\frac {\|\mathbf y-s_i\|^2} {2\sigma^2} +\text{constant} \,.$$}@}  Because {@{the constant term}@} does not {@{depend on $i$}@}, {@{maximizing the likelihood}@} is equivalent to {@{minimizing the squared Euclidean distance $\|\mathbf y-s_i\|^2$}@} between {@{the received point and each constellation symbol}@}.  Thus, under {@{equiprobable bits and AWGN}@}, {@{the maximum likelihood detector}@} reduces to {@{a nearest-neighbour rule in Euclidean space}@}.

## implementation

### complexity

When moving from {@{binary to $M$-ary modulation}@}, {@{the receiver design}@} must handle {@{an expanded symbol set}@} while still {@{distinguishing each point accurately}@}. For {@{M-ary ASK}@}, {@{the simplest approach}@} is {@{a _non-coherent_ energy detector}@} that {@{merely measures signal power}@}; this keeps {@{hardware minimal and inexpensive}@}, as seen in {@{remote-control IR systems}@}. Because {@{all symbols share the same carrier phase}@}, {@{the receiver}@} does not need a {@{PLL or carrier recovery circuit}@}, which would otherwise add {@{cost and design complexity}@}.

In contrast, {@{M-ary PSK schemes}@} require {@{coherent detection}@}: {@{the receiver}@} must track {@{the instantaneous carrier phase}@} (via {@{a PLL or similar phase-locked loop}@}) to {@{correctly demodulate each symbol}@}. {@{This requirement}@} grows {@{with $M$}@}, as {@{the constellation points}@} become {@{more tightly packed on the unit circle}@}, demanding {@{finer phase resolution}@} and thus more {@{sophisticated analog front-end circuitry}@}. Consequently, while PSK offers {@{superior energy efficiency per bit}@}, {@{its implementation}@} becomes {@{increasingly complex for large $M$}@}, forcing designers to balance {@{theoretical gains against practical hardware constraints}@}.

### peak-to-average power ratio

In {@{real-world radio front ends}@}, {@{power amplifiers (PAs)}@} exhibit {@{nonlinear behavior}@}: {@{signals whose instantaneous amplitude}@} {@{exceeds the linear region}@} are {@{clipped}@}, producing {@{spectral regrowth \(unwanted bandwidth broadening\)}@} that violates {@{regulatory emission masks}@}. To keep {@{the output within the linear band}@}, {@{transmitters}@} employ {@{_power back-off_}@}, reducing {@{the average output level}@} so that {@{even peak samples}@} remain in {@{the amplifier's linear range}@}. {@{The amount of back-off required}@} is governed by {@{the signal's peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)}@}.

{@{The _peak-to-average power ratio_\(PAPR\)}@} is {@{the peak amplitude squared \(giving the peak _power_\)}@} divided by {@{the RMS value squared \(giving the average _power_\)}@}.

{@{Phase-shift keying (PSK) constellations}@} maintain {@{a constant envelope}@}, yielding {@{a low PAPR of roughly 3&nbsp;dB \(average power is about half of peak power\)}@}. {@{Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)}@}, by contrast, varies {@{both amplitude and phase across its symbols}@}, resulting in {@{a higher PAPR around 10&nbsp;dB}@}. Consequently, {@{QAM signals}@} demand {@{more back-off}@}—typically {@{about 7&nbsp;dB greater than PSK}@}—to avoid {@{PA clipping}@}, which can diminish {@{the usable output power}@} or increase {@{amplifier stress}@} unless mitigated by {@{design adjustments}@}.  

For example, {@{A typical Wi-Fi radio}@} contains {@{a single PA}@} capable of {@{up to 30&nbsp;dBm output}@}. For {@{low-order modes}@} (e.g. {@{BPSK, QPSK, APSK}@}) {@{the average transmit power}@} sits {@{around 26&nbsp;dBm}@}, representing {@{roughly a 4&nbsp;dB back-off from peak capability}@}. {@{Higher-order modulations}@} such as {@{16-QAM or 64-QAM}@} drop to {@{about 20&nbsp;dBm}@} because they require {@{a larger back-off}@} to {@{accommodate their higher PAPR}@}.
