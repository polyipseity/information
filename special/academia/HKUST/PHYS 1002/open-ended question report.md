# open-ended question report

- HKUST PHYS 1002

Submit a pdf/docx/doc file of an individual report with a maximum of 500 words and its topic must be chosen from one of the open-ended questions posted (i.e., only ONE report is required for each student).

- __deadline of submission of written report: 11:59 pm on 10 Aug 2024__

## late submission

Marks will be deducted for late submission of the OEQ according to the following formula:

For submissions that are late for _N_ days

Score = Original Score * (1 - 0.2 × _N_) for _N_ = 1, 2, 3, 4

Score = 0 for _N_ >= 5

For example, reports submitted from 10 Aug 11:59:01pm to 11 Aug 11:59:00pm will be counted as late for _N_ = 1 day and Score = Original Score × 0.8.

## policy on using generative AI

Students are prohibited from using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to produce any materials or content in their written report.

## marking scheme

Please review more details in ["Marking Scheme of Written Report Open-ended Question"](https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/57202/files/9139393) posted.

- __remark - clarification to "Title Page"__: It should contain the title of the report, author's name, institution & its address and email address of the author.

### details

| __Assessments of the Written Report__                 | __Points__ |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Title page (Abstract is not required)                 | 5          |
| Main idea or opinion about the question               | 25         |
| Details and Evidence/Examples/Arguments of the answer | 40         |
| Conclusion                                            | 10         |
| Organization of the report                            | 10         |
| English use (grammar, usage and punctuation)          | 10         |
| __TOTAL__                                             | __100__    |

__Remarks__:

1. The title page should only contain the title of the report, author's name, institution, address of the institution and author's contact information. As the report has a maximum length of 500 words, an abstract is not required in the title page and we will not count the words in the title page.
2. The conclusion should be a concise summary of the whole report.
3. As the enrolled students of this course have a broad spectrum, any citation format (such as APA, IEEE, CSE.....) is acceptable as long as the details of the references are given.
4. If students could provide their own explanation and discussion on the chosen open-ended question without mentioning any previous work, then citation of references becomes unnecessary.
