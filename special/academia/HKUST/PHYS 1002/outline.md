- [Hubble Ultra-Deep Field](../../../../general/Hubble%20Ultra-Deep%20Field.md)
- HKUST in the universe ::: HKUST is a very small place compared to the universe
- observing HKUST ::: different views depending on where we are and where we look, so multiple observations are required to reveal the true HKUST
- observing the universe ::: unfortunately, we can only observe the universe from the inside at one (almost) fixed location; see 蘇軾《題西林壁》
  - Does that mean we will never understand the universe? ::: Not quite, we have a good but not perfect understanding of our universe, and can construct a 3D or 4D model of it.
- old world maps ::: can be very different due to limited technology; compare a world map believed to be compiled by Zheng He (1371–1435) and the Martellus world map (1490)
- "cosmic address" ::: the universe -> Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex (galaxy filament and void) -> Local Supercluster -> Local Group -> Milky Way (galaxy) -> Solar System -> Earth -> ...
- the universe in numbers ::: the [observable universe](../../../../general/observable%20universe.md): ~10<sup>11</sup> galaxies, each galaxy: ~10<sup>11</sup> stars
- astronomical structures
  - [star](../../../../general/star.md) ::: A large, glowing ball of gas that generates heat and light via nuclear fusion.
    - star surface ::: bubbling convection cells that rise and fall across the surface
      - star surface example ::: the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), with ~700&nbsp;000 km<sup>2</sup> cells, observed by [Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope](../../../../Daniel%20K.%20Inouye%20Solar%20Telescope.md)
    - [convection zone](../../../../general/convection%20zone.md) ::: ...where heat flow mainly consists of [convection](../../../../general/convection%20(heat%20transfer).md)
    - [radiation zone](../../../../general/radiation%20zone.md) ::: ...where heat flow mainly consists of [radiation](../../../../general/radiation.md) and [conduction](../../../../thermal%20conduction.md)
      - radiation zone radiation detection ::: The radiation from the radiation zone can be detected and analyzed via [astronomical spectroscopy](../../../../astronomical%20spectroscopy.md). This produces a spectrum, which is _mostly_ similar to a [black body](../../../../general/black%20body.md), but the _small_ differences are significant and tell us about many properties of the [star](../../../../general/star.md).
  - [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) ::: A moderately large object that orbits a [star](../../../../general/star.md). It shines by reflecting light from the star. It may be rocky, icy, or gaseous in composition.
    - planet examples ::: [Mars](../../../../general/Mars.md) ([rocky planet](../../../../general/terrestrial%20planet.md)), [Jupiter](../../../../general/Jupiter.md) ([gas giant](../../../../general/gas%20giant.md)), [Neptune](../../../../general/Neptune.md) ([ice giant](../../../../general/ice%20giant.md))
  - [dwarf planet](../../../../general/dwarf%20planet.md)
    - dwarf planet examples ::: [Eris](../../../../general/Eris%20(dwarf%20planet).md), [Pluto](../../../../general/Pluto.md) (reclassified in 2006), major objects in the [Kuiper Belt](../../../../general/Kuiper%20belt.md)
  - long orbital periods ::: 1 Pluto year ≈ 248.1 Earth years, 1 Eris year ≈ 557 Earth years
  - [asteroid](../../../../general/asteroid.md) ::: A relatively small and _rocky_ object orbiting a [star](../../../../general/star.md). Often non-spherical due to insufficient gravity. It is a [minor planet](../../../../general/minor%20planet.md) that orbits within the [inner Solar System](../../../../general/Solar%20System.md#inner%20Solar%20System).
    - asteroid examples ::: many asteroids in the [Kuiper Belt](../../../../general/Kuiper%20Belt.md)
  - [comet](../../../../general/comet.md) ::: A relatively small and _icy_ object that orbits a [star](../../../../general/star.md). The heat from the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) melts the ice to form the tail when the comet is close.
    - asteroid vs. comet ::: The basic difference is its composition: rocky vs. icy.
  - [natural satellite](../../../../general/natural%20satellite.md) or moon ::: An object that orbits a [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) or [dwarf planet](../../../../general/dwarf%20planet.md). (Man-made objects are simply called _satellites_.)
    - natural satellite examples ::: [Ganymede](../../../../general/Ganymede%20(moon).md) ([Jupiter](../../../../general/Jupiter.md)), the [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) ([Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md))
  - [planetary system](../../../../general/planetary%20system.md) (misnomer: [star system](../../../../general/star%20system.md)) ::: A [star](../../../../general/star.md) and all the materials that [orbits](orbit.md) it, including its [planets](../../../../general/planet.md) and [moons](../../../../general/natural%20satellite.md).
    - planetary system examples ::: [Solar System](../../../../general/Solar%20System.md)
  - [nebula](../../../../general/nebula.md) ::: An interstellar cloud of gas and/or dust.
  - [galaxy](../../../../general/galaxy.md) ::: A great island of (on average 10<sup>11</sup>) [stars](../../../../general/star.md) bound together by [gravity](../../../../general/gravity.md) and [orbiting](orbit.md) a common center.
    - galaxy examples ::: [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md)
  - [galaxy group](../../../../general/galaxy%20group.md) ::: A collection of _50 or fewer_ [galaxies](../../../../general/galaxy.md) bound by [gravity](../../../../general/gravity.md).
    - galaxy group examples ::: [Local Group](../../../../geneeral/Local%20Group.md)
  - [galaxy cluster](../../../../general/galaxy%20cluster.md) ::: A collection of _more than 50_ [galaxies](../../../../general/galaxy.md) bound by [gravity](../../../../general/gravity.md).
  - [supercluster](../../../../general/supercluster.md) ::: A gigantic region of [space](../../../../general/outer%20space.md) in which many groups and clusters are packed more closely together (not necessarily bounded by [gravity](../../../../general/gravity.md)) than elsewhere.
    - supercluster examples ::: [Local Supercluster](../../../../general/Virgo%20Supercluster.md)
  - [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) ::: The totality of everything that exists, including space, time, matter, and energy.
- [mass–energy equivalence](../../../../general/mass–energy%20equivalence.md) ::: $E = mc^2$: mass and energy are equivalent (differ only by a multiplicative constant and the units of measurement)
- brief history of the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) ::: [Big Bang](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md) (13.8 billion years ago) -> galaxy formation -> star evolution (cycle: formation -> fuel consumption -> death) -> Earth
  - How to know what [Hong Kong](../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md) was like in the past? ::: Look at historic photos of [Hong Kong](../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md).
  - How to know what the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) was like in the past? ::: Look far enough, because the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) is extremely big.
- [speed of light](../../../../general/speed%20of%20light.md) ::: exactly 299&nbsp;792&nbsp;458 m/s _in vacuum_, often approximated as 300&nbsp;000 km/s; 8 times around the Earth in 1 second
  - light travel time from Earth to... ::: the Moon: 1 second, the Sun: ~8 minutes, Sirius (brightest star in the night sky): 8 years, Andromeda Galaxy (nearest major galaxy): 2.5 million years
  - speed of light implications ::: We see astronomical objects as they were in the past since they are so far away. The further the object is in distance, the further back we look back into time.
- [lookback time](../../../../general/cosmic%20time.md#lookback%20time)
- [light-year](../../../../general/light-year.md) ::: the distance light travels in one year; exactly 9460&nbsp;730&nbsp;472&nbsp;580&nbsp;800 m, approximately 9.4607 × 10<sup>15</sup> m
  - light-year unofficial variation ::: We use 365 days in a year instead of 365.25 to calculate 1 light-year in the PowerPoint. But 365.25 should be acceptable either way...
- [observable universe](../../../../general/observable%20universe.md) ::: It has a radius (in [comoving distance](../../../../general/comoving%20and%20proper%20distances.md)) of 46.5 billion light-years instead of 13.8 billion light-years due to expansion of the universe.
  - Can we see the entire [universe](../../../../general/universe.md)? ::: No. Estimates suggest that the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) is at least 250 times larger (in volume) than a [Hubble sphere](../../../../general/Hubble%20volume.md).
- [scale of the universe @ HKUST](scale%20of%20the%20universe%20@%20HKUST.md) ::: a 1:10<sup>10</sup> (length) model
- number of stars in the [observable universe](../../../../general/observable%20universe.md) ::: 10<sup>11</sup> stars/galaxy × 10<sup>11</sup> galaxies = 10<sup>22</sup> stars
  - number of stars in the [observable universe](../../../../general/observable%20universe.md) analogy ::: The [observable universe](../../../../general/observable%20universe.md) has as many stars as the number of grains of dry sand on all of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s beaches. Imagine the time needed to count each grain of sand 1 per second.
- [Cosmic Calendar](../../../../general/Cosmic%20Calendar.md) ::: Compress the entire history of the universe till now (13.8 billion years) into 1 year. 1 month ≈ 1.2 billion yrs, 1 day ≈ 40 million yrs, 1 sec ≈ 440 yrs
  - Cosmic Calendar highlights ::: The [Solar System](../../../../general/Solar%20System.md) formed on September. Dinosaurs appeared on Christmas (25 Dec) and extincted yesterday (30 Dec). All of recorded human history occurred in the last 30 seconds. We (age of ~20) were born 0.05 seconds before.
- Are we ever standing still? ::: No! Consider the movement of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md), the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), and [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md).
- movement of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::: [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md), [Earth's orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md), movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)
  - [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md) ::: [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) rotates on its axis once very day (~24 h). Its [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) is about 23.5°, pointing to [Polaris](../../../../general/Polaris.md).
  - [Earth's orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md) ::: [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) orbits the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) once a year at an average distance of 1 [AU](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md), in counterclockwise direction as viewed from above.
    - [astronomical unit](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md) ::: 1 [AU](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md) = 149&nbsp;597&nbsp;870&nbsp;700 m ≈ 150 million km
    - Earth's orbital speed ::: Surprisingly quick, 29.78 km/s or 107&nbsp;200 km/h
  - Why do we not feel the movement of Earth even if it is moving very quickly? ::: Although Earth moves very quickly, its acceleration is very little. As we feel acceleration but not velocity, we do not feel the Earth moving. (Imagine riding on trains which are respectively accelerating, in constant velocity, and decelerating.) For [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md), consider that the [angular velocity](../../../../general/angular%20velocity.md) is very small.
  - [angular velocity](../../../../general/angular%20velocity.md) ::: Angular velocity is $\omega = \frac {v_{\perp} } r$, where $v_{\perp}$ is the signed (+: counterclockwise, -: clockwise) magnitude of the tangential velocity and $r$ is the radius from the rotation center.
- movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) ::: [solar apex](../../../../general/solar%20apex.md), [orbit of the Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md#motion), movement of the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md)
  - [solar apex § direction](../../../../general/solar%20apex.md#direction) ::: The [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) moves relative to the local solar neighborhood ([local standard of rest](../../../../general/local%20standard%20of%20rest.md)) at about 72&nbsp;000 km/h. (Actually, this was the measured speed before 1986, but we will use it here anyway.)
  - [orbit of the Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md#motion) ::: The [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) orbits around the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) center about every 230 million years at a speed of about 800&nbsp;000 km/h.
  - Why do we not notice the movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) even if it is moving extremely quickly? ::: This is because the distance between [stars](../../../../general/star.md) is even larger. In a 1:10<sup>10</sup> model, the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)'s speed 70&nbsp;000 km/h is 0.7 cm/h. Compare this to the scaled distance of 4400 km (4.4 ly) between the Sun and [Alpha Centauri](../../../../general/Alpha%20Centauri.md). One implication is that stars appear to be stationary over lifetimes of many generations, allowing the concept of [constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md).
- [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) fun fact ::: While most of the light come from the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md)'s bulge and disk, most of its mass is in its halo. ([dark matter](../../../../general/dark%20matter.md))
- movement of the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) ::: [approaching the Andromeda Galaxy](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md#intergalactic%20neighborhood), [Hubble's law](../../../../general/Hubble's%20law.md)
  - [approaching the Andromeda Galaxy](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md#intergalactic%20neighborhood) ::: at about 300&nbsp;300 km/h
  - [Hubble's law](../../../../general/Hubble's%20law.md) ::: Attributed to [Edwin Hubble](../../../../general/Edwin%20Hubble.md). All [galaxies](../../../../general/galaxy.md) outside our [Local Group](../../../../general/Local%20Group.md) are moving away from us, with the speeds proportional to their distances.
    - Hubble's law implications ::: An evidence for the [expansion of the universe](../../../../general/expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md). Consider [raisins](../../../../general/raisin.md) (galaxies) in a rising loaf of bread (the universe). Raisins further apart from each other move away from each other faster.
