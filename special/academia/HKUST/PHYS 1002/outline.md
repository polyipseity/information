      - radiation zone radiation detection ::: The radiation from the radiation zone can be detected and analyzed via [astronomical spectroscopy](../../../../astronomical%20spectroscopy.md). This produces a spectrum, which is _mostly_ similar to a [black body](../../../../general/black%20body.md), but the _small_ differences are significant and tell us about many properties of the [star](../../../../general/star.md). <!--SR:!2024-09-17,64,310!2024-08-28,45,290-->

  - [comet](../../../../general/comet.md) ::: A relatively small and _icy_ object that orbits a [star](../../../../general/star.md). The heat from the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) melts the ice to form the tail when the comet is close. <!--SR:!2024-07-16,16,290!2024-09-06,54,310-->
    - asteroid vs. comet ::: The basic difference is its composition: rocky vs. icy. <!--SR:!2024-08-28,45,290!2024-09-03,51,310-->
  - [natural satellite](../../../../general/natural%20satellite.md) or moon ::: An object that orbits a [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) or [dwarf planet](../../../../general/dwarf%20planet.md). (Man-made objects are simply called _satellites_.) <!--SR:!2024-08-25,45,290!2024-09-05,53,310-->

    - supercluster examples ::: [Local Supercluster](../../../../general/Virgo%20Supercluster.md) <!--SR:!2024-08-18,38,290!2024-09-05,53,310-->
  - [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) ::: The totality of everything that exists, including space, time, matter, and energy. <!--SR:!2024-07-16,16,290!2024-09-01,49,310-->
- [mass–energy equivalence](../../../../general/mass–energy%20equivalence.md) ::: $$E = mc^2$$: mass and energy are equivalent (differ only by a multiplicative constant and the units of measurement) <!--SR:!2024-09-07,55,310!2024-08-17,37,290-->
- brief history of the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) ::: [Big Bang](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md) (13.8 billion years ago) -> galaxy formation -> star evolution (cycle: formation -> fuel consumption -> death) -> Earth <!--SR:!2024-08-23,40,290!2024-08-23,40,290-->
  - How to know what [Hong Kong](../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md) was like in the past? ::: Look at historic photos of [Hong Kong](../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md). <!--SR:!2024-09-04,52,310!2024-09-06,54,310-->

- [speed of light](../../../../general/speed%20of%20light.md) ::: exactly 299&nbsp;792&nbsp;458 m/s _in vacuum_, often approximated as 300&nbsp;000 km/s; 8 times around the Earth in 1 second <!--SR:!2024-08-27,43,290!2024-09-16,63,310-->
  - light travel time from Earth to... ::: the Moon: ~1.3 second, the Sun: ~8 minutes, Sirius (brightest star in the night sky): ~8 years, Andromeda Galaxy (nearest major galaxy): ~2.5 million years <!--SR:!2024-08-03,25,270!2024-08-24,41,290-->
  - speed of light implications ::: We see astronomical objects as they were in the past since they are so far away. The further the object is in distance, the further back we look back into time. <!--SR:!2024-09-12,60,310!2024-09-02,50,310-->
- [lookback time](../../../../general/cosmic%20time.md#lookback%20time)
- [light-year](../../../../general/light-year.md) ::: the distance light travels in one year; exactly 9460&nbsp;730&nbsp;472&nbsp;580&nbsp;800 m, approximately 9.4607 × 10<sup>15</sup> m <!--SR:!2024-07-17,6,190!2024-08-27,44,290-->
  - light-year unofficial variation ::: We use 365 days in a year instead of 365.25 to calculate 1 light-year in the PowerPoint. But 365.25 should be acceptable either way... <!--SR:!2024-07-16,16,290!2024-07-16,16,290-->
- [observable universe](../../../../general/observable%20universe.md) ::: It has a radius (in [comoving distance](../../../../general/comoving%20and%20proper%20distances.md)) of 46.5 billion light-years instead of 13.8 billion light-years due to expansion of the universe. <!--SR:!2024-07-21,7,270!2024-08-19,39,290-->
  - Can we see the entire [universe](../../../../general/universe.md)? ::: No. Estimates suggest that the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) is at least 250 times larger (in volume) than a [Hubble sphere](../../../../general/Hubble%20volume.md). <!--SR:!2024-09-15,62,310!2024-09-04,52,310-->
- [scale of the universe @ HKUST](scale%20of%20the%20universe%20@%20HKUST.md) ::: a 1:10<sup>10</sup> (length) model <!--SR:!2024-07-17,17,308!2024-07-18,18,308-->

## week 1 lecture 2

- time: 2024-06-20T10:00:00+08:00/2024-06-20T12:30:00+08:00
- [Cosmic Calendar](../../../../general/Cosmic%20Calendar.md) ::: Compress the entire history of the universe till now (13.8 billion years) into 1 year. 1 month ≈ 1.2 billion yrs, 1 day ≈ 40 million yrs, 1 sec ≈ 440 yrs <!--SR:!2024-07-30,22,268!2024-09-18,65,328-->
  - Cosmic Calendar highlights ::: The [Solar System](../../../../general/Solar%20System.md) formed on September. Dinosaurs appeared on Christmas (25 Dec) and extincted yesterday (30 Dec). All of recorded human history occurred in the last 30 seconds. We (age of ~20) were born 0.05 seconds before. <!--SR:!2024-08-15,35,288!2024-07-18,18,308-->
- Are we ever standing still? ::: No! Consider the movement of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md), the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), and [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md). <!--SR:!2024-09-13,61,328!2024-07-17,17,308-->
- movement of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::: [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md), [Earth's orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md), movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) <!--SR:!2024-08-08,28,288!2024-07-16,16,308-->
  - [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md) ::: [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) rotates on its axis once very day (~24 h). Its [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) is about 23.5°, pointing to [Polaris](../../../../general/Polaris.md). <!--SR:!2024-08-12,32,288!2024-07-18,18,308-->
  - [Earth's orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md) ::: [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) orbits the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) once a year at an average distance of 1 [AU](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md), in counterclockwise direction as viewed from above. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-16,16,308-->
    - [astronomical unit](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md) ::: 1 [AU](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md) = 149&nbsp;597&nbsp;870&nbsp;700 m ≈ 150 million km <!--SR:!2024-07-27,16,228!2024-07-17,17,308-->
    - Earth's orbital speed ::: surprisingly quick, 29.78 km/s or 107&nbsp;200 km/h <!--SR:!2024-07-19,12,248!2024-07-17,17,308-->
  - Why do we not feel the movement of Earth even if it is moving very quickly? ::: Although Earth moves very quickly, its acceleration is very little. As we feel acceleration but not velocity, we do not feel the Earth moving. (Imagine riding on trains which are respectively accelerating, in constant velocity, and decelerating.) For [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md), consider that the [angular velocity](../../../../general/angular%20velocity.md) is very small. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-18,18,308-->
  - [angular velocity](../../../../general/angular%20velocity.md) ::: Angular velocity is $\omega = \frac {v_{\perp} } r$, where $v_{\perp}$ is the signed (+: counterclockwise, -: clockwise) magnitude of the tangential velocity and $r$ is the radius from the rotation center. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-17,17,308-->
- movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) ::: [solar apex](../../../../general/solar%20apex.md), [orbit of the Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md#motion), movement of the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-16,16,308-->
  - [solar apex § direction](../../../../general/solar%20apex.md#direction) ::: The [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) moves relative to the local solar neighborhood ([local standard of rest](../../../../general/local%20standard%20of%20rest.md)) at about 72&nbsp;000 km/h. (Actually, this was the measured speed before 1986, but we will use it here anyway.) <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-08-13,33,288-->
  - [orbit of the Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md#motion) ::: The [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) orbits around the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) center about every 230 million years at a speed of about 800&nbsp;000 km/h. <!--SR:!2024-08-15,35,288!2024-09-03,50,308-->
  - Why do we not notice the movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) even if it is moving extremely quickly? ::: This is because the distance between [stars](../../../../general/star.md) is even larger. In a 1:10<sup>10</sup> model, the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)'s speed 70&nbsp;000 km/h is 0.7 cm/h. Compare this to the scaled distance of 4400 km (4.4 ly) between the Sun and [Alpha Centauri](../../../../general/Alpha%20Centauri.md). One implication is that stars appear to be stationary over lifetimes of many generations, allowing the concept of [constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-16,16,308!2024-07-18,18,308-->
- [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) fun fact ::: While most of the light come from the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md)'s bulge and disk, most of its mass is in its halo. ([dark matter](../../../../general/dark%20matter.md)) <!--SR:!2024-08-30,47,308!2024-07-16,16,308-->
- movement of the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) ::: [approaching the Andromeda Galaxy](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md#intergalactic%20neighborhood), [Hubble's law](../../../../general/Hubble's%20law.md) <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-18,18,308-->
  - [approaching the Andromeda Galaxy](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md#intergalactic%20neighborhood) ::: at about 300&nbsp;000 km/h <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-18,18,308-->
  - [Hubble's law](../../../../general/Hubble's%20law.md) ::: Attributed to [Edwin Hubble](../../../../general/Edwin%20Hubble.md). All [galaxies](../../../../general/galaxy.md) outside our [Local Group](../../../../general/Local%20Group.md) are moving away from us, with the speeds proportional to their distances. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-16,16,308-->
    - Hubble's law implications ::: An evidence for the [expansion of the universe](../../../../general/expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md). Consider [raisins](../../../../general/raisin.md) (galaxies) in a rising loaf of bread (the universe). Raisins further apart from each other move away from each other faster. <!--SR:!2024-07-16,16,308!2024-07-17,17,308-->
- recurring patterns on [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::: day: circling sky, month: phases of the [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md), year: 4 seasons <!--SR:!2024-07-16,14,313!2024-09-01,49,313-->
- How does the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) look like from [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) using the naked eye? ::: We can see more than 2000 [stars](../../../../general/star.md) as well as the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md). (Unfortunately, due to light pollution, many [stars](../../../../general/star.md) cannot be seen from [Hong Kong](../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md).) <!--SR:!2024-08-12,29,293!2024-09-06,53,313-->
- [constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md) ::: A region of the sky. There are 88 of them. Most names come from the imagination of ancient people. They are now used as landmarks by modern [astronomers](../../../../general/astronomer.md). <!--SR:!2024-08-17,34,293!2024-07-18,16,313-->
- [asterism](../../../../general/asterism%20(astronomy).md) ::: An observed pattern of [stars](../../../../general/star.md) in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md). More general than [constellations](../../../../general/constellation.md). <!--SR:!2024-09-05,52,313!2024-08-16,38,313-->
  - asterism examples ::: the [Big Dipper](../../../../general/Big%20Dipper.md), [Ursa Major](../../../../general/Ursa%20Major.md) ([constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md)) <!--SR:!2024-07-18,16,313!2024-07-17,15,313-->
  - the [Big Dipper](../../../../general/Big%20Dipper.md) ::: It consists of the 7 brightest stars of the constellation [Ursa Major](../../../../general/Ursa%20Major.md). (Also known as BeiDou (Chinese: 北斗). The [BeiDou](../../../../general/BeiDou.md) Navigation Satellite System (BDS) is named after it.) <!--SR:!2024-07-19,17,313!2024-08-30,47,313-->
- Are stars in an asterism or constellation of the same cluster and similar distance? ::: No! They can very far apart from each other, like many light-years away. <!--SR:!2024-07-20,18,313!2024-07-18,16,313-->
- motion of the [stars](../../../../general/star.md) ::: They go around us once per day, like how the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) rises and sets. <!--SR:!2024-07-20,18,313!2024-07-16,14,293-->
- [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) (Chinese: 天球) ::: An imaginary sphere with [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) as the center. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,17,313!2024-07-17,15,313-->
  - Why do stars appear to be fixed on the celestial sphere? And what are the exceptions? ::: Even if the stars (Chinese: 恆星 for 'unmoving star') are moving very quickly (described in km), their distances to us are even higher (described in ly), so they _appear_ fixed. The [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md), the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), and [planets](../../../../general/planet.md) (Chinese: 行星 for 'moving star') are much closer and moves slowly (but detectable to naked eyes) on the sphere. <!--SR:!2024-08-14,31,293!2024-07-16,14,313-->
  - horizon ::: plane tangent to the ground, depends on your location <!--SR:!2024-09-07,54,313!2024-08-30,47,313-->
  - [zenith](../../../../general/zenith.md) ::: point on the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) directly overhead, depends on your location <!--SR:!2024-07-20,18,313!2024-07-20,18,313-->

  - [celestial equator](../../../../general/celestial%20equator.md) ::: projection of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s equator onto the [celestial sphere](celestial%20sphere.md) <!--SR:!2024-07-20,18,313!2024-08-26,43,313-->
  - north [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md) ::: projection of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s north [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md) onto the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) <!--SR:!2024-08-27,44,313!2024-09-01,49,313-->
  - south [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md) ::: projection of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s south [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md) onto the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) <!--SR:!2024-08-20,40,313!2024-09-05,52,313-->
  - [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md) ::: the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)'s apparent path [eastward](../../../../general/east.md) through the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) during the year <!--SR:!2024-07-18,16,313!2024-07-20,18,313-->
- [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) ::: It equals the angle between the (celestial) [equatorial plane](../../../../general/equator.md) and the [ecliptic plane](../../../../general/ecliptic.md). For [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md), this angle is 23.5°. <!--SR:!2024-08-22,38,293!2024-08-24,41,313-->
- [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) [galaxy class](../../../../general/galaxy%20morphological%20classification.md) ::: [flat spiral galaxy](../../../../general/spiral%20galaxy.md) <!--SR:!2024-08-24,44,313!2024-07-17,15,313-->
- [galactic plane](../../../../general/galactic%20plane.md) ::: The [plane](../../../../general/plane%20(geometry).md) on which the majority of a disk-shaped [galaxy](../../../../general/galaxy.md)'s [mass](../../../../general/mass.md) lies. For us, the galactic plane of [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) blocks our view  of the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) outside the Milky Way in the direction parallel to the plane. <!--SR:!2024-08-21,37,293!2024-08-15,32,293-->

- [arcminute & arcsecond](../../../../general/minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc.md)
- [latitude](../../../../general/latitude.md), [longitude](../../../../general/longitude.md)

- [Earth-centered, Earth-fixed coordinate system](../../../../general/Earth-centered,%20Earth-fixed%20coordinate%20system.md) ::: Acronym is ECEF. It is a [cartesian](../../../../general/Cartesian%20coordinate%20system.md) [spatial reference system](../../../../general/spatial%20reference%20system.md) that represents location using _X_, _Y_, and _Z_ from the [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s [center of mass](../../../../general/center%20of%20mass.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-19,17,317!2024-08-18,35,297-->
- star movement
  - [celestial sphere § description](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md#description)
  - [diurnal motion](../../../../general/diurnal%20motion.md)
  - What do the [constellations](../../../../general/constellation.md) we see depend on? ::: One is the [latitude](../../../../general/latitude.md), as it determines the [horizon](../../../../general/horizon.md), and thus visible and hidden [stars](../../../../general/star.md). The other one is the time of year, because the [Sun](Sun.md) moves along the [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md) on the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) and stars are only visible at nighttime away from the Sun. <!--SR:!2024-08-14,31,297!2024-08-18,35,297-->
  - [circumpolar star](../../../../general/circumpolar%20star.md) ::: [Stars](../../../../general/star.md) that never sets below the [horizon](../../../../general/horizon.md), as observed from a specific location on [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-20,18,317!2024-07-16,14,297-->
  - altitude of the north [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md) equals... ::: ...equals your [latitude](../../../../general/latitude.md) (works even if the number is negative) <!--SR:!2024-08-24,41,317!2024-07-20,18,317-->
- [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md)
  - [§ finding the north celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md#finding%20the%20north%20celestial%20pole)
  - [§ finding the south celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md#finding%20the%20south%20celestial%20pole)
  - [§ method one: the Southern Cross](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md#method%20one%20the%20Southern%20Cross)
- [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md)
  - [§ astrology](../../../../general/ecliptic.md#astrology)
  - [zodiac](../../../../general/zodiac.md)
    - zodiac § [Ophiuchus](../../../../general/Ophiuchus.md) ::: The feet of [Ophiuchus](../../../../general/Ophiuchus.md) touches the [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md) and is in between [Sagittarius](../../../../general/Sagittarius%20(constellation).md) and [Scorpius](../../../../general/Scorpius.md), but is not in the 12 [zodiac signs](../../../../general/astrological%20sign.md). (Note that zodiac signs do not actually correspond to the [constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md) boundaries in general, due to the [axial precession](../../../../general/axial%20precession.md) of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). Thus, it is not the "13th zodiac sign"). <!--SR:!2024-08-16,33,297!2024-08-17,34,297-->
    - [astrological sign](../../../../general/astrological%20sign.md) ::: [Pseudoscience](../../../../general/pseudoscience.md). The 12 signs are named after 12 of the [constellations](../../../../general/constellation.md) touching the [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md). Note that the time of the signs do not correspond with the positions of the constellations in general. <!--SR:!2024-08-15,32,297!2024-07-17,15,317-->
- [solar time](../../../../general/solar%20time.md) ::: Similar to the "time" we are familiar with. It is based on the [position of the Sun](../../../../general/position%20of%20the%20Sun.md) in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md). <!--SR:!2024-08-20,37,297!2024-08-27,44,317-->
  - [solar day](../../../../general/synodic%20day.md) ::: About 24 hours for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). Similar to the "day" we are familiar with. The time between two occurrences of the same [position of the Sun](../../../../general/position%20of%20the%20Sun.md) in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md). <!--SR:!2024-09-02,50,317!2024-07-16,14,297-->
- [sidereal time](../../../../general/sidereal%20time.md) ::: Not the "time" we are familiar with. It is based on the positions of the [fixed stars](../../../../general/fixed%20stars.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-18,16,317!2024-09-07,54,317-->
  - sidereal day ::: About 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). Not the "day" we are familiar with. The time it takes for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) to rotate 360° around its own axis. Usually uses the positions of [fixed stars](../../../../general/fixed%20stars.md) as reference. <!--SR:!2024-08-14,31,297!2024-07-19,17,317-->
    - implications of the sidereal day being shorter than solar day for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::: Every (solar) day, stars appear in the same position in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md) almost 3 minutes 56 seconds earlier. <!--SR:!2024-08-18,35,297!2024-07-19,17,317-->
  - [§ comparison to solar time](../../../../general/sidereal%20time.md#comparison%20to%20solar%20time) ::: Solar day and sidereal day lengths are different. For most planets, which are in [prograde motion](../../../../general/retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) (the [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) spins in the same direction as its orbital direction), the solar day is longer than the sidereal day. Consider a planet and a point on the planet initially facing its parent star. Consider after it has spined 360°, corresponding to a sidereal day. In that time, the planet has progressed in the orbit as well, thus the direction of the parent star has also advanced in the spinning direction. So more time is needed for the point to "catch up" so that it faces the parent star again. Thus, a solar day is longer than the sidereal day. Uncommonly, if the motion is retrograde instead, then reverse the above argument to get the conclusion that a solar day is shorter than a sidereal day. <!--SR:!2024-07-16,14,297!2024-08-19,35,297-->
  - [§ sidereal days compared to solar days on other planets](../../../../general/sidereal%20time.md#sidereal%20days%20compared%20to%20solar%20days%20on%20other%20planets) ::: For [prograde motion](../../../../general/retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) (the [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) spins in the same direction as its orbital direction, which is true for most planets), the formula is $$\text{number of solar days per orbital period} = \text{number of sidereal days per orbital period} - 1$$. For retrograde motion, the formula is $$\text{number of solar days per orbital period} = \text{number of sidereal days per orbital period} + 1$$. The length formulas can easily be derived from above. <!--SR:!2024-08-28,45,317!2024-08-26,43,317-->
- [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md)
  - [axial parallelism](../../../../general/axial%20parallelism.md) ::: Ignoring [axial precession](../../../../general/axial%20precession.md) (which are long-term minor variations in the [rotation axis](../../../../general/rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md)), [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s [rotation axis](../../../../general/rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md) remains fixed. That is, the [North Pole](../../../../general/North%20Pole.md) always point to the [Polaris](../../../../general/Polaris.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-21,18,321!2024-07-19,16,320-->
  - [§ seasons](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md#seasons)
- [season](../../../../general/season.md)
  - [§ axial parallelism](../../../../general/season.md#axial%20parallelism)
  - [§ axial tilt](../../../../general/season.md#axial%20tilt)
  - season [§ elliptical Earth orbit](../../../../general/season.md#elliptical%20Earth%20orbit) ::: The [Earth orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md) being elliptical does not affect the seasons much. As the Earth's [orbital distance](../../../../general/semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes.md) varies by about 3%, sunlight received varies by only about 7%. (In fact, the Earth is farther away in the [summer](../../../../general/summer.md) for the [Northern Hemisphere](../../../../general/Northern%20Hemisphere.md).) For the same reason, some parts of the [Earth's surface](geoid.md) being closer or farther (but not angle of the surface) due to [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) also does not contribute much, considering the distance difference—up to only thousands of [kilometers](../../../../general/kilometre.md)—is even smaller. Both effects are overwhelmed by the effect of axial parallelism and axial tilt. <!--SR:!2024-07-31,22,281!2024-07-20,17,321-->
- [surface power density](../../../../general/surface%20power%20density.md) ::: [power](../../../../general/power%20(physics).md) per unit [area](../../../../general/area.md), e.g. [solar irradiance](../../../../general/solar%20irradiance.md) <!--SR:!2024-07-20,17,320!2024-07-19,16,320-->
  - [solar irradiance](../../../../general/solar%20irradiance.md), solar flux ::: The [power](../../../../general/power%20(physics).md) per unit [area](../../../../general/area.md) ([surface power density](../../../../general/surface%20power%20density.md)) received from the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), typically measured in [watts](../../../../general/watt.md) per [square meter](../../../../general/square%20metre.md) (W/m<sup>2</sup>) in [SI units](../../../../general/International%20System%20of%20Units.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-21,18,321!2024-07-18,15,320-->
    - [solar flux](../../../../general/solar%20irradiance.md) & [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) ::: [Axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) makes the [sunlight](../../../../general/sunlight.md) not necessarily hit the surface [perpendicularly](../../../../general/perpendicular.md). When it is not perpendicular, the same amount of sunlight is spread over a larger surface area. This effect can be approximated as: $$\text{solar flux} = \text{solar power} \cdot \cos \theta$$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the [normal](../../../../general/normal%20(geometry).md) of the surface and the direction of solar radiation. <!--SR:!2024-07-22,19,320!2024-07-22,19,320-->
- [analemma](../../../../general/analemma.md)
  - [analemma](../../../../general/analemma.md) & [season](../../../../general/season.md) ::: The [analemma](../../../../general/analemma.md) at [noon](../../../../general/noon.md) shows the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)'s altitude on the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) at noon in any particular day of the year. Higher altitude means the [sunlight](../../../../general/sunlight.md) is more direct, so it is [summer](../../../../general/summer.md). Conversely, lower altitude means the sunlight is less direct, so it is [winter](../../../../general/winter.md). <!--SR:!2024-08-04,24,280!2024-07-19,16,320-->
  - analemma direction ::: The Sun moves eastward on the analemma near the solstices (the top and bottom of the 8 figure). <!--SR:!2024-07-27,20,337!2024-07-22,15,335-->

  - equinox names ::: spring/vernal equinox, fall/autumnal equinox, March equinox, September equinox <!--SR:!2024-07-23,16,335!2024-07-25,18,337-->
    - spring/vernal equinox, fall/autumnal equinox vs. [March equinox](../../../../general/March%20equinox.md), [September equinox](../../../../general/September%20equinox.md) ::: The former depends on the hemisphere while the latter does not. For the Northern hemisphere, spring/vernal equinox is March equinox and fall/autumnal equinox is September equinox. This is reversed for the Southern hemisphere. <!--SR:!2024-07-26,19,337!2024-07-26,19,337-->
  - March equinox date ::: March 21/22@UT+08 (19–21@UT) <!--SR:!2024-07-19,12,315!2024-08-16,32,315-->

- [solstice](../../../../general/solstice.md) ::: Axis tilt is at the largest angle with regards to the Sun. The Sun is farthest away from the celestial equator on the celestial sphere. One hemisphere receives more sunlight than the other. <!--SR:!2024-07-25,18,335!2024-07-23,16,337-->
  - solstice etymology ::: sol "sun" + stice "stopped", "stationary" <!--SR:!2024-07-26,19,337!2024-07-26,19,335-->
  - solstice names ::: summer solstice, winter solstice, June solstice, December solstice <!--SR:!2024-07-27,20,337!2024-07-22,15,335-->
    - [summer solstice](../../../../general/summer%20solstice.md), [winter solstice](../../../../winter%20solstice.md) vs. [June solstice](../../../../general/June%20solstice.md), [December solstice](../../../../general/December%20solstice.md) ::: The former depends on the hemisphere while the latter does not. For the Northern hemisphere, summer solstice is June solstice and winter solstice is December solstice. This is reversed for the Southern hemisphere. <!--SR:!2024-07-27,20,337!2024-07-27,20,337-->
  - June solstice date ::: June 21/22@UT+08 (20–22@UT) <!--SR:!2024-07-16,9,295!2024-07-27,20,337-->
  - December solstice date ::: December 21/22@UT+08 (20–22@UT) <!--SR:!2024-07-18,11,317!2024-07-19,12,315-->
- [sun path](../../../../general/sun%20path.md) ::: Identify today's Sun position on the ecliptic. Then draw a circle passing through that position and parallel to the celestial equator. This is the path the Sun (roughly) takes on that day. According to the ecliptic, the Sun position oscillates around the celestial equator _over a year_. Then one can see how the path the Sun takes _over a day_ oscillates over a year. By this, one can also see how altitude of the Sun and daytime length change. <!--SR:!2024-07-20,13,317!2024-07-24,17,335-->
  - sun path at polar regions ::: On some days, the circle over a day does not go below or above the horizon. <!--SR:!2024-07-25,18,337!2024-07-21,14,315-->
  - sun path at tropics ::: The Sun is not at the highest altitude on the celestial sphere for both solstices, unlike locations at temperate latitudes. On the equator, the Sun is at the highest altitude during the equinoxes instead. <!--SR:!2024-07-26,19,337!2024-07-21,14,317-->
- [Tropic of Cancer](../../../../general/Tropic%20of%20Cancer.md) ::: Currently 23°26′10.0″ (or 23.43611°) north of the equator. <!--SR:!2024-07-16,9,297!2024-07-26,19,335-->
  - [Tropic of Cancer § name](../../../../general/Tropic%20of%20Cancer.md#name) ::: It was named after the constellation Cancer during last centuries BCE, as the Sun was there on the June solstice. Due to westward precession of the equinoxes, this is no longer the case. The current constellation is Gemini. <!--SR:!2024-07-23,16,335!2024-07-23,16,335-->
- [Tropic of Capricorn](../../../../general/Tropic%20of%20Capricorn.md) ::: Currently 23°26′10.0″ (or 23.43611°) south of the equator. <!--SR:!2024-08-02,19,295!2024-07-24,17,337-->
  - [Tropic of Capricorn § name](../../../../general/Tropic%20of%20Capricorn.md#name) ::: It was named after the constellation Capricorn during last centuries BCE, as the Sun was there on the December solstice. Due to westward precession of the equinoxes, this is no longer the case. The current constellation is Sagittarius. <!--SR:!2024-07-24,17,335!2024-07-25,18,337-->
- [Arctic Circle](../../../../general/Arctic%20Circle.md) ::: About 66°33′50.0″ north of the equator. The southernmost altitude at which the Sun does not set for at least 24 continuous hours per year. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,12,317!2024-07-25,18,337-->
- [Antarctic Circle](../../../../general/Antarctic%20Circle.md) ::: About 66°33′50.0″ south of the equator. The northernmost altitude at which the Sun does not set for at least 24 continuous hours per year. <!--SR:!2024-07-22,15,317!2024-07-23,16,335-->
- 4 [seasons](season.md) as we know it ::: The 4 seasons as we know it only happen at temperate latitudes. For tropics (latitudes in between the tropics), the seasons become the _dry season_ and the _wet season_, or may not exist at all like in alpines and deserts. For polar regions (latitudes in the Arctic or Antarctic Circle), the sun does not set on some days during the "summer", and does not rise for some days during the "winter". This is apparent when considering the sun path oscillation, restricted to the visible parts of the celestial sphere. <!--SR:!2024-08-08,24,295!2024-07-24,17,337-->
- [axial precession](../../../../general/axial%20precession.md) ::: The orientation of Earth's axis of rotation gradually shifts westward (opposite of the Earth's direction of rotation) in a circle over a period of about 26&nbsp;000 years. <!--SR:!2024-07-26,18,339!2024-07-25,17,339-->
  - axial precession effects ::: One effect is that the celestial poles points at a different direction, changing the pole stars (e.g. the north star will eventually no longer be Polaris). The other is that the constellations the Sun's projection is on during the equinoxes and solstices shifts westward along the zodiac. <!--SR:!2024-07-26,19,337!2024-07-27,20,337-->
- [solar term](../../../../general/solar%20term.md) ::: One of the 24 periods in traditional Chinese lunisolar calendars. <!--SR:!2024-07-24,17,335!2024-07-22,15,335-->

  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / synodic [rotation period](../../../../general/rotation%20period%20(astronomy).md) (with respect to the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)) ::: about 29.5 days = synodic orbital period (due to tidal locking) <!--SR:!2024-07-24,16,339!2024-07-24,16,339-->
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / [tidal locking](../../../../general/tidal%20locking.md) (misnomer: synchronous orbit) ::: The orbital period equals the rotation period. That means the same near side is always exposed to the Earth. The far side is also called the "dark side of the Moon". <!--SR:!2024-07-23,15,319!2024-07-28,20,339-->
  - [lunar phase](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md) ::: Cycles once every lunar month, which is about 29.5 days, which is the same as the synodic rotation period. Caused by changing relative orbital positions of the Moon, Earth, and the Sun, as the Moon orbits around Earth and Earth orbits around the Sun. Half of the Moon is always sunlit (the side facing the Sun), but as the visible side (the side facing the Earth) shifts relative to the sunlit side, so the portion of visible side that is sunlit changes. <!--SR:!2024-07-17,10,319!2024-07-18,11,319-->
    - [lunar phase § principal and intermediate phases of the Moon](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md#principal%20and%20intermediate%20phases%20of%20the%20Moon) ::: new moon -> waxing crescent -> first quarter -> waxing gibbous -> full moon -> waning gibbous -> third quarter -> waning crescent -> (new moon) <!--SR:!2024-07-23,15,319!2024-07-27,19,339-->
      - [lunar phase § principal and intermediate phases of the Moon](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md#principal%20and%20intermediate%20phases%20of%20the%20Moon) / memorization ::: New moon and full moon are easily remembered. Then insert the 2 quarters, first quarter and third quarter, respectively in between new moon and full moon, and in between full moon and next new moon. Finally, in between each of the 4 phases, including between third quarter and next new moon, insert the 4 minor phases. The 4 minor phases is a word combination of waxing or waning, and crescent or gibbous. Waxing means "increasing" while waning means "decreasing". Crescent means "sickle moon" while gibbous means "convex" or "protuberant", so the former is thinner than the latter. <!--SR:!2024-07-23,15,319!2024-07-17,10,319-->
    - [lunar phase](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md) / moonrise and moonset ::: Each day, the Moon advances in its orbit slightly, delaying moonrise and moonset daily by about 50 minutes. The moonrise and moonset times correspond to the moon phases, and resets every lunar month. <!--SR:!2024-07-21,14,319!2024-07-26,18,339-->
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / sidereal [orbital period](../../../../general/orbital%20period.md) ::: about 27.3 days <!--SR:!2024-07-25,17,339!2024-07-25,17,339-->

- [orbital period § synodic period](../../../../general/orbital%20period.md#synodic%20period) ::: It is the orbital period of a body orbiting a second body, using a third body as the reference. (The second body and the third body can be the same.) It is also the time between [conjunctions](conjunction%20(astronomy).md) of the second body and the third body as viewed from the first body. For observers on [Earth](Earth.md), the usual reference (third body) is the [Sun](Sun.md). <!--SR:!2024-08-04,21,299!2024-07-28,20,339-->
  - [orbital period § synodic period](../../../../general/orbital%20period.md#synodic%20period) / calculation ::: For 2 bodies orbiting in the same direction, $$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} - \frac 1 {T_2} \qquad T_1 < T_2$$. For 2 bodies orbiting in opposing direction, $$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} + \frac 1 {T_2}$$. <!--SR:!2024-07-27,19,339!2024-07-24,16,339-->

  - [§ from Earth](../../../../general/apparent%20retrograde%20motion.md#from%20Earth)
  - explaining apparent retrograde motion ::: The inner planet moves faster than the outer planet when they are near conjunctions, so the relative velocity reverses and apparent retrograde motion occurs. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,11,320!2024-07-27,18,340-->
    - explaining apparent retrograde motion in ancient times ::: As most ancients thought that Earth is the center, it was harder to explain. Their explanation was using deferents and epicycles. <!--SR:!2024-07-25,16,340!2024-07-27,18,340-->
- [stellar parallax](../../../../general/stellar%20parallax.md)
- reason the (very) ancient Greeks thought Earth is the center ::: They cannot observe stellar parallax of the fixed stars. There were 2 plausible explanations for them. One was the fixed stars are too far away so the stellar parallax is too small to be observed with the naked eye. The other was Earth is the center of the universe. With rare exceptions, the first (and correct) option was rejected by most (very) ancient Greeks because they could not believe that fixed stars are _that_ far away. <!--SR:!2024-07-21,12,320!2024-07-25,16,340-->
  - reason the (very) ancient Greeks thought Earth is the center / exceptions ::: (very) ancient Greeks who thought the fixed stars are indeed _that_ far away: Aristarchus, etc. <!--SR:!2024-07-29,20,340!2024-07-21,12,320-->

      - Plato (428–348 BC) thinking ::: Earth at the center of the universe; all natural motions are perfectly circular; all celestial objects are perfect spheres <!--SR:!2024-07-23,14,320!2024-07-16,8,300-->

  - [§ Ptolemaic system](../../../../general/geocentric%20model.md#Ptolemaic%20system)
  - Why had the geocentric model persisted for about 1500 years? ::: It was the best model until the appearance of the heliocentric model described by Kepler in 1624. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,3,312!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - How was the geocentric model challenged? ::: Aristarchus of Samos had the idea a very long time ago, but it was the ancient Greek times. The actual challenge started with Nicolaus Copernicus also having the idea. Then Tycho Brahe collected astronomical data. Finally, the data was interpreted by Johannes Kepler and developed his 3 laws of planetary motion to explain the data. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,332-->
- [Copernican heliocentrism](../../../../general/Copernican%20heliocentrism.md)
  - [§ Copernican theory](../../../../general/Copernican%20heliocentrism.md#Copernican%20theory)
  - Why do we not need the motion of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) even if it is moving quickly? ::: Because we feel acceleration, not motion. It turns out Earth's acceleration (about 0.0059 m/s<sup>2</sup>) is too little to notice. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- [Tycho Brahe](../../../../general/Tycho%20Brahe.md) ::: A Danish astronomer known for his comprehensive and unprecedentedly accurate astronomical observations (With the naked eye! Telescopes were not invented yet.). His observations, particularly Mars, disagreed with predictions of the existing perfect heliocentric model. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,3,312!2024-07-19,4,332-->
- [Johannes Kepler](../../../../general/Johannes%20Kepler.md) ::: He did not ignore small discrepancies between the data and predictions of existing models, and finally came up with elliptical orbits. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-18,3,314-->
- [ellipse](../../../../general/ellipse.md)
- [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](../../../../general/Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md)
  - 2nd Kepler's law implications ::: Planets travel faster when they are closer to the Sun. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,332-->
  - [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](../../../../general/Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) / the physics behind ::: The physics behind is [Newton's laws of motion](Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md), proposed about 60 years later. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,332-->

- [Galileo Galilei](../../../../general/Galileo%20Galilei.md) ::: He overcame 3 key objections rooted in the Aristotelian view: Earth could not be moving as objects would be left behind, non-circular orbits are not "perfect" as the heavens should be, and stellar parallax should have been detected. He also provided 2 key observations using the newly invented telescope. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - countering "Earth could not be moving as objects would be left behind" ::: Aristotle's belief that all objects naturally come to rest is wrong. Moving objects stay in motion unless an external force acts to slow them down (Newton's laws of motion). Further, we do not feel motion, just as we do not feel a ship is moving or a rest when sitting inside a cabin, so that there are no visual clues that tells us the conditions of the ship (equivalence principle). <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - countering "non-circular orbits are not 'perfect' as the heavens should be" ::: Tycho's observations of comets and sueprnovas demonstrated the heavens are imperfect. Galileo also observed sunspots on the Sun (the Sun is imperfect), and mountains and valleys on the Moon (the Moon is not a perfect sphere). <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - countering "stellar parallax should have been detected" ::: Tycho thought his naked-eye observations should detect stellar parallax for distances he thought the stars were located at. Galileo showed that the stars are even farther away than Tycho thought, so not detecting stellar parallax is okay. He observed that the Milky Way has many stars using his telescope, partially demonstrating the stars' extreme distances. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [Galilean Moons](../../../../general/Galilean%20Moons.md) ::: They are the four largest moons of Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Galileo observed the moons and reasoned that the Moon can orbit Earth instead of the Sun, just as there are moons orbiting Jupiter. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,332-->
  - [phases of Venus](../../../../general/phases%20of%20Venus.md) ::: They are the variations of lighting seen on the planet's surface, similar to lunar phases. Galileo observed a full set of phases. However, according to the Ptolemaic model, Venus can only show a crescent phase as Venus is always in between Earth and the Sun. This is better explained by a heilocentric model. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-18,3,314-->
  - angular size of Venus ::: The change in angular size of Venus (about 10 to 58 arcseconds) is too extreme to be explained by the Ptolemaic model but easily explained by a heliocentric model. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,3,314!2024-07-18,3,314-->
- [speed](../../../../general/speed.md) ::: rate at which the object moves, without considering direction, usually in m/s <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,332!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- [velocity](../../../../general/velocity.md) ::: magnitude (speed) and direction at which the objects move, usually in m/s and labelled a direction (e.g. east) <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,332!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- [acceleration](../../../../general/acceleration.md) ::: rate of change of magnitude and direction in velocity, usually in m/s<sup>2</sup> and labelled a direction (e.g. east) <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [gravity of Earth](../../../../general/gravity%20of%20Earth.md) ::: An example of acceleration. All falling objects, regardless of their masses, on Earth accelerate at $g = 9.8\text{ m/s}^2 \approx 10\text{ m/s}^2$; that is, the speed increases by $g$ per second of falling. Note that this neglects the effect of air resistance. (See the demonstration of a feather and hammer falling on the Moon during the Apollo 15 mission, which has no atmospheres.) <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- [classical element](../../../../general/classical%20element.md)
  - [§ Aristotle](../../../../general/classical%20element.md#Aristotle) ::: 5 elements: earth, water, air, fire, quintessence (heavenly element) <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
    - [classical element § Aristotle](../../../../general/classical%20element.md#Aristotle) / classical element properties ::: Earth is _naturally_ the center of the universe. Then other elements, in the order of (earth, then) water, air, and fire, _naturally_ surrounds it in multiple layers of circles. Heavenly element is not surrounded by a circle, as it is the outermost element. The first 4 elements are earthy elements, which returns to their _natural_ positions _naturally_. Quintessence performs perpetual circular motion. That means earthly objects would _naturally_ come to rest without any force applied. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,3,314!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [classical element § Aristotle](../../../../general/classical%20element.md#Aristotle) / motion properties ::: There exists a natural state of "no motion", being at rest. At rest is special because all earthy elements eventually come to rest. Thus, at rest and moving can be distinguished. People should be able to notice whether they are at rest or moving. Particularly, Earth is at rest in the geocentric model. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [§ aether](../../../../general/classical%20element.md#aether)
- [Galilean invariance](../../../../general/Galilean%20invariance.md) ::: The laws of motion are the same in all inertial frames of reference. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [inertial frame of reference](../../../../general/inertial%20frame%20of%20reference.md) ::: The view of other objects of an observer that is not undergoing acceleration. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
    - Why do we feel acceleration but not uniform motion? ::: If we can feel uniform motion, that means we can distinguish undergoing uniform motion versus being at rest. Yet both frames of references are inertial as there is no acceleration, which by Galilean invariance, should not be distinguishable. So we cannot feel uniform motion. But acceleration can be felt as the frame of reference is no longer inertial. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,3,314!2024-07-19,4,332-->
  - [Galileo's ship § 1632 thought experiment](../../../../general/Galileo's%20ship.md#1632%20thought%20experiment) ::: In short: You are in a cabin of a ship, without any windows (cannot look at the outside world). There are many things going on in the cabin. Imagine two scenarios: the ship is not moving, and the ship is moving in uniform motion (no acceleration). In both scenarios, you observe things going on in the cabin. You would see everything goes on the same way whether the ship is moving or not. Therefore, there is no way to distinguish between uniform motion or being at rest without looking outside. Being in uniform motion is undetectable. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-18,3,314-->
- [friction](../../../../general/friction.md)
  - Why do things come to rest spontaneously in our everyday lives? ::: It is due to friction. It is the force resisting relative lateral motion of contact surfaces of two objects. The origin of friction is the microscopic interactions of particles between the two surfaces. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - How to make things move longer? ::: If friction is reduced, objects can move for a longer time, such as using an air cushion. If it is eliminated, objects can move forever, but we do not have perfectly frictionless surface in our everyday lives. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [friction](../../../../general/friction.md) / Galileo's thought experiment ::: Assume there is a ball moving on a perfectly frictionless track. Say the track goes down and then up. The ball will go up to the original height if the track goes back up high enough. If the track does not go back high enough, then it will roll forever. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->

- [Issac Newton](../../../../general/Issac%20Newton.md) (1642–1727) ::: He is famous for his three laws of motions, law of universal gravitation, invention of calculus, optics, reflecting telescopes, etc. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-18,3,312-->
  - Newton's laws of motion + law of universal gravitation ::: They can account for (almost; see Einstein's theories) everything about astronomical-scale objects. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,332-->
- [Newton's laws of motion](../../../../general/Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md)
  - [Newton's laws of motion § first law](../../../../general/Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md#first%20law) ::: An object either remains at rest or in motion at constant velocity unless a net force acts on it to change its speed and/or direction of motion. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,332-->
    - [Newton's laws of motion § first law](../../../../general/Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md#first%20law) / examples ::: Free falling is experienced for a spacecraft and its content orbiting Earth. In that situation, the first law can be easily observed. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,3,314!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [Newton's laws of motion § second law](../../../../general/Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md#second%20law) ::: force = mass * acceleration: $$\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$$ <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [Newton's laws of motion § third law](../../../../general/Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md#third%20law) ::: For every force acting on B by A, there is always an equal and opposite reaction force acting on A by B. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,332-->
    - [Newton's laws of motion § third law](../../../../general/Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md#third%20law) / examples ::: When launching a rocket, the rocket pushes (ejects) a large amount of mass downward, so the large amount of mass pushes the rocket upward by the third law. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - How has Newton's laws of motion changed our view of the universe? ::: He realized that physical laws are the same regardless if they happen on Earth or in space. Before Newton, orbital mechanics (Kepler's laws of planetary motion) and terrestrial mechanics (constant acceleration towards Earth, principle of inertia) seemed to be two separate mechanics. After Newton, we realized they are actually based on the same laws of physics. An example is circular orbit. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- [circular orbit](../../../../general/circular%20orbit.md)
  - [§ circular acceleration](../../../../general/circular%20orbit.md#circular%20acceleration) ::: centripetal acceleration: objects in circular motion are accelerating towards the center of the circle <!--SR:!2024-07-18,3,312!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [§ velocity](../../../../general/circular%20orbit.md#velocity)
  - Why do we not talk about elliptic orbits here? ::: Because mathematically describing the orbit is too mathematically involved for a common core course. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- [Newton's law of universal gravitation](../../../../general/Newton's%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation.md)
  - [Newton's law of universal gravitation](../../../../general/Newton's%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation.md) / mathematical statement ::: $$F = \frac {GMm} {r^2}$$, where $M$ and $m$ are masses of two objects, with $r$ being the distance between their centers of mass. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [Newton's law of universal gravitation](../../../../general/Newton's%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation.md) / proportionality ::: The gravitational force is proportional to both masses of two objects, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers of mass. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,3,314!2024-07-19,4,332-->
  - [Newton's law of universal gravitation](../../../../general/Newton's%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation.md)
- [unification of theories in physics § unification of gravity and astronomy](../../../../general/unification%20of%20theories%20in%20physics.md)
  - [unification of theories in physics § unification of gravity and astronomy](../../../../general/unification%20of%20theories%20in%20physics.md) / examples ::: Take circular orbits. It turns out celestial objects perform circular orbits due to gravitational force, the same force responsible for making everyday things fall down to the ground. In fact, we can equate the equations to solve for the centripetal acceleration $a$: $$a = F / m = GMm / {mr^2} = GM / r^2 = g$$, which is the same as the [gravitational acceleration](../../../../general/gravitational%20acceleration.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- [Kepler orbit](../../../../general/Kepler%20orbit.md) ::: In increasing energy: circle, ellipsis, parabola, hyperbola. The former two are bounded, meaning orbiting objects return to the same position periodically. The latter two are unbounded, meaning the object does not return, and has nonnegative velocity at infinitely far away. Parabola is the boundary between bounded and unbounded orbits, where the object has exactly zero velocity at infinitely far away, and always equals the escape velocity at every point of its trajectory. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](../../../../general/Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) / third law
  - [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](../../../../general/Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) / third law / mathematical statement ::: $$T^2 = \frac {4\pi^2} {G(M + m)} a^3$$, where $T$ is the orbital period, $a$ is the semi-major axis, $M$ and $m$ are the two objects, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](../../../../general/Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) / third law / derivation for a special case ::: In the special case of a circular orbit ($a = r$) and the mass of the orbiting object $m$ is negligible ($m \ll M$): $$\frac {GMm} {r^2} = m \omega^2 r \implies GM = \omega^2 r^3 \implies GM = r^3 \left(\frac {2\pi} T \right)^2 \implies GM T^2 = 4\pi^2 r^3 \implies T^2 = \frac {4\pi^2} {GM} r^3$$ <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](../../../../general/Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) / third law / applications ::: Finding the mass of the primary body from the orbital period and semi-major axis of the orbiting body, assuming the primary body is much more massive than the orbiting body. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- [mass](../../../../general/mass.md) ::: There are multiple definitions, different conceptually but physically equivalent. Traditionally, it was believed to be the quantity of matter. The SI unit is kg. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,332!2024-07-19,4,332-->
- [weight](../../../../general/weight.md) ::: It is simply the force acting on the object due to acceleration of gravity. Nothing in the definition relates to mass or quantity of matter. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-18,3,312-->
- [apparent weight](../../../../general/apparent%20weight.md) ::: It is how heavy an object _appears_ to be. Most of the time, this is the ground reaction force. When one is stationary, then the force of gravity are balanced by the ground reaction force, so apparent weight equals weight. However, they are different whenever the force of gravity is not balanced by the reaction force, such as in an accelerating lift, or free falling. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,332!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [apparent weight](../../../../general/apparent%20weight.md) / [weightlessness](../../../../general/weightlessness.md) examples ::: This also means a "weightless" astronaut in low Earth orbit has an apparent weight of zero (the astronaut is free falling), but has almost the same weight as he would have while standing on the ground. Another daily life example is an accelerating lift. The lift accelerating upwards makes you feel heavier, and vice versa. If the lift accelerates downward at the same rate as the gravitational acceleration, then you are free falling and would feel "weightless", like the astronaut example just now. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- [momentum](../../../../general/momentum.md) ::: $$\mathbf p = m \mathbf v$$, where $\mathbf p$ is the momentum, $m$ is the mass, and $v$ is the velocity. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,332!2024-07-19,4,332-->
  - momentum & force ::: For an object of fixed mass $m$, net force is also the change in momentum with respect to time: $$\frac {\mathrm d \mathbf p} {\mathrm dt} = m \frac {\mathrm d \mathbf v} {\mathrm dt} = m \mathbf a = \mathbf F$$. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,332-->
  - [momentum § conservation](../../../../general/momentum.md#conservation) ::: In a closed system (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces), the total momentum (by summing up the momentum of each object over all objects) remains constant. No matter how complex the interactions internal to the closed system are, this law holds. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [momentum](../../../../general/momentum.md) / rotational analog ::: Its rotation analog is [angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md), which is also [conserved](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md#conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum) in a closed system. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- [angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md) ::: $$\mathbf L = \mathbf r \times \mathbf p = m \cdot \mathbf r \times \mathbf v$$, where $\mathbf L$ is the angular momentum, $\mathbf r$ is the position vector, $\mathbf p$ is the momentum, $m$ is the mass, $\mathbf v$ is the velocity. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,332-->
  - [angular momentum § conservation of angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md#conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum) ::: In a closed system (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces), letting a position as the origin, the total angular momentum (by summing up the angular momentum of each object over all objects) remains constant. No matter how complex the interactions internal to the closed system are, this law holds. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,3,314!2024-07-19,4,332-->
    - [angular momentum § conservation of angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md#conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum) / examples ::: Like how force is the change in linear momentum, torque (twisting force) is the change in angular momentum. A force perpendicular to the line joining the center and the object produces torque, whereas one parallel does not. In a circular or elliptical orbit, with the primary body as center, as the gravitational force always point to the center, so it is always parallel to the line joining the center and the object. No torque is produced, and thus the angular momentum is conserved. Intuitively, the increase or decrease in orbital velocity is counteracted by the decrease or increase in the distance to the primary body, conserving angular momentum. Another example is that ice-skaters spin faster when they retract their hands, which works by the same intuition. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,332!2024-07-19,4,332-->
- [energy](../../../../general/energy.md) ::: The quantitative property transferred to a body or system, recognizable as work, heat, light, etc. Its SI units is joules (J). Energy is also conserved. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,3,312!2024-07-19,4,332-->
  - [conservation of energy](../../../../general/conservation%20of%20energy.md) ::: The total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time. But energy can be transferred from one object to another object, both in the isolated system. It can also change in form. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,332!2024-07-19,4,334-->
  - [energy § forms](../../../../general/energy.md#forms) / examples ::: kinetic: energy of motion; potential: stored energy, chemically, gravitationally, etc.; radiative: energy of light <!--SR:!2024-07-18,3,314!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- [thermal energy](../../../../general/thermal%20energy.md) ::: A measure of total kinetic and potential energy of all particles in a substance. Therefore, it depends on both the temperature, the measure of average kinetic energy, and density of the substance. That means something having a higher temperature than the other thing does not imply its thermal energy is higher. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,332-->
  - [temperature](../../../../general/temperature.md) ::: A physical quantity describing hotness and coldness. Elementarily, temperature can be thought of as the average kinetic energy of particles. Its units are usually degree Celsius (°C) and and Kelvin (K). Kelvin is often used in physics as temperature in said unit is proportional to the average kinetic energy. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
    - [temperature](../../../../general/temperature.md) / [conversion](../../../../general/conversion%20of%20scales%20of%20temperature.md) between [Celsius](../../../../general/Celsius.md) and [Kelvin](../../../../general/Kelvin.md) ::: from Celsius to Kelvin: x °C ≘ (x + 273.15) K, from Kelvin to Celsius: x K ≘ (x − 273.15) °C <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,332!2024-07-19,4,332-->
- [gravitational energy](../../../../general/gravitational%20energy.md)
  - [gravitational energy § formulation](../../../../general/gravitational%20energy.md#formulation) ::: Close to Earth's surface, the gravitational energy is: $$U = mgh$$, where $U$ is the gravitational energy, $m$ is the mass, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $h$ is how fall an object could potentially fall. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- energy transformation of a contracting gas cloud ::: A contracting gas cloud (e.g. star formation) converts gravitational energy to thermal energy. Since the gas cloud can be very big, so the cloud can originally have huge amounts of gravitational energy, which when converted to thermal energy, makes the cloud very hot. This is one of the mechanisms responsible for star formation. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,334!2024-07-19,4,334-->
- [mass–energy equivalence](../../../../general/mass–energy%20equivalence.md)
  - [mass–energy equivalence](../../../../general/mass–energy%20equivalence.md) / implications ::: A small amount of mass can release huge amounts of energy (e.g. nuclear bombs, nuclear reactors). Concentrated energy can also turn into mass (e.g. particle accelerators). <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,332!2024-07-19,4,332-->
