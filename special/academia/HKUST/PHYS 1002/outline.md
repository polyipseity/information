      - radiation zone radiation detection ::: The radiation from the radiation zone can be detected and analyzed via [astronomical spectroscopy](../../../../astronomical%20spectroscopy.md). This produces a spectrum, which is _mostly_ similar to a [black body](../../../../general/black%20body.md), but the _small_ differences are significant and tell us about many properties of the [star](../../../../general/star.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-15,15,290!2024-07-14,14,290-->

  - [comet](../../../../general/comet.md) ::: A relatively small and _icy_ object that orbits a [star](../../../../general/star.md). The heat from the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) melts the ice to form the tail when the comet is close. <!--SR:!2024-07-16,16,290!2024-07-14,14,290-->
    - asteroid vs. comet ::: The basic difference is its composition: rocky vs. icy. <!--SR:!2024-07-14,14,290!2024-07-13,13,290-->
  - [natural satellite](../../../../general/natural%20satellite.md) or moon ::: An object that orbits a [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) or [dwarf planet](../../../../general/dwarf%20planet.md). (Man-made objects are simply called _satellites_.) <!--SR:!2024-07-11,11,270!2024-07-14,14,290-->

    - supercluster examples ::: [Local Supercluster](../../../../general/Virgo%20Supercluster.md) <!--SR:!2024-07-10,10,270!2024-07-13,13,290-->
  - [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) ::: The totality of everything that exists, including space, time, matter, and energy. <!--SR:!2024-07-16,16,290!2024-07-13,13,290-->
- [mass–energy equivalence](../../../../general/mass–energy%20equivalence.md) ::: $E = mc^2$: mass and energy are equivalent (differ only by a multiplicative constant and the units of measurement) <!--SR:!2024-07-14,14,290!2024-07-10,10,270-->
- brief history of the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) ::: [Big Bang](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md) (13.8 billion years ago) -> galaxy formation -> star evolution (cycle: formation -> fuel consumption -> death) -> Earth <!--SR:!2024-07-14,14,290!2024-07-14,14,290-->
  - How to know what [Hong Kong](../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md) was like in the past? ::: Look at historic photos of [Hong Kong](../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-13,13,290!2024-07-13,13,290-->

- [speed of light](../../../../general/speed%20of%20light.md) ::: exactly 299&nbsp;792&nbsp;458 m/s _in vacuum_, often approximated as 300&nbsp;000 km/s; 8 times around the Earth in 1 second <!--SR:!2024-07-15,15,290!2024-07-15,15,290-->
  - light travel time from Earth to... ::: the Moon: ~1.3 second, the Sun: ~8 minutes, Sirius (brightest star in the night sky): ~8 years, Andromeda Galaxy (nearest major galaxy): ~2.5 million years <!--SR:!2024-07-09,9,270!2024-07-13,13,290-->
  - speed of light implications ::: We see astronomical objects as they were in the past since they are so far away. The further the object is in distance, the further back we look back into time. <!--SR:!2024-07-14,14,290!2024-07-13,13,290-->
- [lookback time](../../../../general/cosmic%20time.md#lookback%20time)
- [light-year](../../../../general/light-year.md) ::: the distance light travels in one year; exactly 9460&nbsp;730&nbsp;472&nbsp;580&nbsp;800 m, approximately 9.4607 × 10<sup>15</sup> m <!--SR:!2024-07-11,4,190!2024-07-14,14,290-->
  - light-year unofficial variation ::: We use 365 days in a year instead of 365.25 to calculate 1 light-year in the PowerPoint. But 365.25 should be acceptable either way... <!--SR:!2024-07-16,16,290!2024-07-16,16,290-->
- [observable universe](../../../../general/observable%20universe.md) ::: It has a radius (in [comoving distance](../../../../general/comoving%20and%20proper%20distances.md)) of 46.5 billion light-years instead of 13.8 billion light-years due to expansion of the universe. <!--SR:!2024-07-13,13,290!2024-07-11,11,270-->
  - Can we see the entire [universe](../../../../general/universe.md)? ::: No. Estimates suggest that the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) is at least 250 times larger (in volume) than a [Hubble sphere](../../../../general/Hubble%20volume.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-15,15,290!2024-07-13,13,290-->
- [scale of the universe @ HKUST](scale%20of%20the%20universe%20@%20HKUST.md) ::: a 1:10<sup>10</sup> (length) model <!--SR:!2024-07-17,17,308!2024-07-18,18,308-->

## week 1 lecture 2

- time: 2024-06-20T10:00:00+08:00/2024-06-20T12:30:00+08:00
- [Cosmic Calendar](../../../../general/Cosmic%20Calendar.md) ::: Compress the entire history of the universe till now (13.8 billion years) into 1 year. 1 month ≈ 1.2 billion yrs, 1 day ≈ 40 million yrs, 1 sec ≈ 440 yrs <!--SR:!2024-07-30,22,268!2024-07-15,15,308-->
  - Cosmic Calendar highlights ::: The [Solar System](../../../../general/Solar%20System.md) formed on September. Dinosaurs appeared on Christmas (25 Dec) and extincted yesterday (30 Dec). All of recorded human history occurred in the last 30 seconds. We (age of ~20) were born 0.05 seconds before. <!--SR:!2024-07-11,12,288!2024-07-18,18,308-->
- Are we ever standing still? ::: No! Consider the movement of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md), the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), and [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-14,14,308!2024-07-17,17,308-->
- movement of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::: [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md), [Earth's orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md), movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) <!--SR:!2024-07-10,10,288!2024-07-16,16,308-->
  - [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md) ::: [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) rotates on its axis once very day (~24 h). Its [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) is about 23.5°, pointing to [Polaris](../../../../general/Polaris.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-11,11,288!2024-07-18,18,308-->
  - [Earth's orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md) ::: [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) orbits the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) once a year at an average distance of 1 [AU](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md), in counterclockwise direction as viewed from above. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-16,16,308-->
    - [astronomical unit](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md) ::: 1 [AU](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md) = 149&nbsp;597&nbsp;870&nbsp;700 m ≈ 150 million km <!--SR:!2024-07-11,7,228!2024-07-17,17,308-->
    - Earth's orbital speed ::: surprisingly quick, 29.78 km/s or 107&nbsp;200 km/h <!--SR:!2024-07-19,12,248!2024-07-17,17,308-->
  - Why do we not feel the movement of Earth even if it is moving very quickly? ::: Although Earth moves very quickly, its acceleration is very little. As we feel acceleration but not velocity, we do not feel the Earth moving. (Imagine riding on trains which are respectively accelerating, in constant velocity, and decelerating.) For [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md), consider that the [angular velocity](../../../../general/angular%20velocity.md) is very small. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-18,18,308-->
  - [angular velocity](../../../../general/angular%20velocity.md) ::: Angular velocity is $\omega = \frac {v_{\perp} } r$, where $v_{\perp}$ is the signed (+: counterclockwise, -: clockwise) magnitude of the tangential velocity and $r$ is the radius from the rotation center. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-17,17,308-->
- movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) ::: [solar apex](../../../../general/solar%20apex.md), [orbit of the Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md#motion), movement of the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-16,16,308-->
  - [solar apex § direction](../../../../general/solar%20apex.md#direction) ::: The [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) moves relative to the local solar neighborhood ([local standard of rest](../../../../general/local%20standard%20of%20rest.md)) at about 72&nbsp;000 km/h. (Actually, this was the measured speed before 1986, but we will use it here anyway.) <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-10,10,288-->
  - [orbit of the Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md#motion) ::: The [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) orbits around the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) center about every 230 million years at a speed of about 800&nbsp;000 km/h. <!--SR:!2024-07-11,11,288!2024-07-15,15,308-->
  - Why do we not notice the movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) even if it is moving extremely quickly? ::: This is because the distance between [stars](../../../../general/star.md) is even larger. In a 1:10<sup>10</sup> model, the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)'s speed 70&nbsp;000 km/h is 0.7 cm/h. Compare this to the scaled distance of 4400 km (4.4 ly) between the Sun and [Alpha Centauri](../../../../general/Alpha%20Centauri.md). One implication is that stars appear to be stationary over lifetimes of many generations, allowing the concept of [constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-16,16,308!2024-07-18,18,308-->
- [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) fun fact ::: While most of the light come from the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md)'s bulge and disk, most of its mass is in its halo. ([dark matter](../../../../general/dark%20matter.md)) <!--SR:!2024-07-14,14,308!2024-07-16,16,308-->
- movement of the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) ::: [approaching the Andromeda Galaxy](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md#intergalactic%20neighborhood), [Hubble's law](../../../../general/Hubble's%20law.md) <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-18,18,308-->
  - [approaching the Andromeda Galaxy](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md#intergalactic%20neighborhood) ::: at about 300&nbsp;000 km/h <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-18,18,308-->
  - [Hubble's law](../../../../general/Hubble's%20law.md) ::: Attributed to [Edwin Hubble](../../../../general/Edwin%20Hubble.md). All [galaxies](../../../../general/galaxy.md) outside our [Local Group](../../../../general/Local%20Group.md) are moving away from us, with the speeds proportional to their distances. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,18,308!2024-07-16,16,308-->
    - Hubble's law implications ::: An evidence for the [expansion of the universe](../../../../general/expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md). Consider [raisins](../../../../general/raisin.md) (galaxies) in a rising loaf of bread (the universe). Raisins further apart from each other move away from each other faster. <!--SR:!2024-07-16,16,308!2024-07-17,17,308-->
- recurring patterns on [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::: day: circling sky, month: phases of the [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md), year: 4 seasons <!--SR:!2024-07-16,14,313!2024-07-13,11,293-->
- How does the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) look like from [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) using the naked eye? ::: We can see more than 2000 [stars](../../../../general/star.md) as well as the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md). (Unfortunately, due to light pollution, many [stars](../../../../general/star.md) cannot be seen from [Hong Kong](../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md).) <!--SR:!2024-07-12,10,293!2024-07-15,13,293-->
- [constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md) ::: A region of the sky. There are 88 of them. Most names come from the imagination of ancient people. They are now used as landmarks by modern [astronomers](../../../../general/astronomer.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-14,12,293!2024-07-18,16,313-->
- [asterism](../../../../general/asterism%20(astronomy).md) ::: An observed pattern of [stars](../../../../general/star.md) in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md). More general than [constellations](../../../../general/constellation.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-15,13,293!2024-07-09,9,293-->
  - asterism examples ::: the [Big Dipper](../../../../general/Big%20Dipper.md), [Ursa Major](../../../../general/Ursa%20Major.md) ([constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md)) <!--SR:!2024-07-18,16,313!2024-07-17,15,313-->
  - the [Big Dipper](../../../../general/Big%20Dipper.md) ::: It consists of the 7 brightest stars of the constellation [Ursa Major](../../../../general/Ursa%20Major.md). (Also known as BeiDou (Chinese: 北斗). The [BeiDou](../../../../general/BeiDou.md) Navigation Satellite System (BDS) is named after it.) <!--SR:!2024-07-19,17,313!2024-07-13,11,293-->
- Are stars in an asterism or constellation of the same cluster and similar distance? ::: No! They can very far apart from each other, like many light-years away. <!--SR:!2024-07-20,18,313!2024-07-18,16,313-->
- motion of the [stars](../../../../general/star.md) ::: They go around us once per day, like how the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) rises and sets. <!--SR:!2024-07-20,18,313!2024-07-16,14,293-->
- [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) (Chinese: 天球) ::: An imaginary sphere with [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) as the center. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,17,313!2024-07-17,15,313-->
  - Why do stars appear to be fixed on the celestial sphere? And what are the exceptions? ::: Even if the stars (Chinese: 恆星 for 'unmoving star') are moving very quickly (described in km), their distances to us are even higher (described in ly), so they _appear_ fixed. The [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md), the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), and [planets](../../../../general/planet.md) (Chinese: 行星 for 'moving star') are much closer and moves slowly on the sphere. <!--SR:!2024-07-12,10,293!2024-07-16,14,313-->
  - horizon ::: plane tangent to the ground, depends on your location <!--SR:!2024-07-15,13,293!2024-07-14,12,293-->
  - [zenith](../../../../general/zenith.md) ::: point on the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) directly overhead, depends on your location <!--SR:!2024-07-20,18,313!2024-07-20,18,313-->

  - south [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md) ::: projection of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s south [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md) onto the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) <!--SR:!2024-07-10,10,293!2024-07-15,13,293-->
  - [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md) ::: the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)'s apparent path [eastward](../../../../general/east.md) through the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) during the year <!--SR:!2024-07-18,16,313!2024-07-20,18,313-->
- [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) ::: It equals the angle between the (celestial) [equatorial plane](../../../../general/equator.md) and the [ecliptic plane](../../../../general/ecliptic.md). For [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md), this angle is 23.5°. <!--SR:!2024-07-15,13,293!2024-07-12,10,293-->
- [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) [galaxy class](../../../../general/galaxy%20morphological%20classification.md) ::: [flat spiral galaxy](../../../../general/spiral%20galaxy.md) <!--SR:!2024-07-10,10,293!2024-07-17,15,313-->
- [galactic plane](../../../../general/galactic%20plane.md) ::: The [plane](../../../../general/plane%20(geometry).md) on which the majority of a disk-shaped [galaxy](../../../../general/galaxy.md)'s [mass](../../../../general/mass.md) lies. For us, the galactic plane of [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) blocks our view  of the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) outside the Milky Way in the direction parallel to the plane. <!--SR:!2024-07-15,13,293!2024-07-13,11,293-->

- [Earth-centered, Earth-fixed coordinate system](../../../../general/Earth-centered,%20Earth-fixed%20coordinate%20system.md) ::: Acronym is ECEF. It is a [cartesian](../../../../general/Cartesian%20coordinate%20system.md) [spatial reference system](../../../../general/spatial%20reference%20system.md) that represents location using _X_, _Y_, and _Z_ from the [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s [center of mass](../../../../general/center%20of%20mass.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-19,17,317!2024-07-14,12,297-->
- star movement
  - [celestial sphere § description](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md#description)
  - [diurnal motion](../../../../general/diurnal%20motion.md)
  - What do the [constellations](../../../../general/constellation.md) we see depend on? ::: One is the [latitude](../../../../general/latitude.md), as it determines the [horizon](../../../../general/horizon.md), and thus visible and hidden [stars](../../../../general/star.md). The other one is the time of year, because the [Sun](Sun.md) moves along the [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md) on the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) and stars are only visible at nighttime away from the Sun. <!--SR:!2024-07-12,10,297!2024-07-14,12,297-->
  - [circumpolar star](../../../../general/circumpolar%20star.md) ::: [Stars](../../../../general/star.md) that never sets below the [horizon](../../../../general/horizon.md), as observed from a specific location on [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-20,18,317!2024-07-16,14,297-->
  - altitude of the north [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md) equals... ::: ...equals your [latitude](../../../../general/latitude.md) (works even if the number is negative) <!--SR:!2024-07-12,10,297!2024-07-20,18,317-->
- [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md)
  - [§ finding the north celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md#finding%20the%20north%20celestial%20pole)
  - [§ finding the south celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md#finding%20the%20south%20celestial%20pole)
  - [§ method one: the Southern Cross](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md#method%20one%20the%20Southern%20Cross)
- [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md)
  - [§ astrology](../../../../general/ecliptic.md#astrology)
  - [zodiac](../../../../general/zodiac.md)
    - zodiac § [Ophiuchus](../../../../general/Ophiuchus.md) ::: The feet of [Ophiuchus](../../../../general/Ophiuchus.md) touches the [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md) and is in between [Sagittarius](../../../../general/Sagittarius%20(constellation).md) and [Scorpius](../../../../general/Scorpius.md), but is not in the 12 [zodiac signs](../../../../general/astrological%20sign.md). (Note that zodiac signs do not actually correspond to the [constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md) boundaries in general, due to the [axial precession](../../../../general/axial%20precession.md) of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). Thus, it is not the "13th zodiac sign"). <!--SR:!2024-07-13,11,297!2024-07-13,11,297-->
    - [astrological sign](../../../../general/astrological%20sign.md) ::: [Pseudoscience](../../../../general/pseudoscience.md). The 12 signs are named after 12 of the [constellations](../../../../general/constellation.md) touching the [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md). Note that the time of the signs do not correspond with the positions of the constellations in general. <!--SR:!2024-07-14,12,297!2024-07-17,15,317-->
- [solar time](../../../../general/solar%20time.md) ::: Similar to the "time" we are familiar with. It is based on the [position of the Sun](../../../../general/position%20of%20the%20Sun.md) in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-13,11,297!2024-07-12,10,297-->
  - [solar day](../../../../general/synodic%20day.md) ::: About 24 hours for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). Similar to the "day" we are familiar with. The time between two occurrences of the same [position of the Sun](../../../../general/position%20of%20the%20Sun.md) in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-14,12,297!2024-07-16,14,297-->
- [sidereal time](../../../../general/sidereal%20time.md) ::: Not the "time" we are familiar with. It is based on the positions of the [fixed stars](../../../../general/fixed%20stars.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-18,16,317!2024-07-15,13,297-->
  - sidereal day ::: About 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). Not the "day" we are familiar with. The time it takes for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) to rotate 360° around its own axis. Usually uses the positions of [fixed stars](../../../../general/fixed%20stars.md) as reference. <!--SR:!2024-07-12,10,297!2024-07-19,17,317-->
    - implications of the sidereal day being shorter than solar day for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::: Every (solar) day, stars appear in the same position in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md) about 3 minutes 56 seconds earlier. <!--SR:!2024-07-13,11,297!2024-07-19,17,317-->
  - [§ comparison to solar time](../../../../general/sidereal%20time.md#comparison%20to%20solar%20time) ::: Solar day and sidereal day lengths are different. For most planets, which are in [prograde motion](../../../../general/retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) (the [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) spins in the same direction as its orbital direction), the solar day is longer than the sidereal day. Consider a planet and a point on the planet initially facing its parent star. Consider after it has spined 360°, corresponding to a sidereal day. In that time, the planet has progressed in the orbit as well, thus the direction of the parent star has also advanced in the spinning direction. So more time is needed for the point to "catch up" so that it faces the parent star again. Thus, a solar day is longer than the sidereal day. Uncommonly, if the motion is retrograde instead, then reverse the above argument to get the conclusion that a solar day is shorter than a sidereal day. <!--SR:!2024-07-16,14,297!2024-07-15,13,297-->
  - [§ sidereal days compared to solar days on other planets](../../../../general/sidereal%20time.md#sidereal%20days%20compared%20to%20solar%20days%20on%20other%20planets) ::: For [prograde motion](../../../../general/retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) (the [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) spins in the same direction as its orbital direction, which is true for most planets), the formula is $$\text{number of solar days per orbital period} = \text{number of sidereal days per orbital period} - 1$$. For retrograde motion, the formula is $$\text{number of solar days per orbital period} = \text{number of sidereal days per orbital period} + 1$$. The length formulas can easily be derived from above. <!--SR:!2024-07-12,10,297!2024-07-12,10,297-->
- [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md)
  - [axial parallelism](../../../../general/axial%20parallelism.md) ::: Ignoring [axial precession](../../../../general/axial%20precession.md) (which are long-term minor variations in the [rotation axis](../../../../general/rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md)), [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s [rotation axis](../../../../general/rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md) remains fixed. That is, the [North Pole](../../../../general/North%20Pole.md) always point to the [Polaris](../../../../general/Polaris.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-21,18,321!2024-07-19,16,320-->
  - [§ seasons](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md#seasons)
- [season](../../../../general/season.md)
  - [§ axial parallelism](../../../../general/season.md#axial%20parallelism)
  - [§ axial tilt](../../../../general/season.md#axial%20tilt)
  - season [§ elliptical Earth orbit](../../../../general/season.md#elliptical%20Earth%20orbit) ::: The [Earth orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md) being elliptical does not affect the seasons much. As the Earth's [orbital distance](../../../../general/semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes.md) varies by about 3%, sunlight received varies by only about 7%. (In fact, the Earth is farther away in the [summer](../../../../general/summer.md) for the [Northern Hemisphere](../../../../general/Northern%20Hemisphere.md).) For the same reason, some parts of the [Earth's surface](geoid.md) being closer or farther (but not angle of the surface) due to [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) also does not contribute much, considering the distance difference—up to only thousands of [kilometers](../../../../general/kilometre.md)—is even smaller. Both effects are overwhelmed by the effect of axial parallelism and axial tilt. <!--SR:!2024-07-09,7,281!2024-07-20,17,321-->
- [surface power density](../../../../general/surface%20power%20density.md) ::: [power](../../../../general/power%20(physics).md) per unit [area](../../../../general/area.md), e.g. [solar irradiance](../../../../general/solar%20irradiance.md) <!--SR:!2024-07-20,17,320!2024-07-19,16,320-->
  - [solar irradiance](../../../../general/solar%20irradiance.md), solar flux ::: The [power](../../../../general/power%20(physics).md) per unit [area](../../../../general/area.md) ([surface power density](../../../../general/surface%20power%20density.md)) received from the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), typically measured in [watts](../../../../general/watt.md) per [square meter](../../../../general/square%20metre.md) (W/m<sup>2</sup>) in [SI units](../../../../general/International%20System%20of%20Units.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-21,18,321!2024-07-18,15,320-->
    - [solar flux](../../../../general/solar%20irradiance.md) & [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) ::: [Axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) makes the [sunlight](../../../../general/sunlight.md) not necessarily hit the surface [perpendicularly](../../../../general/perpendicular.md). When it is not perpendicular, the same amount of sunlight is spread over a larger surface area. This effect can be approximated as: $$\text{solar flux} = \text{solar power} \cdot \cos \theta$$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the [normal](../../../../general/normal%20(geometry).md) of the surface and the direction of solar radiation. <!--SR:!2024-07-22,19,320!2024-07-22,19,320-->
- [analemma](../../../../general/analemma.md)
  - [analemma](../../../../general/analemma.md) & [season](../../../../general/season.md) ::: The [analemma](../../../../general/analemma.md) at [noon](../../../../general/noon.md) shows the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)'s altitude on the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) at noon in any particular day of the year. Higher altitude means the [sunlight](../../../../general/sunlight.md) is more direct, so it is [summer](../../../../general/summer.md). Conversely, lower altitude means the sunlight is less direct, so it is [winter](../../../../general/winter.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-11,9,280!2024-07-19,16,320-->
  - analemma direction ::: The Sun moves eastward on the analemma near the solstices (the top and bottom of the 8 figure). <!--SR:!2024-07-27,20,337!2024-07-22,15,335-->

  - equinox names ::: spring/vernal equinox, fall/autumnal equinox, March equinox, September equinox <!--SR:!2024-07-23,16,335!2024-07-25,18,337-->
    - spring/vernal equinox, fall/autumnal equinox vs. [March equinox](../../../../general/March%20equinox.md), [September equinox](../../../../general/September%20equinox.md) ::: The former depends on the hemisphere while the latter does not. For the Northern hemisphere, spring/vernal equinox is March equinox and fall/autumnal equinox is September equinox. This is reversed for the Southern hemisphere. <!--SR:!2024-07-26,19,337!2024-07-26,19,337-->
  - March equinox date ::: March 21/22@UT+08 (19–21@UT) <!--SR:!2024-07-19,12,315!2024-07-15,8,295-->

- [solstice](../../../../general/solstice.md) ::: Axis tilt is at the largest angle with regards to the Sun. The Sun is farthest away from the celestial equator on the celestial sphere. One hemisphere receives more sunlight than the other. <!--SR:!2024-07-25,18,335!2024-07-23,16,337-->
  - solstice etymology ::: sol "sun" + stice "stopped", "stationary" <!--SR:!2024-07-26,19,337!2024-07-26,19,335-->
  - solstice names ::: summer solstice, winter solstice, June solstice, December solstice <!--SR:!2024-07-27,20,337!2024-07-22,15,335-->
    - [summer solstice](../../../../general/summer%20solstice.md), [winter solstice](../../../../winter%20solstice.md) vs. [June solstice](../../../../general/June%20solstice.md), [December solstice](../../../../general/December%20solstice.md) ::: The former depends on the hemisphere while the latter does not. For the Northern hemisphere, summer solstice is June solstice and winter solstice is December solstice. This is reversed for the Southern hemisphere. <!--SR:!2024-07-27,20,337!2024-07-27,20,337-->
  - June solstice date ::: June 21/22@UT+08 (20–22@UT) <!--SR:!2024-07-16,9,295!2024-07-27,20,337-->
  - December solstice date ::: December 21/22@UT+08 (20–22@UT) <!--SR:!2024-07-18,11,317!2024-07-19,12,315-->
- [sun path](../../../../general/sun%20path.md) ::: Identify today's Sun position on the ecliptic. Then draw a circle passing through that position and parallel to the celestial equator. This is the path the Sun (roughly) takes on that day. According to the ecliptic, the Sun position oscillates around the celestial equator _over a year_. Then one can see how the path the Sun takes _over a day_ oscillates over a year. By this, one can also see how altitude of the Sun and daytime length change. <!--SR:!2024-07-20,13,317!2024-07-24,17,335-->
  - sun path at polar regions ::: On some days, the circle over a day does not go below or above the horizon. <!--SR:!2024-07-25,18,337!2024-07-21,14,315-->
  - sun path at tropics ::: The Sun is not at the highest altitude on the celestial sphere for both solstices, unlike locations at temperate latitudes. On the equator, the Sun is at the highest altitude during the equinoxes instead. <!--SR:!2024-07-26,19,337!2024-07-21,14,317-->
- [Tropic of Cancer](../../../../general/Tropic%20of%20Cancer.md) ::: Currently 23°26′10.0″ (or 23.43611°) north of the equator. <!--SR:!2024-07-16,9,297!2024-07-26,19,335-->
  - [Tropic of Cancer § name](../../../../general/Tropic%20of%20Cancer.md#name) ::: It was named after the constellation Cancer during last centuries BCE, as the Sun was there on the June solstice. Due to westward precession of the equinoxes, this is no longer the case. The current constellation is Gemini. <!--SR:!2024-07-23,16,335!2024-07-23,16,335-->
- [Tropic of Capricorn](../../../../general/Tropic%20of%20Capricorn.md) ::: Currently 23°26′10.0″ (or 23.43611°) south of the equator. <!--SR:!2024-07-14,7,295!2024-07-24,17,337-->
  - [Tropic of Capricorn § name](../../../../general/Tropic%20of%20Capricorn.md#name) ::: It was named after the constellation Capricorn during last centuries BCE, as the Sun was there on the December solstice. Due to westward precession of the equinoxes, this is no longer the case. The current constellation is Sagittarius. <!--SR:!2024-07-24,17,335!2024-07-25,18,337-->
- [Arctic Circle](../../../../general/Arctic%20Circle.md) ::: About 66°33′50.0″ north of the equator. The southernmost altitude at which the Sun does not set for at least 24 continuous hours per year. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,12,317!2024-07-25,18,337-->
- [Antarctic Circle](../../../../general/Antarctic%20Circle.md) ::: About 66°33′50.0″ south of the equator. The northernmost altitude at which the Sun does not set for at least 24 continuous hours per year. <!--SR:!2024-07-22,15,317!2024-07-23,16,335-->
- 4 [seasons](season.md) as we know it ::: The 4 seasons as we know it only happen at temperate latitudes. For tropics (latitudes in between the tropics), the seasons become the _dry season_ and the _wet season_, or may not exist at all like in alpines and deserts. For polar regions (latitudes in the Arctic or Antarctic Circle), the sun does not set on some days during the "summer", and does not rise for some days during the "winter". This is apparent when considering the sun path oscillation, restricted to the visible parts of the celestial sphere. <!--SR:!2024-07-15,8,295!2024-07-24,17,337-->
- [axial precession](../../../../general/axial%20precession.md) ::: The orientation of Earth's axis of rotation gradually shifts westward (opposite of the Earth's direction of rotation) in a circle over a period of about 26&nbsp;000 years. <!--SR:!2024-07-26,18,339!2024-07-25,17,339-->
  - axial precession effects ::: One effect is that the celestial poles points at a different direction, changing the pole stars (e.g. the north star will eventually no longer be Polaris). The other is that the constellations the Sun's projection is on during the equinoxes and solstices shifts westward along the zodiac. <!--SR:!2024-07-26,19,337!2024-07-27,20,337-->
- [solar term](../../../../general/solar%20term.md) ::: One of the 24 periods in traditional Chinese lunisolar calendars. <!--SR:!2024-07-24,17,335!2024-07-22,15,335-->

  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / rotation direction ::: counterclockwise viewed from north; prograde to its own rotation direction, prograde to Earth's rotation direction <!--SR:!2024-07-28,20,339!2024-07-18,11,319-->
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / synodic [orbital period](../../../../general/orbital%20period.md) (with respect to [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)) ::: about 29.5 days <!--SR:!2024-07-19,12,319!2024-07-28,20,339-->
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / synodic [rotation period](../../../../general/rotation%20period%20(astronomy).md) (with respect to the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)) ::: about 29.5 days = synodic orbital period (due to tidal locking) <!--SR:!2024-07-24,16,339!2024-07-24,16,339-->
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / [tidal locking](../../../../general/tidal%20locking.md) (misnomer: synchronous orbit) ::: The orbital period equals the rotation period. That means the same near side is always exposed to the Earth. The far side is also called the "dark side of the Moon". <!--SR:!2024-07-23,15,319!2024-07-28,20,339-->
  - [lunar phase](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md) ::: Cycles once every lunar month, which is about 29.5 days, which is the same as the synodic rotation period. Caused by changing relative orbital positions of the Moon, Earth, and the Sun, as the Moon orbits around Earth and Earth orbits around the Sun. Half of the Moon is always sunlit (the side facing the Sun), but as the visible side (the side facing the Earth) shifts relative to the sunlit side, so the portion of visible side that is sunlit changes. <!--SR:!2024-07-17,10,319!2024-07-18,11,319-->
    - [lunar phase § principal and intermediate phases of the Moon](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md#principal%20and%20intermediate%20phases%20of%20the%20Moon) ::: new moon -> waxing crescent -> first quarter -> waxing gibbous -> full moon -> waning gibbous -> third quarter -> waning crescent -> (new moon) <!--SR:!2024-07-23,15,319!2024-07-27,19,339-->
      - [lunar phase § principal and intermediate phases of the Moon](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md#principal%20and%20intermediate%20phases%20of%20the%20Moon) / memorization ::: New moon and full moon are easily remembered. Then insert the 2 quarters, first quarter and third quarter, respectively in between new moon and full moon, and in between full moon and next new moon. Finally, in between each of the 4 phases, including between third quarter and next new moon, insert the 4 minor phases. The 4 minor phases is a word combination of waxing or waning, and crescent or gibbous. Waxing means "increasing" while waning means "decreasing". Crescent means "sickle moon" while gibbous means "convex" or "protuberant", so the former is thinner than the latter. <!--SR:!2024-07-23,15,319!2024-07-17,10,319-->
    - [lunar phase](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md) / moonrise and moonset ::: Each day, the Moon advances in its orbit slightly, delaying moonrise and moonset daily by about 50 minutes. The moonrise and moonset times correspond to the moon phases, and resets every lunar month. <!--SR:!2024-07-21,14,319!2024-07-26,18,339-->
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / sidereal [orbital period](../../../../general/orbital%20period.md) ::: about 27.3 days <!--SR:!2024-07-25,17,339!2024-07-25,17,339-->

- [orbital period § synodic period](../../../../general/orbital%20period.md#synodic%20period) ::: It is the orbital period of a body orbiting a second body, using a third body as the reference. (The second body and the third body can be the same.) It is also the time between [conjunctions](conjunction%20(astronomy).md) of the second body and the third body as viewed from the first body. For observers on [Earth](Earth.md), the usual reference (third body) is the [Sun](Sun.md). <!--SR:!2024-07-14,7,299!2024-07-28,20,339-->
  - [orbital period § synodic period](../../../../general/orbital%20period.md#synodic%20period) / calculation ::: For 2 bodies orbiting in the same direction, $$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} - \frac 1 {T_2} \qquad T_1 < T_2$$. For 2 bodies orbiting in opposing direction, $$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} + \frac 1 {T_2}$$. <!--SR:!2024-07-27,19,339!2024-07-24,16,339-->

  - [§ from Earth](../../../../general/apparent%20retrograde%20motion.md#from%20Earth)
  - explaining apparent retrograde motion ::: The inner planet moves faster than the outer planet when they are near conjunctions, so the relative velocity reverses and apparent retrograde motion occurs. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,11,320!2024-07-09,4,320-->
    - explaining apparent retrograde motion in ancient times ::: As most ancients thought that Earth is the center, it is harder to explain. Their explanation was using deferents and epicycles. <!--SR:!2024-07-09,4,320!2024-07-09,4,320-->
- [stellar parallax](../../../../general/stellar%20parallax.md)
- reason the (very) ancient Greeks thought Earth is the center ::: They cannot observe stellar parallax of the fixed stars. There were 2 plausible explanations for them. One was the fixed stars are too far away so the stellar parallax is too small to be observed with the naked eye. The other was Earth is the center of the universe. With rare exceptions, the first (and correct) option was rejected by most (very) ancient Greeks because they could not believe that fixed stars are _that_ far away. <!--SR:!2024-07-09,4,320!2024-07-09,4,320-->
