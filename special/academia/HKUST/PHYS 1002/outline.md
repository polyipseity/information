- [Hubble Ultra-Deep Field](../../../../general/Hubble%20Ultra-Deep%20Field.md)
- HKUST in the universe ::: HKUST is a very small place compared to the universe
- observing HKUST ::: different views depending on where we are and where we look, so multiple observations are required to reveal the true HKUST
- observing the universe ::: unfortunately, we can only observe the universe from the inside at one (almost) fixed location (see 蘇軾《題西林壁》)
  - Does that mean we will never understand the universe? ::: Not quite, we have a good but not perfect understanding of our universe, and can construct a 3D or 4D model of it.
- old world maps ::: can be very different due to limited technology; compare a world map believed to be compiled by Zheng He (1371–1435) and the Martellus world map (1490)
- "cosmic address" ::: the universe -> Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex (galaxy filament and void) -> Local Supercluster -> Local Group -> Milky Way (galaxy) -> Solar System -> Earth -> ...
- the universe in numbers ::: the [observable universe](../../../../general/observable%20universe.md): ~10<sup>11</sup> galaxies, each galaxy: ~10<sup>11</sup> stars
- astronomical structures
  - [star](../../../../general/star.md) ::: A large, glowing ball of gas that generates heat and light via nuclear fusion.
    - star surface ::: bubbling convection cells that rise and fall across the surface
      - star surface example ::: the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), with ~700&nbsp;000 km<sup>2</sup> cells, observed by [Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope](../../../../Daniel%20K.%20Inouye%20Solar%20Telescope.md)

    - [radiation zone](../../../../general/radiation%20zone.md) ::: ...where heat flow mainly consists of [radiation](../../../../general/radiation.md) and [conduction](../../../../thermal%20conduction.md)
      - radiation zone radiation detection ::: The radiation from the radiation zone can be detected and analyzed via [astronomical spectroscopy](../../../../astronomical%20spectroscopy.md). This produces a spectrum, which is _mostly_ similar to a [black body](../../../../general/black%20body.md), but the _small_ differences are significant and tell us about many properties of the [star](../../../../general/star.md).
  - [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) ::: A moderately large object that orbits a [star](../../../../general/star.md). It shines by reflecting light from the star. It may be rocky, icy, or gaseous in composition.
    - planet examples ::: [Mars](../../../../general/Mars.md) ([rocky planet](../../../../general/terrestrial%20planet.md)), [Jupiter](../../../../general/Jupiter.md) ([gas giant](../../../../general/gas%20giant.md)), [Neptune](../../../../general/Neptune.md) ([ice giant](../../../../general/ice%20giant.md))
  - [dwarf planet](../../../../general/dwarf%20planet.md)
    - dwarf planet examples ::: [Eris](../../../../general/Eris%20(dwarf%20planet).md), [Pluto](../../../../general/Pluto.md) (reclassified in 2006), major objects in the [Kuiper Belt](../../../../general/Kuiper%20belt.md)
  - long orbital periods ::: 1 Pluto year ≈ 248.1 Earth years, 1 Eris year ≈ 557 Earth years
  - [asteroid](../../../../general/asteroid.md) ::: A relatively small and _rocky_ object orbiting a [star](../../../../general/star.md). Often non-spherical due to insufficient gravity. It is a [minor planet](../../../../general/minor%20planet.md) that orbits within the [inner Solar System](../../../../general/Solar%20System.md#inner%20Solar%20System).
    - asteroid examples ::: many asteroids in the [Kuiper Belt](../../../../general/Kuiper%20Belt.md)
  - [comet](../../../../general/comet.md) ::: A relatively small and _icy_ object that orbits a [star](../../../../general/star.md). The heat from the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) melts the ice to form the tail when the comet is close.
    - asteroid vs. comet ::: The basic difference is its composition: rocky vs. icy.
  - [natural satellite](../../../../general/natural%20satellite.md) or moon ::: An object that orbits a [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) or [dwarf planet](../../../../general/dwarf%20planet.md). (Man-made objects are simply called _satellites_.)
    - natural satellite examples ::: [Ganymede](../../../../general/Ganymede%20(moon).md) ([Jupiter](../../../../general/Jupiter.md)), the [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) ([Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md))
  - [planetary system](../../../../general/planetary%20system.md) (misnomer: [star system](../../../../general/star%20system.md)) ::: A [star](../../../../general/star.md) and all the materials that [orbits](orbit.md) it, including its [planets](../../../../general/planet.md) and [moons](../../../../general/natural%20satellite.md).
    - planetary system examples ::: [Solar System](../../../../general/Solar%20System.md)
  - [nebula](../../../../general/nebula.md) ::: An interstellar cloud of gas and/or dust.
  - [galaxy](../../../../general/galaxy.md) ::: A great island of (on average 10<sup>11</sup>) [stars](../../../../general/star.md) bound together by [gravity](../../../../general/gravity.md) and [orbiting](orbit.md) a common center.
    - galaxy examples ::: [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md)
  - [galaxy group](../../../../general/galaxy%20group.md) ::: A collection of _50 or fewer_ [galaxies](../../../../general/galaxy.md) bound by [gravity](../../../../general/gravity.md).
    - galaxy group examples ::: [Local Group](../../../../geneeral/Local%20Group.md)
  - [galaxy cluster](../../../../general/galaxy%20cluster.md) ::: A collection of _more than 50_ [galaxies](../../../../general/galaxy.md) bound by [gravity](../../../../general/gravity.md).
  - [supercluster](../../../../general/supercluster.md) ::: A gigantic region of [space](../../../../general/outer%20space.md) in which many groups and clusters are packed more closely together (not necessarily bounded by [gravity](../../../../general/gravity.md)) than elsewhere.
    - supercluster examples ::: [Local Supercluster](../../../../general/Virgo%20Supercluster.md)
  - [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) ::: The totality of everything that exists, including space, time, matter, and energy.
- [mass–energy equivalence](../../../../general/mass–energy%20equivalence.md) ::: $$E = mc^2$$: mass and energy are equivalent (differ only by a multiplicative constant and the units of measurement)
- brief history of the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) ::: [Big Bang](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md) (13.8 billion years ago) -> galaxy formation -> star evolution (cycle: formation -> fuel consumption -> death) -> Earth
  - How to know what [Hong Kong](../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md) was like in the past? ::: Look at historic photos of [Hong Kong](../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md).
  - How to know what the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) was like in the past? ::: Look far enough, because the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) is extremely big.
- [speed of light](../../../../general/speed%20of%20light.md) ::: exactly 299&nbsp;792&nbsp;458 m/s _in vacuum_, often approximated as 300&nbsp;000 km/s; 8 times around the Earth in 1 second
  - light travel time from Earth to... ::: the Moon: ~1.3 second, the Sun: ~8 minutes, Sirius (brightest star in the night sky): ~8 years, Andromeda Galaxy (nearest major galaxy): ~2.5 million years
  - speed of light implications ::: We see astronomical objects as they were in the past since they are so far away. The further the object is in distance, the further back we look back into time.
- [lookback time](../../../../general/cosmic%20time.md#lookback%20time)
- [light-year](../../../../general/light-year.md) ::: the distance light travels in one year; exactly 9460&nbsp;730&nbsp;472&nbsp;580&nbsp;800 m, approximately 9.4607 × 10<sup>15</sup> m
  - light-year unofficial variation ::: We use 365 days in a year instead of 365.25 to calculate 1 light-year in the PowerPoint. But 365.25 should be acceptable either way...
- [observable universe](../../../../general/observable%20universe.md) ::: It has a radius (in [comoving distance](../../../../general/comoving%20and%20proper%20distances.md)) of 46.5 billion light-years instead of 13.8 billion light-years due to expansion of the universe.
  - Can we see the entire [universe](../../../../general/universe.md)? ::: No. Estimates suggest that the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) is at least 250 times larger (in volume) than a [Hubble sphere](../../../../general/Hubble%20volume.md).
- [scale of the universe @ HKUST](scale%20of%20the%20universe%20@%20HKUST.md) ::: a 1:10<sup>10</sup> (length) model
- number of stars in the [observable universe](../../../../general/observable%20universe.md) ::: 10<sup>11</sup> stars/galaxy × 10<sup>11</sup> galaxies = 10<sup>22</sup> stars
  - number of stars in the [observable universe](../../../../general/observable%20universe.md) analogy ::: The [observable universe](../../../../general/observable%20universe.md) has as many stars as the number of grains of dry sand on all of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s beaches. Imagine the time needed to count each grain of sand 1 per second.

## week 1 lecture 2

- time: 2024-06-20T10:00:00+08:00/2024-06-20T12:30:00+08:00
- [Cosmic Calendar](../../../../general/Cosmic%20Calendar.md) ::: Compress the entire history of the universe till now (13.8 billion years) into 1 year. 1 month ≈ 1.2 billion yrs, 1 day ≈ 40 million yrs, 1 sec ≈ 440 yrs
  - Cosmic Calendar highlights ::: The [Solar System](../../../../general/Solar%20System.md) formed on September. Dinosaurs appeared on Christmas (25 Dec) and extincted yesterday (30 Dec). All of recorded human history occurred in the last 30 seconds. We (age of ~20) were born 0.05 seconds before.
- Are we ever standing still? ::: No! Consider the movement of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md), the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), and [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md).
- movement of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::: [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md), [Earth's orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md), movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)
  - [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md) ::: [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) rotates on its axis once very day (~24 h). Its [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) is about 23.5°, pointing to [Polaris](../../../../general/Polaris.md).
  - [Earth's orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md) ::: [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) orbits the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) once a year at an average distance of 1 [AU](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md), in counterclockwise direction as viewed from above.
    - [astronomical unit](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md) ::: 1 [AU](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md) = 149&nbsp;597&nbsp;870&nbsp;700 m ≈ 150 million km
    - Earth's orbital speed ::: surprisingly quick, 29.78 km/s or 107&nbsp;200 km/h
  - Why do we not feel the movement of Earth even if it is moving very quickly? ::: Although Earth moves very quickly, its acceleration is very little. As we feel acceleration but not velocity, we do not feel the Earth moving. (Imagine riding on trains which are respectively accelerating, in constant velocity, and decelerating.) For [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md), consider that the [angular velocity](../../../../general/angular%20velocity.md) is very small.
  - [angular velocity](../../../../general/angular%20velocity.md) ::: Angular velocity is $\omega = \frac {v_{\perp} } r$, where $v_{\perp}$ is the signed (+: counterclockwise, -: clockwise) magnitude of the tangential velocity and $r$ is the radius from the rotation center.
- movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) ::: [solar apex](../../../../general/solar%20apex.md), [orbit of the Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md#motion), movement of the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md)
  - [solar apex § direction](../../../../general/solar%20apex.md#direction) ::: The [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) moves relative to the local solar neighborhood ([local standard of rest](../../../../general/local%20standard%20of%20rest.md)) at about 72&nbsp;000 km/h. (Actually, this was the measured speed before 1986, but we will use it here anyway.)
  - [orbit of the Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md#motion) ::: The [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) orbits around the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) center about every 230 million years at a speed of about 800&nbsp;000 km/h.
  - Why do we not notice the movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) relative to the [stars](../../../../general/star.md) even if it is moving extremely quickly? ::: This is because the distance between [stars](../../../../general/star.md) is even larger. In a 1:10<sup>10</sup> model, the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)'s speed 70&nbsp;000 km/h is 0.7 cm/h. Compare this to the scaled distance of 4400 km (4.4 ly) between the Sun and [Alpha Centauri](../../../../general/Alpha%20Centauri.md). One implication is that stars appear to be stationary over lifetimes of many generations, allowing the concept of [constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md).
- [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) fun fact ::: While most of the light come from the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md)'s bulge and disk, most of its mass is in its halo. ([dark matter](../../../../general/dark%20matter.md))
- movement of the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) ::: [approaching the Andromeda Galaxy](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md#intergalactic%20neighborhood), [Hubble's law](../../../../general/Hubble's%20law.md)
  - [approaching the Andromeda Galaxy](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md#intergalactic%20neighborhood) ::: at about 300&nbsp;000 km/h
  - [Hubble's law](../../../../general/Hubble's%20law.md) ::: Attributed to [Edwin Hubble](../../../../general/Edwin%20Hubble.md). All [galaxies](../../../../general/galaxy.md) outside our [Local Group](../../../../general/Local%20Group.md) are moving away from us, with the speeds proportional to their distances.
    - Hubble's law implications ::: An evidence for the [expansion of the universe](../../../../general/expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md). Consider [raisins](../../../../general/raisin.md) (galaxies) in a rising loaf of bread (the universe). Raisins further apart from each other move away from each other faster.
- recurring patterns on [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::: day: circling sky, month: phases of the [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md), year: 4 seasons
- How does the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) look like from [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) using the naked eye? ::: We can see more than 2000 [stars](../../../../general/star.md) as well as the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md). (Unfortunately, due to light pollution, many [stars](../../../../general/star.md) cannot be seen from [Hong Kong](../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md).)
- [constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md) ::: A region of the sky. There are 88 of them. Most names come from the imagination of ancient people. They are now used as landmarks by modern [astronomers](../../../../general/astronomer.md).
- [asterism](../../../../general/asterism%20(astronomy).md) ::: An observed pattern of [stars](../../../../general/star.md) in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md). More general than [constellations](../../../../general/constellation.md).
  - asterism examples ::: the [Big Dipper](../../../../general/Big%20Dipper.md), [Ursa Major](../../../../general/Ursa%20Major.md) ([constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md))
  - the [Big Dipper](../../../../general/Big%20Dipper.md) ::: It consists of the 7 brightest stars of the constellation [Ursa Major](../../../../general/Ursa%20Major.md). (Also known as BeiDou (Chinese: 北斗). The [BeiDou](../../../../general/BeiDou.md) Navigation Satellite System (BDS) is named after it.)
- Are stars in an asterism or constellation of the same cluster and similar distance? ::: No! They can very far apart from each other, like many light-years away.
- motion of the [stars](../../../../general/star.md) ::: They go around us once per day, like how the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) rises and sets.
- [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) (Chinese: 天球) ::: An imaginary sphere with [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) as the center.
  - Why do stars appear to be fixed on the celestial sphere? And what are the exceptions? ::: Even if the stars (Chinese: 恆星 for 'unmoving star') are moving very quickly (described in km), their distances to us are even higher (described in ly), so they _appear_ fixed. The [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md), the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), and [planets](../../../../general/planet.md) (Chinese: 行星 for 'moving star') are much closer and moves slowly (but detectable to naked eyes) on the sphere.
  - horizon ::: plane tangent to the ground, depends on your location
  - [zenith](../../../../general/zenith.md) ::: point on the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) directly overhead, depends on your location
  - [nadir](../../../../general/nadir.md) ::: point on the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) directly underneath, depends on your location
  - [celestial equator](../../../../general/celestial%20equator.md) ::: projection of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s equator onto the [celestial sphere](celestial%20sphere.md)
  - north [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md) ::: projection of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s north [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md) onto the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md)
  - south [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md) ::: projection of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s south [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md) onto the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md)
  - [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md) ::: the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)'s apparent path [eastward](../../../../general/east.md) through the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) during the year
- [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) ::: It equals the angle between the (celestial) [equatorial plane](../../../../general/equator.md) and the [ecliptic plane](../../../../general/ecliptic.md). For [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md), this angle is 23.5°.
- [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) [galaxy class](../../../../general/galaxy%20morphological%20classification.md) ::: [flat spiral galaxy](../../../../general/spiral%20galaxy.md)
- [galactic plane](../../../../general/galactic%20plane.md) ::: The [plane](../../../../general/plane%20(geometry).md) on which the majority of a disk-shaped [galaxy](../../../../general/galaxy.md)'s [mass](../../../../general/mass.md) lies. For us, the galactic plane of [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) blocks our view  of the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) outside the Milky Way in the direction parallel to the plane.
- [horizontal coordinate system](../../../../general/horizontal%20coordinate%20system.md) ::: coordinate system based on the local sky
  - [§ definition](../../../../general/horizontal%20coordinate%20system.md#definition)
  - [meridian](../../../../general/meridian%20(astronomy).md)

## week 2 lecture 2

- time: 2024-06-27T10:00:00+08:00/2024-06-27T12:30:00+08:00
- [angular diameter](../../../../general/angular%20diameter.md)
  - [§ formula](../../../../general/angular%20diameter.md#formula)
- [arcminute & arcsecond](../../../../general/minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc.md)
- [latitude](../../../../general/latitude.md), [longitude](../../../../general/longitude.md)
  - [prime meridian](../../../../general/prime%20meridian.md) of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::: 0° longitude; at [Greenwich](../../../../general/Greenwich.md)
- [Earth-centered, Earth-fixed coordinate system](../../../../general/Earth-centered,%20Earth-fixed%20coordinate%20system.md) ::: Acronym is ECEF. It is a [cartesian](../../../../general/Cartesian%20coordinate%20system.md) [spatial reference system](../../../../general/spatial%20reference%20system.md) that represents location using _X_, _Y_, and _Z_ from the [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s [center of mass](../../../../general/center%20of%20mass.md).
- star movement
  - [celestial sphere § description](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md#description)
  - [diurnal motion](../../../../general/diurnal%20motion.md)
  - What do the [constellations](../../../../general/constellation.md) we see depend on? ::: One is the [latitude](../../../../general/latitude.md), as it determines the [horizon](../../../../general/horizon.md), and thus visible and hidden [stars](../../../../general/star.md). The other one is the time of year, because the [Sun](Sun.md) moves along the [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md) on the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) and stars are only visible at nighttime away from the Sun.
  - [circumpolar star](../../../../general/circumpolar%20star.md) ::: [Stars](../../../../general/star.md) that never sets below the [horizon](../../../../general/horizon.md), as observed from a specific location on [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md).
  - altitude of the north [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md) equals... ::: ...equals your [latitude](../../../../general/latitude.md) (works even if the number is negative)
- [celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md)
  - [§ finding the north celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md#finding%20the%20north%20celestial%20pole)
  - [§ finding the south celestial pole](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md#finding%20the%20south%20celestial%20pole)
  - [§ method one: the Southern Cross](../../../../general/celestial%20pole.md#method%20one%20the%20Southern%20Cross)
- [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md)
  - [§ astrology](../../../../general/ecliptic.md#astrology)
  - [zodiac](../../../../general/zodiac.md)
    - zodiac § [Ophiuchus](../../../../general/Ophiuchus.md) ::: The feet of [Ophiuchus](../../../../general/Ophiuchus.md) touches the [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md) and is in between [Sagittarius](../../../../general/Sagittarius%20(constellation).md) and [Scorpius](../../../../general/Scorpius.md), but is not in the 12 [zodiac signs](../../../../general/astrological%20sign.md). (Note that zodiac signs do not actually correspond to the [constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md) boundaries in general, due to the [axial precession](../../../../general/axial%20precession.md) of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). Thus, it is not the "13th zodiac sign").
    - [astrological sign](../../../../general/astrological%20sign.md) ::: [Pseudoscience](../../../../general/pseudoscience.md). The 12 signs are named after 12 of the [constellations](../../../../general/constellation.md) touching the [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md). Note that the time of the signs do not correspond with the positions of the constellations in general.
- [solar time](../../../../general/solar%20time.md) ::: Similar to the "time" we are familiar with. It is based on the [position of the Sun](../../../../general/position%20of%20the%20Sun.md) in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md).
  - [solar day](../../../../general/synodic%20day.md) ::: About 24 hours for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). Similar to the "day" we are familiar with. The time between two occurrences of the same [position of the Sun](../../../../general/position%20of%20the%20Sun.md) in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md).
- [sidereal time](../../../../general/sidereal%20time.md) ::: Not the "time" we are familiar with. It is based on the positions of the [fixed stars](../../../../general/fixed%20stars.md).
  - sidereal day ::: About 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). Not the "day" we are familiar with. The time it takes for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) to rotate 360° around its own axis. Usually uses the positions of [fixed stars](../../../../general/fixed%20stars.md) as reference.
    - implications of the sidereal day being shorter than solar day for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::: Every (solar) day, stars appear in the same position in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md) almost 3 minutes 56 seconds earlier.
  - [§ comparison to solar time](../../../../general/sidereal%20time.md#comparison%20to%20solar%20time) ::: Solar day and sidereal day lengths are different. For most planets, which are in [prograde motion](../../../../general/retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) (the [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) spins in the same direction as its orbital direction), the solar day is longer than the sidereal day. Consider a planet and a point on the planet initially facing its parent star. Consider after it has spined 360°, corresponding to a sidereal day. In that time, the planet has progressed in the orbit as well, thus the direction of the parent star has also advanced in the spinning direction. So more time is needed for the point to "catch up" so that it faces the parent star again. Thus, a solar day is longer than the sidereal day. Uncommonly, if the motion is retrograde instead, then reverse the above argument to get the conclusion that a solar day is shorter than a sidereal day.
  - [§ sidereal days compared to solar days on other planets](../../../../general/sidereal%20time.md#sidereal%20days%20compared%20to%20solar%20days%20on%20other%20planets) ::: For [prograde motion](../../../../general/retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) (the [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) spins in the same direction as its orbital direction, which is true for most planets), the formula is $$\text{number of solar days per orbital period} = \text{number of sidereal days per orbital period} - 1$$. For retrograde motion, the formula is $$\text{number of solar days per orbital period} = \text{number of sidereal days per orbital period} + 1$$. The length formulas can easily be derived from above.
- [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md)
  - [axial parallelism](../../../../general/axial%20parallelism.md) ::: Ignoring [axial precession](../../../../general/axial%20precession.md) (which are long-term minor variations in the [rotation axis](../../../../general/rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md)), [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s [rotation axis](../../../../general/rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md) remains fixed. That is, the [North Pole](../../../../general/North%20Pole.md) always point to the [Polaris](../../../../general/Polaris.md).
  - [§ seasons](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md#seasons)
- [season](../../../../general/season.md)
  - [§ axial parallelism](../../../../general/season.md#axial%20parallelism)
  - [§ axial tilt](../../../../general/season.md#axial%20tilt)
  - season [§ elliptical Earth orbit](../../../../general/season.md#elliptical%20Earth%20orbit) ::: The [Earth orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md) being elliptical does not affect the seasons much. As the Earth's [orbital distance](../../../../general/semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes.md) varies by about 3%, sunlight received varies by only about 7%. (In fact, the Earth is farther away in the [summer](../../../../general/summer.md) for the [Northern Hemisphere](../../../../general/Northern%20Hemisphere.md).) For the same reason, some parts of the [Earth's surface](geoid.md) being closer or farther (but not angle of the surface) due to [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) also does not contribute much, considering the distance difference—up to only thousands of [kilometers](../../../../general/kilometre.md)—is even smaller. Both effects are overwhelmed by the effect of axial parallelism and axial tilt.
- [surface power density](../../../../general/surface%20power%20density.md) ::: [power](../../../../general/power%20(physics).md) per unit [area](../../../../general/area.md), e.g. [solar irradiance](../../../../general/solar%20irradiance.md)
  - [solar irradiance](../../../../general/solar%20irradiance.md), solar flux ::: The [power](../../../../general/power%20(physics).md) per unit [area](../../../../general/area.md) ([surface power density](../../../../general/surface%20power%20density.md)) received from the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), typically measured in [watts](../../../../general/watt.md) per [square meter](../../../../general/square%20metre.md) (W/m<sup>2</sup>) in [SI units](../../../../general/International%20System%20of%20Units.md).
    - [solar flux](../../../../general/solar%20irradiance.md) & [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) ::: [Axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) makes the [sunlight](../../../../general/sunlight.md) not necessarily hit the surface [perpendicularly](../../../../general/perpendicular.md). When it is not perpendicular, the same amount of sunlight is spread over a larger surface area. This effect can be approximated as: $$\text{solar flux} = \text{solar power} \cdot \cos \theta$$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the [normal](../../../../general/normal%20(geometry).md) of the surface and the direction of solar radiation.
- [analemma](../../../../general/analemma.md)
  - [analemma](../../../../general/analemma.md) & [season](../../../../general/season.md) ::: The [analemma](../../../../general/analemma.md) at [noon](../../../../general/noon.md) shows the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)'s altitude on the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) at noon in any particular day of the year. Higher altitude means the [sunlight](../../../../general/sunlight.md) is more direct, so it is [summer](../../../../general/summer.md). Conversely, lower altitude means the sunlight is less direct, so it is [winter](../../../../general/winter.md).
  - analemma direction ::: The Sun moves eastward on the analemma near the solstices (the top and bottom of the 8 figure).

- [equinox](../../../../general/equinox.md) ::: Axis tilt is sideways with regards to the Sun. The Sun on the celestial equator on the celestial sphere. Both hemisphere receives the same amount of sunlight.
  - equinox etymology ::: equi "equal" + nox "night"
  - equinox names ::: spring/vernal equinox, fall/autumnal equinox, March equinox, September equinox
    - spring/vernal equinox, fall/autumnal equinox vs. [March equinox](../../../../general/March%20equinox.md), [September equinox](../../../../general/September%20equinox.md) ::: The former depends on the hemisphere while the latter does not. For the Northern hemisphere, spring/vernal equinox is March equinox and fall/autumnal equinox is September equinox. This is reversed for the Southern hemisphere.
  - March equinox date ::: March 21/22@UT+08 (19–21@UT)
  - September equinox date ::: September 22/23@UT+08 (21–24@UT)
- [solstice](../../../../general/solstice.md) ::: Axis tilt is at the largest angle with regards to the Sun. The Sun is farthest away from the celestial equator on the celestial sphere. One hemisphere receives more sunlight than the other.
  - solstice etymology ::: sol "sun" + stice "stopped", "stationary"
  - solstice names ::: summer solstice, winter solstice, June solstice, December solstice
    - [summer solstice](../../../../general/summer%20solstice.md), [winter solstice](../../../../winter%20solstice.md) vs. [June solstice](../../../../general/June%20solstice.md), [December solstice](../../../../general/December%20solstice.md) ::: The former depends on the hemisphere while the latter does not. For the Northern hemisphere, summer solstice is June solstice and winter solstice is December solstice. This is reversed for the Southern hemisphere.
  - June solstice date ::: June 21/22@UT+08 (20–22@UT)
  - December solstice date ::: December 21/22@UT+08 (20–22@UT)
- [sun path](../../../../general/sun%20path.md) ::: Identify today's Sun position on the ecliptic. Then draw a circle passing through that position and parallel to the celestial equator. This is the path the Sun (roughly) takes on that day. According to the ecliptic, the Sun position oscillates around the celestial equator _over a year_. Then one can see how the path the Sun takes _over a day_ oscillates over a year. By this, one can also see how altitude of the Sun and daytime length change.
  - sun path at polar regions ::: On some days, the circle over a day does not go below or above the horizon.
  - sun path at tropics ::: The Sun is not at the highest altitude on the celestial sphere for both solstices, unlike locations at temperate latitudes. On the equator, the Sun is at the highest altitude during the equinoxes instead.
- [Tropic of Cancer](../../../../general/Tropic%20of%20Cancer.md) ::: Currently 23°26′10.0″ (or 23.43611°) north of the equator.
  - [Tropic of Cancer § name](../../../../general/Tropic%20of%20Cancer.md#name) ::: It was named after the constellation Cancer during last centuries BCE, as the Sun was there on the June solstice. Due to westward precession of the equinoxes, this is no longer the case. The current constellation is Gemini.
- [Tropic of Capricorn](../../../../general/Tropic%20of%20Capricorn.md) ::: Currently 23°26′10.0″ (or 23.43611°) south of the equator.
  - [Tropic of Capricorn § name](../../../../general/Tropic%20of%20Capricorn.md#name) ::: It was named after the constellation Capricorn during last centuries BCE, as the Sun was there on the December solstice. Due to westward precession of the equinoxes, this is no longer the case. The current constellation is Sagittarius.
- [Arctic Circle](../../../../general/Arctic%20Circle.md) ::: About 66°33′50.0″ north of the equator. The southernmost altitude at which the Sun does not set for at least 24 continuous hours per year.
- [Antarctic Circle](../../../../general/Antarctic%20Circle.md) ::: About 66°33′50.0″ south of the equator. The northernmost altitude at which the Sun does not set for at least 24 continuous hours per year.
- 4 [seasons](season.md) as we know it ::: The 4 seasons as we know it only happen at temperate latitudes. For tropics (latitudes in between the tropics), the seasons become the _dry season_ and the _wet season_, or may not exist at all like in alpines and deserts. For polar regions (latitudes in the Arctic or Antarctic Circle), the sun does not set on some days during the "summer", and does not rise for some days during the "winter". This is apparent when considering the sun path oscillation, restricted to the visible parts of the celestial sphere.
- [axial precession](../../../../general/axial%20precession.md) ::: The orientation of Earth's axis of rotation gradually shifts westward (opposite of the Earth's direction of rotation) in a circle over a period of about 26&nbsp;000 years.
  - axial precession effects ::: One effect is that the celestial poles points at a different direction, changing the pole stars (e.g. the north star will eventually no longer be Polaris). The other is that the constellations the Sun's projection is on during the equinoxes and solstices shifts westward along the zodiac.
- [solar term](../../../../general/solar%20term.md) ::: One of the 24 periods in traditional Chinese lunisolar calendars.
- [scale of the universe @ HKUST](scale%20of%20the%20universe%20@%20HKUST.md) / [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md)
- [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md)
  - [§ orbit](../../../../general/Moon.md#orbit)
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / [average orbital distance](../../../../general/lunar%20distance.md) ::: 384&nbsp;400 km, about 30 times the diameter of Earth
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / orbital direction ::: counterclockwise viewed from north; prograde to Earth's rotation direction
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / rotation direction ::: counterclockwise viewed from north; prograde to its own rotation direction, prograde to Earth's rotation direction
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / synodic [orbital period](../../../../general/orbital%20period.md) (with respect to [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)) ::: about 29.5 days
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / synodic [rotation period](../../../../general/rotation%20period%20(astronomy).md) (with respect to the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)) ::: about 29.5 days = synodic orbital period (due to tidal locking)
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / [tidal locking](../../../../general/tidal%20locking.md) (misnomer: synchronous orbit) ::: The orbital period equals the rotation period. That means the same near side is always exposed to the Earth. The far side is also called the "dark side of the Moon".
  - [lunar phase](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md) ::: Cycles once every lunar month, which is about 29.5 days, which is the same as the synodic rotation period. Caused by changing relative orbital positions of the Moon, Earth, and the Sun, as the Moon orbits around Earth and Earth orbits around the Sun. Half of the Moon is always sunlit (the side facing the Sun), but as the visible side (the side facing the Earth) shifts relative to the sunlit side, so the portion of visible side that is sunlit changes.
    - [lunar phase § principal and intermediate phases of the Moon](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md#principal%20and%20intermediate%20phases%20of%20the%20Moon) ::: new moon -> waxing crescent -> first quarter -> waxing gibbous -> full moon -> waning gibbous -> third quarter -> waning crescent -> (new moon)
      - [lunar phase § principal and intermediate phases of the Moon](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md#principal%20and%20intermediate%20phases%20of%20the%20Moon) / memorization ::: New moon and full moon are easily remembered. Then insert the 2 quarters, first quarter and third quarter, respectively in between new moon and full moon, and in between full moon and next new moon. Finally, in between each of the 4 phases, including between third quarter and next new moon, insert the 4 minor phases. The 4 minor phases is a word combination of waxing or waning, and crescent or gibbous. Waxing means "increasing" while waning means "decreasing". Crescent means "sickle moon" while gibbous means "convex" or "protuberant", so the former is thinner than the latter.
    - [lunar phase](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md) / moonrise and moonset ::: Each day, the Moon advances in its orbit slightly, delaying moonrise and moonset daily by about 50 minutes. The moonrise and moonset times correspond to the moon phases, and resets every lunar month.
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / sidereal [orbital period](../../../../general/orbital%20period.md) ::: about 27.3 days
  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / sidereal [rotation period](../../../../general/rotation%20period%20(astronomy).md) ::: about 27.3 days = sidereal orbital period (due to tidal locking)
- [orbital period § synodic period](../../../../general/orbital%20period.md#synodic%20period) ::: It is the orbital period of a body orbiting a second body, using a third body as the reference. (The second body and the third body can be the same.) It is also the time between [conjunctions](conjunction%20(astronomy).md) of the second body and the third body as viewed from the first body. For observers on [Earth](Earth.md), the usual reference (third body) is the [Sun](Sun.md).
  - [orbital period § synodic period](../../../../general/orbital%20period.md#synodic%20period) / calculation ::: For 2 bodies orbiting in the same direction, $$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} - \frac 1 {T_2} \qquad T_1 < T_2$$. For 2 bodies orbiting in opposing direction, $$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} + \frac 1 {T_2}$$.

- [diurnal motion](../../../../general/diurnal%20motion.md) ::: The Sun, the Moon, and planets move westward due to Earth's rotation.
- [apparent retrograde motion](../../../../general/apparent%20retrograde%20motion.md)
  - [§ from Earth](../../../../general/apparent%20retrograde%20motion.md#from%20Earth)
  - explaining apparent retrograde motion ::: The inner planet moves faster than the outer planet when they are near conjunctions, so the relative velocity reverses and apparent retrograde motion occurs.
    - explaining apparent retrograde motion in ancient times ::: As most ancients thought that Earth is the center, it was harder to explain. Their explanation was using deferents and epicycles.
- [stellar parallax](../../../../general/stellar%20parallax.md)
- reason the (very) ancient Greeks thought Earth is the center ::: They cannot observe stellar parallax of the fixed stars. There were 2 plausible explanations for them. One was the fixed stars are too far away so the stellar parallax is too small to be observed with the naked eye. The other was Earth is the center of the universe. With rare exceptions, the first (and correct) option was rejected by most (very) ancient Greeks because they could not believe that fixed stars are _that_ far away.
  - reason the (very) ancient Greeks thought Earth is the center / exceptions ::: (very) ancient Greeks who thought the fixed stars are indeed _that_ far away: Aristarchus, etc.
- scientific thinking ::: based on everyday ideas arising from observations and trial-and-error experiments
- [astronomy](../../../../general/astronomy.md) ::: oldest science, as many ancient cultures throughout the world practiced it by making observations of the sky and noticing patterns of cyclic motions

- [Earth's circumference](../../../../general/Earth's%20circumference.md) ::: around the equator: 40&nbsp;075.017 km, passing through the poles: 40&nbsp;007.863 km
  - [§ Eratosthenes](../../../../general/Earth's%20circumference.md#Eratosthenes)
    - [Earth's circumference § Eratosthenes](../../../../general/Earth's%20circumference.md#Eratosthenes) / measurements ::: Alexandria and Syene are about 5000 stadia away. The direction of Sun's rays is about 7.2°.
    - [Earth's circumference § Eratosthenes](../../../../general/Earth's%20circumference.md#Eratosthenes) / calculation ::: estimated distance = 5000 * 360° / 7.2° = 25&nbsp;000 stadia, which is about 42&nbsp;000 km
  - [§ Greece: spherical Earth](../../../../general/flat%20Earth.md#Greece%20spherical%20Earth)
- [geocentric model](../../../../general/geocentric%20model.md)
  - [§ Ptolemaic model](../../../../general/geocentric%20model.md#Ptolemaic%20model)
  - [§ Ptolemaic system](../../../../general/geocentric%20model.md#Ptolemaic%20system)
  - Why had the geocentric model persisted for about 1500 years? ::: It was the best model until the appearance of the heliocentric model described by Kepler in 1624.
  - How was the geocentric model challenged? ::: Aristarchus of Samos had the idea a very long time ago, but it was the ancient Greek times. The actual challenge started with Nicolaus Copernicus also having the idea. Then Tycho Brahe collected astronomical data. Finally, the data was interpreted by Johannes Kepler and developed his 3 laws of planetary motion to explain the data.
- [Copernican heliocentrism](../../../../general/Copernican%20heliocentrism.md)
  - [§ Copernican theory](../../../../general/Copernican%20heliocentrism.md#Copernican%20theory)
  - Why do we not need the motion of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) even if it is moving quickly? ::: Because we feel acceleration, not motion. It turns out Earth's acceleration (about 0.0059 m/s<sup>2</sup>) is too little to notice.
- [Tycho Brahe](../../../../general/Tycho%20Brahe.md) ::: A Danish astronomer known for his comprehensive and unprecedentedly accurate astronomical observations (...with the naked eye! As telescopes were not invented yet...). His observations, particularly Mars, disagreed with predictions of the existing perfect heliocentric model.
- [Johannes Kepler](../../../../general/Johannes%20Kepler.md) ::: He did not ignore small discrepancies between the data and predictions of existing models, and finally came up with elliptical orbits.
- [ellipse](../../../../general/ellipse.md)
- [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](../../../../general/Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md)
  - 2nd Kepler's law implications ::: Planets travel faster when they are closer to the Sun.
  - [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](../../../../general/Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) / the physics behind ::: The physics behind is [Newton's laws of motion](Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md), proposed about 60 years later.
- [apsis](../../../../general/apsis.md) :::  farthest: aphelion, nearest: perihelion
- [Galileo Galilei](../../../../general/Galileo%20Galilei.md) ::: He overcame 3 key objections rooted in the Aristotelian view: Earth could not be moving as objects would be left behind, non-circular orbits are not "perfect" as the heavens should be, and stellar parallax should have been detected. He also provided 2 key observations using the newly invented telescope.
  - countering "Earth could not be moving as objects would be left behind" ::: Aristotle's belief that all objects naturally come to rest is wrong. Moving objects stay in motion unless an external force acts to slow them down (Newton's laws of motion). Further, we do not feel motion, just as we do not feel a ship is moving or a rest when sitting inside a cabin, so that there are no visual clues that tells us the conditions of the ship (equivalence principle).
  - countering "non-circular orbits are not 'perfect' as the heavens should be" ::: Tycho's observations of comets and sueprnovas demonstrated the heavens are imperfect. Galileo also observed sunspots on the Sun (the Sun is imperfect), and mountains and valleys on the Moon (the Moon is not a perfect sphere).
  - countering "stellar parallax should have been detected" ::: Tycho thought his naked-eye observations should detect stellar parallax for distances he thought the stars were located at. Galileo showed that the stars are even farther away than Tycho thought, so not detecting stellar parallax is okay. He observed that the Milky Way has many stars using his telescope, partially demonstrating the stars' extreme distances.
  - [Galilean Moons](../../../../general/Galilean%20Moons.md) ::: They are the four largest moons of Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Galileo observed the moons and reasoned that the Moon can orbit Earth instead of the Sun, just as there are moons orbiting Jupiter.
  - [phases of Venus](../../../../general/phases%20of%20Venus.md) ::: They are the variations of lighting seen on the planet's surface, similar to lunar phases. Galileo observed a full set of phases. However, according to the Ptolemaic model, Venus can only show a crescent phase as Venus is always in between Earth and the Sun. This is better explained by a heilocentric model.
  - angular size of Venus ::: The change in angular size of Venus (about 10 to 58 arcseconds) is too extreme to be explained by the Ptolemaic model but easily explained by a heliocentric model.
- [speed](../../../../general/speed.md) ::: rate at which the object moves, without considering direction, usually in m/s
- [velocity](../../../../general/velocity.md) ::: magnitude (speed) and direction at which the objects move, usually in m/s and labelled a direction (e.g. east)
- [acceleration](../../../../general/acceleration.md) ::: rate of change of magnitude and direction in velocity, usually in m/s<sup>2</sup> and labelled a direction (e.g. east)
  - [gravity of Earth](../../../../general/gravity%20of%20Earth.md) ::: An example of acceleration. All falling objects, regardless of their masses, on Earth accelerate at $g \approx 9.81\text{ m/s}^2 \approx 10\text{ m/s}^2$; that is, the speed increases by $g$ per second of falling. Note that this neglects the effect of air resistance. (See the demonstration of a feather and hammer falling on the Moon during the Apollo 15 mission, which has no atmospheres.)
- [classical element](../../../../general/classical%20element.md)
  - [§ Aristotle](../../../../general/classical%20element.md#Aristotle) ::: 5 elements: earth, water, air, fire, quintessence (heavenly element)
    - [classical element § Aristotle](../../../../general/classical%20element.md#Aristotle) / classical element properties ::: Earth is _naturally_ the center of the universe. Then other elements, in the order of (earth, then) water, air, and fire, _naturally_ surrounds it in multiple layers of circles. Heavenly element is not surrounded by a circle, as it is the outermost element. The first 4 elements are earthy elements, which returns to their _natural_ positions _naturally_. Quintessence performs perpetual circular motion. That means earthly objects would _naturally_ come to rest without any force applied.
  - [classical element § Aristotle](../../../../general/classical%20element.md#Aristotle) / motion properties ::: There exists a natural state of "no motion", being at rest. At rest is special because all earthy elements eventually come to rest. Thus, at rest and moving can be distinguished. People should be able to notice whether they are at rest or moving. Particularly, Earth is at rest in the geocentric model.
  - [§ aether](../../../../general/classical%20element.md#aether)
- [Galilean invariance](../../../../general/Galilean%20invariance.md) ::: The laws of motion are the same in all inertial frames of reference.
  - [inertial frame of reference](../../../../general/inertial%20frame%20of%20reference.md) ::: The view of other objects of an observer that is not undergoing acceleration.
    - Why do we feel acceleration but not uniform motion? ::: If we can feel uniform motion, that means we can distinguish undergoing uniform motion versus being at rest. Yet both frames of references are inertial as there is no acceleration, which by Galilean invariance, should not be distinguishable. So we cannot feel uniform motion. But acceleration can be felt as the frame of reference is no longer inertial.
  - [Galileo's ship § 1632 thought experiment](../../../../general/Galileo's%20ship.md#1632%20thought%20experiment) ::: In short: You are in a cabin of a ship, without any windows (cannot look at the outside world). There are many things going on in the cabin. Imagine two scenarios: the ship is not moving, and the ship is moving in uniform motion (no acceleration). In both scenarios, you observe things going on in the cabin. You would see everything goes on the same way whether the ship is moving or not. Therefore, there is no way to distinguish between uniform motion or being at rest without looking outside. Being in uniform motion is undetectable.
- [friction](../../../../general/friction.md)
  - Why do things come to rest spontaneously in our everyday lives? ::: It is due to friction. It is the force resisting relative lateral motion of contact surfaces of two objects. The origin of friction is the microscopic interactions of particles between the two surfaces.
  - How to make things move longer? ::: If friction is reduced, objects can move for a longer time, such as using an air cushion. If it is eliminated, objects can move forever, but we do not have perfectly frictionless surface in our everyday lives.
  - [friction](../../../../general/friction.md) / Galileo's thought experiment ::: Assume there is a ball moving on a perfectly frictionless track. Say the track goes down and then up. The ball will go up to the original height if the track goes back up high enough. If the track does not go back high enough, then it will roll forever.

- time: 2024-07-11T10:00:00+08:00/2024-07-11T12:30:00+08:00
- [Issac Newton](../../../../general/Issac%20Newton.md) (1642–1727) ::: He is famous for his three laws of motions, law of universal gravitation, invention of calculus, optics, reflecting telescopes, etc.
  - Newton's laws of motion + law of universal gravitation ::: They can account for (almost; see Einstein's theories) everything about astronomical-scale objects.
- [Newton's laws of motion](../../../../general/Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md)
  - [Newton's laws of motion § first law](../../../../general/Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md#first%20law) ::: An object either remains at rest or in motion at constant velocity unless a net force acts on it to change its speed and/or direction of motion.
    - [Newton's laws of motion § first law](../../../../general/Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md#first%20law) / examples ::: Free falling is experienced for a spacecraft and its content orbiting Earth. In that situation, the first law can be easily observed.
  - [Newton's laws of motion § second law](../../../../general/Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md#second%20law) ::: force = mass * acceleration: $$\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$$
  - [Newton's laws of motion § third law](../../../../general/Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md#third%20law) ::: For every force acting on B by A, there is always an equal and opposite reaction force acting on A by B.
    - [Newton's laws of motion § third law](../../../../general/Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md#third%20law) / examples ::: When launching a rocket, the rocket pushes (ejects) a large amount of mass downward, so the large amount of mass pushes the rocket upward by the third law.
  - How has Newton's laws of motion changed our view of the universe? ::: He realized that physical laws are the same regardless if they happen on Earth or in space. Before Newton, orbital mechanics (Kepler's laws of planetary motion) and terrestrial mechanics (constant acceleration towards Earth, principle of inertia) seemed to be two separate mechanics. After Newton, we realized they are actually based on the same laws of physics. An example is circular orbit.
- [circular orbit](../../../../general/circular%20orbit.md)
  - [§ circular acceleration](../../../../general/circular%20orbit.md#circular%20acceleration) ::: centripetal acceleration: objects in circular motion are accelerating towards the center of the circle
  - [circular orbit § velocity](../../../../general/circular%20orbit.md#velocity) ::: the speed required to maintain a circular orbit at a certain distance from the center of the primary body (ignoring friction): $$v = \sqrt{\frac {GM} r}$$
    - [circular orbit § velocity](../../../../general/circular%20orbit.md#velocity) / [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s [surface](../../../../general/geoid.md) ::: about 7.9 km/s at sea level (ignoring air resistance, friction, and obstacles)
  - Why do we not talk about elliptic orbits here? ::: Because mathematically describing the orbit is too mathematically involved for a common core course.
- [Newton's law of universal gravitation](../../../../general/Newton's%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation.md)
  - [Newton's law of universal gravitation](../../../../general/Newton's%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation.md) / mathematical statement ::: $$F = \frac {GMm} {r^2}$$, where $M$ and $m$ are masses of two objects, with $r$ being the distance between their centers of mass.
  - [Newton's law of universal gravitation](../../../../general/Newton's%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation.md) / proportionality ::: The gravitational force is proportional to both masses of two objects, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers of mass.
  - [Newton's law of universal gravitation](../../../../general/Newton's%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation.md)
- [unification of theories in physics § unification of gravity and astronomy](../../../../general/unification%20of%20theories%20in%20physics.md)
  - [unification of theories in physics § unification of gravity and astronomy](../../../../general/unification%20of%20theories%20in%20physics.md) / examples ::: Take circular orbits. It turns out celestial objects perform circular orbits due to gravitational force, the same force responsible for making everyday things fall down to the ground. In fact, we can equate the equations to solve for the centripetal acceleration $a$: $$a = F / m = GMm / {mr^2} = GM / r^2 = g$$, which is the same as the [gravitational acceleration](../../../../general/gravitational%20acceleration.md).
- [Kepler orbit](../../../../general/Kepler%20orbit.md) ::: In increasing energy: circle, ellipsis, parabola, hyperbola. The former two are bounded, meaning orbiting objects return to the same position periodically. The latter two are unbounded, meaning the object does not return, and has nonnegative velocity at infinitely far away. Parabola is the boundary between bounded and unbounded orbits, where the object has exactly zero velocity at infinitely far away, and always equals the escape velocity at every point of its trajectory.
- [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](../../../../general/Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) / third law
  - [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](../../../../general/Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) / third law / mathematical statement ::: $$T^2 = \frac {4\pi^2} {G(M + m)} a^3$$, where $T$ is the orbital period, $a$ is the semi-major axis, $M$ and $m$ are the two objects, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.
  - [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](../../../../general/Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) / third law / derivation for a special case ::: In the special case of a circular orbit ($a = r$) and the mass of the orbiting object $m$ is negligible ($m \ll M$): $$\frac {GMm} {r^2} = m \omega^2 r \implies GM = \omega^2 r^3 \implies GM = r^3 \left(\frac {2\pi} T \right)^2 \implies GM T^2 = 4\pi^2 r^3 \implies T^2 = \frac {4\pi^2} {GM} r^3$$
  - [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](../../../../general/Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) / third law / applications ::: Finding the mass of the primary body from the orbital period and semi-major axis of the orbiting body, assuming the primary body is much more massive than the orbiting body.
- [mass](../../../../general/mass.md) ::: There are multiple definitions, different conceptually but physically equivalent. Traditionally, it was believed to be the quantity of matter. The SI unit is kg.
- [weight](../../../../general/weight.md) ::: It is simply the force acting on the object due to acceleration of gravity. Nothing in the definition relates to mass or quantity of matter.
- [apparent weight](../../../../general/apparent%20weight.md) ::: It is how heavy an object _appears_ to be. Most of the time, this is the ground reaction force. When one is stationary, then the force of gravity are balanced by the ground reaction force, so apparent weight equals weight. However, they are different whenever the force of gravity is not balanced by the reaction force, such as in an accelerating lift, or free falling.
  - [apparent weight](../../../../general/apparent%20weight.md) / [weightlessness](../../../../general/weightlessness.md) examples ::: This also means a "weightless" astronaut in low Earth orbit has an apparent weight of zero (the astronaut is free falling), but has almost the same weight as he would have while standing on the ground. Another daily life example is an accelerating lift. The lift accelerating upwards makes you feel heavier, and vice versa. If the lift accelerates downward at the same rate as the gravitational acceleration, then you are free falling and would feel "weightless", like the astronaut example just now.
- [momentum](../../../../general/momentum.md) ::: $$\mathbf p = m \mathbf v$$, where $\mathbf p$ is the momentum, $m$ is the mass, and $v$ is the velocity.
  - momentum & force ::: For an object of fixed mass $m$, net force is also the change in momentum with respect to time: $$\frac {\mathrm d \mathbf p} {\mathrm dt} = m \frac {\mathrm d \mathbf v} {\mathrm dt} = m \mathbf a = \mathbf F$$.
  - [momentum § conservation](../../../../general/momentum.md#conservation) ::: In a closed system (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces), the total momentum (by summing up the momentum of each object over all objects) remains constant. No matter how complex the interactions internal to the closed system are, this law holds.
  - [momentum](../../../../general/momentum.md) / rotational analog ::: Its rotation analog is [angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md), which is also [conserved](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md#conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum) in a closed system.
- [angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md) ::: $$\mathbf L = \mathbf r \times \mathbf p = m \cdot \mathbf r \times \mathbf v$$, where $\mathbf L$ is the angular momentum, $\mathbf r$ is the position vector, $\mathbf p$ is the momentum, $m$ is the mass, $\mathbf v$ is the velocity.
  - [angular momentum § conservation of angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md#conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum) ::: In a closed system (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces), letting a position as the origin, the total angular momentum (by summing up the angular momentum of each object over all objects) remains constant. No matter how complex the interactions internal to the closed system are, this law holds.
    - [angular momentum § conservation of angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md#conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum) / examples ::: Like how force is the change in linear momentum, torque (twisting force) is the change in angular momentum. A force perpendicular to the line joining the center and the object produces torque, whereas one parallel does not. In a circular or elliptical orbit, with the primary body as center, as the gravitational force always point to the center, so it is always parallel to the line joining the center and the object. No torque is produced, and thus the angular momentum is conserved. Intuitively, the increase or decrease in orbital velocity is counteracted by the decrease or increase in the distance to the primary body, conserving angular momentum. Another example is that ice-skaters spin faster when they retract their hands, which works by the same intuition.
- [energy](../../../../general/energy.md) ::: The quantitative property transferred to a body or system, recognizable as work, heat, light, etc. Its SI units is joules (J). Energy is also conserved.
  - [conservation of energy](../../../../general/conservation%20of%20energy.md) ::: The total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time. But energy can be transferred from one object to another object, both in the isolated system. It can also change in form.
  - [energy § forms](../../../../general/energy.md#forms) / examples ::: kinetic: energy of motion; potential: stored energy, chemically, gravitationally, etc.; radiative: energy of light
- [thermal energy](../../../../general/thermal%20energy.md) ::: A measure of total kinetic and potential energy of all particles in a substance. Therefore, it depends on both the temperature, the measure of average kinetic energy, and density of the substance. That means something having a higher temperature than the other thing does not imply its thermal energy is higher.
  - [temperature](../../../../general/temperature.md) ::: A physical quantity describing hotness and coldness. Elementarily, temperature can be thought of as the average kinetic energy of particles. Its units are usually degree Celsius (°C) and and Kelvin (K). Kelvin is often used in physics as temperature in said unit is proportional to the average kinetic energy.
    - [temperature](../../../../general/temperature.md) / [conversion](../../../../general/conversion%20of%20scales%20of%20temperature.md) between [Celsius](../../../../general/Celsius.md) and [Kelvin](../../../../general/Kelvin.md) ::: from Celsius to Kelvin: x °C ≘ (x + 273.15) K, from Kelvin to Celsius: x K ≘ (x − 273.15) °C
- [gravitational energy](../../../../general/gravitational%20energy.md)
  - [gravitational energy § formulation](../../../../general/gravitational%20energy.md#formulation) ::: Close to Earth's surface, the gravitational energy is: $$U = mgh$$, where $U$ is the gravitational energy, $m$ is the mass, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $h$ is how fall an object could potentially fall.
- energy transformation of a contracting gas cloud ::: A contracting gas cloud (e.g. star formation) converts gravitational energy to thermal energy. Since the gas cloud can be very big, so the cloud can originally have huge amounts of gravitational energy, which when converted to thermal energy, makes the cloud very hot. This is one of the mechanisms responsible for star formation.
- [mass–energy equivalence](../../../../general/mass–energy%20equivalence.md)
  - [mass–energy equivalence](../../../../general/mass–energy%20equivalence.md) / implications ::: A small amount of mass can release huge amounts of energy (e.g. nuclear bombs, nuclear reactors). Concentrated energy can also turn into mass (e.g. particle accelerators).

## week 5 lecture

- time: 2024-07-16T10:00:00+08:00/2024-07-16T12:30:00+08:00
- [mechanical energy § satellite](../../../../general/mechanical%20energy.md#satellite) ::: The mechanical energy (total orbital energy), that is the sum of kinetic and potential energy, stays constant. It explains why an orbiting body, given no external energy transfer, being closer to the primary body implies higher velocity, and vice versa.
  - changing an [orbit](../../../../general/orbit.md) ::: External energy will need to be given or taken away from the mechanical energy, which is constant otherwise, to change the orbit. For example, atmospheric or friction drag, and gravitational encounter can change the mechanical energy, thus the orbit.
- [escape velocity](../../../../general/escape%20velocity.md) ::: the minimum speed required to escape into an unbounded orbit at a certain distance from the center of the primary body (ignoring friction): $$v_{\text{escape} } = \sqrt{\frac {2GM} r}$$
  - [escape velocity](../../../../general/escape%20velocity.md) / [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s [surface](../../../../general/geoid.md) ::: about 11.2 km/s at sea level
- [tide](../../../../general/tide.md) ::: periodic variation in sea level, with two tides per day
  - [tide](../../../../general/tide.md) / amplitude ::: Usually in the order of 10 cm to 100 cm. The world's largest tidal range of 17 m (56 ft) occurs at in the Bay of Fundy, Eastern Canada.
  - [tide](../../../../general/tide.md) / contributions ::: tidal force of the Moon, and the tidal force of the Sun, which is about one third as strong as that of the Moon
  - [tidal force](../../../../general/tidal%20force.md) ::: a gravitational effect that stretches an object along the line towards and away from the center of mass of the other object due to spatial variations in the gravitational field strength; a _differential force_
    - [tidal force § explanation](../../../../general/tidal%20force.md#explanation) ::: Consider a sphere falling onto Earth. Consider 5 points of the sphere: its center of mass, the point farthest away from Earth, the point nearest to Earth, and the 2 points on the sideways. The gravitational accelerations of those 5 points are: downward, downward but weaker, downward but stronger, and downward but slightly sideways towards the center. Now, place ourself in the center-of-mass frame, and compute the relative accelerations of the above 5 points by subtracting the acceleration of the center of mass. Then, the relative accelerations of the above 5 points are: zero, upward, downward, and sideways approximately towards the center. These are the tidal forces. It is also clear why this is a _differential force_.
    - [spaghettification](../../../../general/spaghettification.md), noodle effect ::: When the tidal forces are extreme enough, such as near a black hole, objects can become long thin shapes like spaghetti, hence the name. (For super massive black holes, one needs to well within the event horizon for spaghettification to happen.)
  - [tide § equilibrium](../../../../general/tide.md#equilibrium) ::: Assuming an idealized landless Earth, the ocean would elongate in the direction of the attracting body (Moon or Sun), also known as the __equilibrium tide__. The rotation of Earth does not affect the equilibrium. So each day has about two tides. It does rotate the current tide eastward away from the equilibrium tide, causing the attracting body to pull the tide back to the equilibrium tide (or equivalently by Newton's third law, the current tide pulls the Moon ahead to orbit faster temporarily), responsible for tidal dissipation.
  - [tide § range variation: springs and neaps](../../../../general/tide.md#range%20variation%20springs%20and%20neaps) ::: Highest tides when the Moon is in the new moon or full moon phase, as the tidal forces of the Sun and the Moon reinforce each other. Lowest tides when the Moon is at the first quarter or third quarter phase, as the weaker tidal forces of the Sun partially cancels that of the Moon.
  - [tide § dissipation](../../../../general/tide.md#dissipation) ::: As the actual tide is ahead of the equilibrium, the Moon pulls the actual tide back to the equilibrium, so Earth rotates increasing slowly. Or equivalently by Newton's third law, the actual tide pulls the Moon ahead to orbit faster, so the Moon orbits faster (temporarily; afterwards, the Moon's orbital radius increases, so the Moon's average orbital velocity actually decreases instead). This is known as tidal acceleration.
- [orbit of the Moon](../../../../general/orbit%20of%20the%20Moon.md) / center ::: It turns out the Moon does not simply orbit around Earth. More accurately, they are orbiting each other about their common center of mass called the barycenter, which is 4670 km from Earth's center (about 73% of its radius, so within Earth). This is actually true of any other orbits, because the primary body and the orbiting body are mutually falling into each other.
- [tidal acceleration](../../../../general/tidal%20acceleration.md) ::: Recall that tidal dissipation decelerates Earth's rotation. It also accelerates the Moon temporarily; afterwards, the Moon's orbital radius increases, so the Moon's average orbital velocity actually decreases instead. This can also be explained by conservation of angular momentum: the angular momentum of Earth is transferred to the Moon's orbit.
- [tidal locking](../../../../general/tidal%20locking.md) ::: Assume there are two co-orbiting (orbiting) bodies, _A_ and _B_. _A_ is tidally locked when the rotation rate of _A_ does not change over the course of a complete orbit. The definition is similar for _B_. Alternatively, it may _exclusively_ refer to 1:1 synchronous rotation, where the rotation periods equal the orbital periods, like the Moon right now. We will use the latter definition in this course.
  - [tidal locking](../../../../general/tidal%20locking.md) / [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) ::: Recall that the Moon's orbital period equals its rotation period. That means the Moon is tidally locked to Earth. It has done so within 100 million years. Earth has also slowed down its rotation period from about 6 hours to the current 24 hours over about 4.5 billion years. This is because Earth's mass is larger than the Moon, so it takes longer. Eventually, in about 50 billion years, the Earth's rotation period will slow down enough by tidal dissipation that it becomes tidally locked to the Moon as well. (Though the Sun would have become a red giant and engulf Earth and the Moon way before then.)
- [light](../../../../general/light.md) ::: electromagnetic radiation that can be seen by the human eye
  - [light](../../../../general/light.md) / the cosmic messenger ::: It is a tool for learning about the universe. But there are also electromagnetic radiation that _cannot_ be seen by the human eye, but they are also tools for learning about the universe, though specialized equipment is required to "see" them.
- [electromagnetic radiation](../../../../general/electromagnetic%20radiation.md) ::: waves of the electromagnetic field; a combination of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that are perpendicular to each other and both to the direction of wave motion
  - [§ wave model](../../../../general/electromagnetic%20radiation.md#wave%20model)
  - wave / [frequency](../../../../general/frequency.md) ::: symbol: $f$; number of occurrences per unit of time, usually in Hz or s<sup>-1</sup>; in waves, the number of times the wave peaks (or dips) per unit of time
  - [wavelength](../../../../general/wavelength.md) ::: symbol: $\lambda$; distance over which the wave's shape repeats, also the distance between two adjacent crests, troughs, or zero crossings in the same direction
  - [speed of light](../../../../general/speed%20of%20light.md) ::: symbol: $c$; 299&nbsp;792&nbsp;458 m/s, about 300&nbsp;000 km/s
    - [speed of light](../../../../general/speed%20of%20light.md) / mathematical relation ::: $$c = \lambda f$$
  - [electromagnetic radiation](../../../../general/electromagnetic%20radiation.md) / examples ::: in increasing frequency: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays
  - [photon](../../../../general/photon.md) ::: By the wave–particle duality, electromagnetic radiation sometimes exhibit properties of a particle. The higher energy a photon has, the higher its frequency and the lower its wavelength.
  - [photon energy](../../../../general/photon%20energy.md) ::: $$E = hf = \frac {hc} \lambda$$, where $h$ is the Planck constant
  - [Planck constant](../../../../general/Planck%20constant.md) ::: $h = 6.626\,070\,15 \times 10^{-34}~\mathrm{J \cdot Hz^{-1} }$
    - [Planck constant](../../../../general/Planck%20constant.md) / fundamental mathematical relations ::: $$\begin{aligned} E & = h f \\ \lambda & = \frac h p \end{aligned}$$, where $h$ is the Planck constant
- [matter](../../../../general/matter.md) / composition ::: Ordinary matter are made of atoms.
- [atom](../../../../general/atom.md) ::: a particle consisting of a nucleus of neutrons and protons surrounded by a cloud of electrons
  - [atomic number](../../../../general/atomic%20number.md) ::: for ordinary nuclei, the number of protons
  - [mass number](../../../../general/mass%20number.md) ::: the total number of protons and neutrons
- [isotope](../../../../general/isotope.md) ::: distinct nuclides of the same element, which have have the same atomic number but different mass numbers
- [molecule](../../../../general/molecule.md) ::: a group of multiple atoms held together by chemical bonds
- interactions between [light](../../../../general/light.md) and [matter](../../../../general/matter.md) ::: absorption, emission, reflection, scattering, transmissions, etc.
- [specular reflection](../../../../general/specular%20reflection.md) ::: mirror-like reflection of waves, such as light, from a surface; the law of reflection says the incidence angle and reflection angle are equal; in practice, some waves may be absorbed, reducing intensity
- [scattering](../../../../general/scattering.md) ::: moving particle or radiation deviates from a straight trajectory; in practice, absorption may occur during scattering, reducing intensity
- [astronomical object](../../../../general/astronomical%20object.md) / spectra ::: combinations of continuous spectrum, absorption spectrum, and emission spectrum
- [Gustav Kirchhoff § Kirchhoff's three laws of spectroscopy](../../../../general/Gustav%20Kirchhoff.md#Kirchhoff's%20three%20laws%20of%20spectroscopy)
- [emission spectrum](../../../../general/emission%20spectrum.md) ::: the spectrum of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation emitted due to electrons making a transition from a higher energy state to a lower energy state; specific to a chemical element or chemical compound
- [absorption spectroscopy § absorption spectrum](../../../../general/absorption%20spectroscopy.md#absorption%20spectrum) ::: the fraction of incident radiation absorbed by the material over a range of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation due to electrons making a transition from a lower energy level to a higher energy level; specific to a chemical element or chemical compound
  - [absorption spectroscopy § relation to emission spectrum](../../../../general/absorption%20spectroscopy.md#relation%20to%20emission%20spectrum) ::: Since emission can occur at any frequency at which absorption can occur, it is same as the emission spectrum except for the intensity pattern, which are typically quite different.
- [hydrogen spectral series](../../../../general/hydrogen%20spectral%20series.md) / series ::: first three series: the Lyman series (ultraviolet), Balmer series (visible), and the Paschen series (infrared)
- [spectroscopy](../../../../general/spectroscopy.md)
  - [spectroscopy](../../../../general/spectroscopy.md) / use of spectra ::: Since emission and absorption spectra are specific to a chemical element or chemical compound, we can tell what chemicals are present from the spectra. We can also use the spectrum peak to determine the surface temperature. We can also only look at the visible spectrum to find its color.
  - [spectroscopy](../../../../general/spectroscopy.md) / [photosphere](../../../../general/photosphere.md) ::: The absorption spectrum of a star (e.g. the Sun) is produced by gases in the photosphere (above the surface of the star) of the star. It tells us about the composition of the photosphere and its ionization state.
  [spectroscopy](../../../../general/spectroscopy.md) / examples ::: <https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000815.html> (2000-08-15): The Sun's absorption spectrum in the visible spectrum from 400 to 700 nm, shown in 50 slices (rows) of each 6 nm (60 angstorms). Wavelength increases in a Z order.
- [thermal radiation](../../../../general/thermal%20radiation.md)
  - [thermal radiation](../../../../general/thermal%20radiation.md) / emission conditions ::: all objects with a temperature grater than absolute zero (0&nbsp;K = -273.15&nbsp;°C = -459.67&nbsp;°F) emit it
  - [thermal radiation](../../../../general/thermal%20radiation.md) / emission examples ::: Humans (about 33.5&nbsp;°C to 36.9&nbsp;°C) emits (invisible) infrared, charcoal (about 700&nbsp;°C) emits red, ordinary light bulb (2800&nbsp;K) emits orange, the Sun (5772&nbsp;K) emits white, and the universe (2.7&nbsp;K; a.k.a. cosmic microwave background) emits (invisible) microwaves (duh).
- [Stefan–Boltzmann law](../../../../general/Stefan–Boltzmann%20law.md) ::: $$M = \varepsilon M^\circ = \varepsilon \sigma T^4$$, where $M$ is the radiant exitance, i.e. the total energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time, of a surface with emissivity $\varepsilon$ (assume 1 for this course) at temperature $T$, and $\sigma$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant
  - [Stefan–Boltzmann constant](../../../../general/Stefan–Boltzmann%20law.md) ::: $\sigma = 5.670\,374\,419\ldots \times 10^{-8} ~\mathrm{W \cdot m^{-2} \cdot K^{-4} }$
  - [Stefan–Boltzmann law](../../../../general/Stefan–Boltzmann%20law.md) / implications ::: Hotter objects emit more energy per unit area over all frequencies.
- [Wien approximation](../../../../general/Wien%20approximation.md) ::: a law of physics used to describe the spectrum of thermal radiation
  - [§ details](../../../../general/Wien%20approximation.md#details)
  - [Wien approximation](../../../../general/Wien%20approximation.md) / spectral radiance graph ::: It looks like a hill with somewhat narrow peak.
  - [Wien approximation § peak value](../../../../general/Wien%20approximation.md#peak%20value) (wavelength) ::: $$\lambda_{\text{max} } \approx \frac {2.878 \times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{m \cdot K} } T$$, where $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin
  - [Wien approximation](../../../../general/Wien%20approximation.md) / implications ::: Hotter objects emit more energetic photons, and has shorter wavelength (higher frequency, more energy) at which peak spectral radiance occurs.
- [color temperature](../../../../general/color%20temperature.md) ::: the color emitted from an object of a given surface temperature, as seen by the human eye (assuming the object is an ideal black body)
  - [color temperature](../../../../general/color%20temperature.md) / examples ::: Humans (310&nbsp;K) do not emit visible light. A 3000&nbsp;K star emits orange light. The Sun (5772&nbsp;K) emits white light. A 15&nbsp;000&nbsp;K star emits blue light.
  - [color temperature](../../../../general/color%20temperature.md) / determination from a graph of spectral radiance ::: You are looking at a graph of spectral radiance and you want to determine the color. First, restrict the graph to the visible light region. Then see if any particular frequencies or wavelengths are much higher than other frequencies or wavelengths. If so, the emitted color is approximately the color corresponding to said frequencies or wavelengths. Instead, if it is an approximately even mix across the visible spectrum, then it is likely white, as a white is an even mix of all visible light. This can be explained by that the human eye interprets color relatively.
- [luminosity](../../../../general/luminosity.md) ([astronomy](../../../../general/astronomy.md)), [radiant flux](../../../../general/radiant%20flux.md) ::: It is the amount of energy per time emitted by a light-emitting object.
  - [luminosity](../../../../general/luminosity.md) / mathematical equations in the astronomical context ::: Luckily, most stars take on a spherical shape. So the luminosity ($L$) is simply the radiant exitance ($M_{\mathrm e}$) multiplied by the surface area ($A$) of a sphere: $$L = A M_{\mathrm e} = 4 \pi r^2 M_{\mathrm e}$$, where $r$ is the radius of the star. The radiant exitance can be calculated using the Stefan–Boltzmann law. Combining them, we get $$L = 4 \pi r^2 \varepsilon \sigma T^4$$.
    - [luminosity](../../../../general/luminosity.md) / mathematical equations in the astronomical context / implications ::: Larger stars are more luminous than smaller stars, given they have the same surface temperature. Hotter stars are more luminous than cooler stars, given they have the same size.

- [Doppler effect](../../../../general/Doppler%20effect.md) ::: The wavelength of a wave is changed when source and receiver are moving relatively. Redshift when the relative velocity away from each other. Blueshift when the relative velocity is towards each other.
  - [Doppler effect](../../../../general/Doppler%20effect.md) / visualization ::: Imagine a static wave connecting the source and the receiver. Imagine that the wave is extended or compressed like a spring when they are, respectively, moving away and moving apart.
  - [§ general](../../../../general/Doppler%20effect.md#general)
    - [Doppler effect § general](../../../../general/Doppler%20effect.md#general) / mathematical equation ::: Assuming the speeds of the source and receiver are lower than the wave speed: $$f_r = \left(\frac {c - v_r} {c + v_s}\right) f_s$$, where $f_r$ and $f_s$ are the frequencies at respectively the receiver and source, $c$ is the wave speed, and $v_r$ and $v_s$ are speeds of respectively the receiver and the source, positive when moving away and negative when moving towards.
  - [Doppler effect](../../../../general/Doppler%20effect.md) / mathematical equation (lecture slide) ::: Assuming the speeds of the source and receiver are negligible compared to the wave speed: $$\frac {\Delta \lambda} {\lambda_{\text{rest} } } = \frac {v_r} c$$, where $\Delta \lambda$ is the wavelength difference, and $v_r$ is the radial velocity of the source relative to the receiver, that is positive when moving away and negative when moving towards.
  - [Doppler effect](../../../../general/Doppler%20effect.md) / radial velocity ::: Also called longitudinal velocity. It is the component of the relative velocity that is parallel to a line joining the receiver and the source. The perpendicular component is called the tangential or transverse velocity. This perpendicular component does not affect the effect (in the non-relativistic setting).
  - [Doppler effect](../../../../general/Doppler%20effect.md) / implications for [astronomy](../../../../general/astronomy.md) ::: Spectrum lines are redshifted when moving apart and blueshifted when moving closer. The radial velocity (but not the transverse velocity) can also be calculated from the shift amount.
- [telescope](../../../../general/telescope.md) ::: a device used to observe distant objects
  - [telescope](../../../../general/telescope.md) / the why ::: They can have larger light-collecting area, they can have higher angular resolution, and can detect electromagnetic radiation not in the visible spectrum.
- [optical telescope](../../../../general/optical%20telescope.md)
  - [optical telescope § light-gathering power](../../../../general/optical%20telescope.md#light-gathering%20power) ::: Some stars are faint in the sky. High light-gathering power is needed to see them.
    - [optical telescope § light-gathering power](../../../../general/optical%20telescope.md#light-gathering%20power) / mathematical relations ::: It is proportional to the square of the aperture (diameter of the objective).
  - [optical telescope § angular resolution](../../../../general/optical%20telescope.md#angular%20resolution) ::: Stars are so far away that they occupy a small angular size. High angular resolution (note that "high" is used colloquially, the actual value is low when we say "high" here; this also applies elsewhere) is needed to resolve their details. Angular resolution is defined as the minimum angular separation two objects need to distinguish them.
    - [optical telescope § angular resolution](../../../../general/optical%20telescope.md#angular%20resolution) / mathematical equations ::: $$\alpha \approx \sin \alpha = 1.22 \frac \lambda D$$ (the first approximate quality is accurate when $\alpha$ is small), where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $D$ is the aperture (diameter of the objective).
    - [angular resolution § Rayleigh's criterion](../../../../general/angular%20resolution.md#Rayleigh's%20criterion) ::: two point sources are considered just resolved when the principal diffraction maximum of the Airy disk of an image coincide with the first minimum of the Airy disk of the other
  - [telescope § visible light](../../../../general/telescope.md#visible%20light) (types of optical telescopes) ::: refracting telescope, reflecting telescope, catadioptric telescope
    - [refracting telescope](../../../../general/refracting%20telescope.md) ::: a type of optical telescope that uses a lens as its objective to form an image
      - [refracting telescope § technical considerations](../../../../general/refracting%20telescope.md#technical%20considerations) ::: chromatic and spherical aberration; and lens may be heavy and can only supported by its edge, leading to lens sagging; so most research telescopes are reflecting instead
        - [chromatic aberration](../../../../general/chromatic%20aberration.md) ::: a failure of a lens to focus all colors to the same point, caused by dispersion; the refractive index of most transparent materials decreases with increasing wavelength
      - [refracting telescope](../../../../general/refracting%20telescope.md) / examples ::: Yerkes 1-m refractor
    - [reflecting telescope](../../../../general/reflecting%20telescope.md) ::: an optical telescope that uses a single or a combination of curved mirrors that reflect light and form an image
      - [reflecting telescope](../../../../general/reflecting%20telescope.md) / examples ::: Gemini North 8-m; largest (as of 2024): Keck I and Keck II, Mauna Kea, Hawaii
        - Keck I and Keck II, Mauna Kea, Hawaii ::: They have an elevation of 4145 meters. Each has a 10-meter mirror consisting of 36 hexagonal mirror segments. They operate in the near-infrared and visible ranges.
  - [telescope](../../../../general/telescope.md) / radio telescope / examples ::: Arecibo Telescope, which had sent the Arecibo message (interstellar radio message) in 1974. The disk is big because the wavelength of radio waves are long and the waves themselves are faint.
  - [telescope](../../../../general/telescope.md) / X-ray telescope / examples ::: Chandra X-ray Observatory, which uses "grazing incidence" optics, which are mirrors with low grazing angle. It is orbiting Earth.
  - [telescope § in space](../../../../general/telescope.md#in%20space) ::: Telescopes are put into outer space to avoid light pollution, astronomical seeing (turbulence in the atmosphere), and because that the atmosphere absorbs most portion of electromagnetic spectrum.
    - [telescope § in space](../../../../general/telescope.md#in%20space) / [light pollution § effect on astronomy](../../../../general/light%20pollution.md#effect%20on%20astronomy) ::: Too much light from Earth overwhelms the faint starlight. So ground-based observatories are ideally located on calm or dry, dark, and high-altitude locations.
    - [telescope § in space](../../../../general/telescope.md#in%20space) / [astronomical seeing](../../../../general/astronomical%20seeing.md) ::: turbulence in the atmosphere leading to degrading of images of astronomical objects, such as blurring, distortion, and twinkling
    - [telescope § in space](../../../../general/telescope.md#in%20space) / atmosphere absorption ::: The observable bands are from visible to near-infrared and a portion of the radio-wave part of the spectrum.
- [adaptive optics](../../../../general/adaptive%20optics.md) ::: A mirror is actively deformed to compensate for current atmospheric turbulence, using a bright star near the science object (natural guide star) or laser beam (artificial guide star) as a reference to sense the turbulence.
- [radio astronomy](../../../../general/radio%20astronomy.md) ::: a subfield of astronomy that studies celestial objects at radio frequencies
  - [radio astronomy § radio telescopes](../../../../general/radio%20astronomy.md#radio%20telescopes) / problems ::: Recall Rayleigh's criterion, which says to get the same angular resolution, electromagnetic radiation of higher wavelengths require larger apertures. Since radio waves generally have wavelengths longer than 1 mm, which are thousands to billions times the visible light's wavelength (400 nm to 700 nm), so radio telescopes need to be very large to get high enough angular resolution. Yet, an extremely large radio telescope is still not enough to catch up with optical telescopes...
  - [radio astronomy § radio interferometry](../../../../general/radio%20astronomy.md#radio%20interferometry) ::: Signals from multiple radio telescopes can be combined using _interferometry_. The effective aperture ($D$) becomes the separation between telescopes, known as _baseline_, so the minimum angular size to distinguish ($\theta$) decreases. It has 2 drawbacks: the light-collecting ability is much weaker than a hypothetical instrument having the effective aperture, and the maximum angular size of detectable emissions is limited by the minimum baseline of the multiple radio telescopes.
    - [astronomical interferometer](../../../../general/astronomical%20interferometer.md)
    - [radio astronomy § radio interferometry](../../../../general/radio%20astronomy.md#radio%20interferometry) / examples ::: Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), with 27 telescopes spanning 36 km; perhaps setting up an observatory on the Moon for interferometry would be a great idea except for the price...
  - [radio astronomy](../../../../general/radio%20astronomy.md) / radio telescope examples ::: Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), Dawodang, Guizhou
- [infrared astronomy](../../../../general/infrared%20astronomy.md) / infrared telescope examples ::: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched on 2021-12-25, primarily for near-infrared and can also see red and orange visible light
- [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)
  - [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) / equatorial [radius](../../../../general/radius.md) ::: 696&nbsp;300&nbsp;[km](../../../../general/kilometre.md), 109&nbsp;[Earth radii](../../../../general/Earth%20radius.md)
  - [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) / [luminosity](../../../../general/luminosity.md) ::: 3.828×10<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;[W](../../../../general/watt.md)
  - [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) / [mass](../../../../general/mass.md) ::: 1.9885×10<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;[kg](../../../../general/kilogram.md), 332&nbsp;950&nbsp;[Earths](../../../../general/Earth%20mass.md)
  - Why does the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) shine? ::: John Herschel wondered about it in his _Treatise on Astronomy_, 1833. Yet, it is certainly not chemical energy. If the Sun were made of coal, a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows the Sun would only last for 6250 years.
    - "The sun's rays are the ultimate source of almost  every motion which takes place on the surface of the earth. By its heat are produced all winds,... By their vivifying action vegetables are elaborated from inorganic matter, and become, in their turn, the support of animals and of man, and the sources of those great deposits of dynamical efficiency which are laid up for human use in our coal strata." — _Treatise on Astronomy_, John Herschel 1833
    - [Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism](../../../../general/Kelvin–Helmholtz%20mechanism.md), gravitational contraction ::: A mechanism purposed in the late 19th century to explain the source of energy of the Sun. However, the Sun would only last for 8&nbsp;900&nbsp;000 years under this model, which was way better than other explanations but still insufficient to account for Earth's age of billions of years.
      - [Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism](../../../../general/Kelvin–Helmholtz%20mechanism.md) / details ::: When the surface of the Sun cools, it causes the internal pressure to drop, and the Sun shrinks as a result. This compression converts gravitational energy into kinetic energy, which is manifested as internal energy (microscopically, kinetic energy), so the core of the Sun heats up. In reality, this mechanism does occur in stars and planets, but is not the explanation for the Sun's energy.
    - Why does the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) shine? / correct explanation ::: The true source of the Sun's energy remained uncertain until the 1930s, when it was shown by Hans Bethe to be nuclear fusion (see his 1938 paper). It can account for the Sun's lifetime of about 10 billion years.
      - [mass–energy equivalence](../../../../general/mass–energy%20equivalence.md) / implications
- [nuclear fusion](../../../../general/nuclear%20fusion.md) ::: lighter atomic nuclei are merged to become heavier ones; nuclear fission is the opposite
  - [nuclear fusion](../../../../general/nuclear%20fusion.md) / energy relations ::: Apply Einstein's equation $E = m c^2$ to find the energy released from nuclear fusion.
  - [nuclear fusion](../../../../general/nuclear%20fusion.md) / [nuclear binding energy](../../../../general/nuclear%20binding%20energy.md) ::: The higher the nuclear binding energy of a nucleus, the more stable the nucleus.
  - [nuclear fusion](../../../../general/nuclear%20fusion.md) / conditions ::: Dense (>160 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, >10<sup>10</sup> atm) and hot (>10 million K, initially comes from gravitational contraction), so that nuclei can overcome their electric repulsion (protons are positively charged) and fused into one by the very-short-range strong force. (Okay, this explanation is incomplete... The actual chance of fusion is $10^{-290}$ in the Sun's core under classical physics, i.e. impossible, but fusion becomes plausible after taking quantum mechanics into consideration.)
- [hydrostatic equilibrium](../../../../general/hydrostatic%20equilibrium.md) ::: a body of fluid or plastic solid in equilibrium, implying inward forces equals outward forces
  - [hydrostatic equilibrium](../../../../general/hydrostatic%20equilibrium.md) / the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) ::: internal pressure from nuclear fusion outward = self-gravity
  - gravitational expansion ::: opposite of gravitational contraction: expanding gases cool down
  - [hydrostatic equilibrium](../../../../general/hydrostatic%20equilibrium.md) / star formation ::: Gravitational contraction heats up the core of contracting cloud of gas. Eventually, it is hot enough that nuclear fusion occurs. At that point, the pressure from nuclear fusion opposes further contraction, achieving hydrostatic equilibrium.
  - [hydrostatic equilibrium](../../../../general/hydrostatic%20equilibrium.md) / [Sun § core](../../../../general/Sun.md#core) ::: Like a thermostat, the core pressure outward is controlled by the core temperature such that it is in equilibrium with self-gravity. Core pressure negatively affects the core temperature, as pressure increase/decrease leads to expansion/contracting, decreasing/increasing the temperature. And core temperature positively affects the core pressure, as temperature decrease/increase leads to fusion rate decrease/increase, so core pressure decreases/increases. Overall, core pressure is in a negative feedback loop, so any _small_ perturbations in the loop will eventually be corrected.
- [Sun § structure and fusion](../../../../general/Sun.md#structure%20and%20fusion) ::: from the outside to inside: solar wind, corona, chromosphere, photosphere, convection zone, radiation zone, core
  - [solar wind](../../../../general/solar%20wind.md) ::: a flow of charged particles from the surface of the Sun

  - [Sun § photosphere](../../../../general/Sun.md#photosphere), [photosphere](../../../../general/photosphere.md) ::: visible surface of the Sun, with a temperature of 5772 K
  - [Sun § convective zone](../../../../general/Sun.md#convective%20zone), [convection zone](../../../../general/convection%20zone.md) ::: a layer which is unstable due to convection, where energy is primarily or partially transported by convection (rising hot gas); with a temperature of about 1.5 million K at the bottom to 5772 K at the top
  - [Sun § radiative zone](../../../../general/Sun.md#radiative%20zone), [radiation zone](../../../../general/radiation%20zone.md) ::: a layer where energy is primarily transported toward the exterior by means of radiative diffusion (photons) and thermal conduction, rather than by convection; with a temperature of about 7 million K at the bottom to 1.5 million K at the top
  - [Sun § core](../../../../general/Sun.md#core), [solar core](../../../../general/solar%20core.md) ::: location of nuclear fusion, with a temperature of about 15.7 million K
- heat transfer in the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) ::: convection in the convection zone, radiation in the radiation zone
  - modes of heat transfer ::: 3 usual modes: conduction, convection, radiation
  - heat transfer in the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) / mechanisms ::: convection zone: heavier elements are not ionized, so can absorb radiation, and hot plasma at the bottom rises to take energy to the surface; radiation zone: all atoms are ionized, and photons randomly bounces until it leaks out of the radiation zone
  - heat transfer in the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) / [photon](../../../../general/photon.md) scattering ::: convection zone: less-absorptive scattering, traveling via electrons; radiation zone: more-absorptive scattering, traveling via electrons, sometimes with ionization and recombination; overall, it takes about 1 million years to travel from the core, across the radiation zone, to the convection zone
- [solar granule](../../../../general/solar%20granule.md) ::: bubbling convection cells on the Sun's surface, each about 700&nbsp;000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in size (e.g. an image of the Sun's surface by Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope)
- [radiation zone § main sequence stars](../../../../general/radiation%20zone.md#main%20sequence%20stars) / dependence on mass ::: (order is from inside to outside) less than 0.4 solar masses: convective; about 1 solar mass: core, radiative, and convective; much greater than 1 solar mass: convective, radiative
- [proton–proton chain](../../../../general/proton–proton%20chain.md) ::: It is the main nuclear fusion occurring in the Sun (~99.2%), with the other being the CNO cycle (~0.8%). In both processes, hydrogen are converted into helium.
  - [proton–proton chain § the p–p I branch](../../../../general/proton–proton%20chain.md#the%20p–p%20I%20branch) ::: The only branch that we will learn only.
  - [proton–proton chain](../../../../general/proton–proton%20chain.md) / steps reminder ::: Remember to specify the isotope for the chemical symbols, because the reaction involves different isotopes of the same element.
  - [proton–proton chain](../../../../general/proton–proton%20chain.md) / step 1 ::: (happens twice) <sup>1</sup>H + <sup>1</sup>H → <sup>2</sup>He + e<sup>+</sup> + ν<sub>e</sub>
  - [proton–proton chain](../../../../general/proton–proton%20chain.md) / step 2 ::: (happens twice) <sup>2</sup>H + <sup>1</sup>H → <sup>3</sup>He + γ
  - [proton–proton chain](../../../../general/proton–proton%20chain.md) / step 3 ::: (happens once) <sup>3</sup>He + <sup>3</sup>He → <sup>4</sup>He + <sup>1</sup>H + <sup>1</sup>H
  - [proton–proton chain](../../../../general/proton–proton%20chain.md) / overall ::: 4 <sup>1</sup>H → <sup>4</sup>He + 2 e<sup>+</sup> + 2 ν<sub>e</sub> + 2 γ
  - [proton–proton chain](../../../../general/proton–proton%20chain.md) / energy calculations ::: The 4 hydrogen nuclei have a weight of 6.693×10<sup>-27</sup>&nbsp;kg, but the helium nucleus has a weight of 6.645×10<sup>-27</sup>&nbsp;kg. The difference in mass, 4.8×10<sup>-29</sup>&nbsp;kg (~0.7%), is converted into energy by the mass–energy equivalence: 4.8×10<sup>-29</sup>(299&nbsp;792&nbsp;458)<sup>2</sup> ≈ 4.31×10<sup>-12</sup>&nbsp;J.
- [neutrino](../../../../general/neutrino.md) ::: Chinese: 微中子/中微子; light, electrically neutral particles, that rarely interacts with ordinary matter if at all (weak interaction and gravity) and travels at _nearly_ the speed of light
  - [neutrino](../../../../general/neutrino.md) / sources ::: cosmic rays, the Sun
  - [neutrino](../../../../general/neutrino.md) / facts ::: Neutrinos interact with matter so rarely that, unlike photons, they immediately leave the Sun at _nearly_ the speed of light after production; so neutrinos can tell us about the Sun's core almost immediately. Another example is that about 10<sup>15</sup> neutrinos pass through a human body every second, but we do not notice them at all.
  - [solar neutrino problem](../../../../general/solar%20neutrino%20problem.md) ::: Actual measurement detected only about one third of that was predicted by models of nuclear fusion. Neutrinos were missing!
    - [solar neutrino problem § resolution](../../../../general/solar%20neutrino%20problem.md#resolution) ::: First, there are 3 flavors of neutrinos: electron neutrino, muon neutrino, tau neutrino. Second, neutrino changes flavors as they travel, called neutrino oscillation. Since previous detectors only detected the 1st flavor, so they detected about only one-third the expected count. When all flavors are detected using modern detectors, the detected count matches expectation.
      - [neutrino oscillation](../../../../general/neutrino%20oscillation.md)
        - [neutrino oscillation](../../../../general/neutrino%20oscillation.md) / Nobel prize ::: 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics, by Takaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald, for "for the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass"
  - [neutrino detector](../../../../general/neutrino%20detector.md) ::: Because neutrinos rarely interact with ordinary matter, detectors are very large. They are also often underground to isolate them from background radiation.
- self-reading, not tested
  - [solar phenomena](../../../../general/solar%20phenomena.md) ::: solar flare, solar prominence, sunspot; related to magnetic fields
    - [sunspot](../../../../general/sunspot.md) ::: They areas on the Sun that are cooler than the surrounding area (~4500&nbsp;K) and have strong magnetic fields. The Zeeman effect, in which strong magnetic fields split a spectral line into several lines, can be used to measure their magnetic fields.
      - [Zeeman effect](../../../../general/Zeeman%20effect.md) ::: splitting of degenerate atomic energy levels caused by magnetic field splits the spectral lines
      - [sunspot](../../../../general/sunspot.md) / inhibition of convection ::: The plasma (charged particles) of the Sun spiral along the magnetic field lines in one direction (e.g. either upward or downward), suppressing convection.
    - [solar prominence](../../../../general/solar%20prominence.md) ::: plasma from the chromosphere gets trapped in magnetic loops extending outwards from the Sun's surface, reaching in the order of 10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;km above the photosphere
    - [solar flare](../../../../general/solar%20flare.md) ::: local bursts of X-rays and charged particles into space, caused by magnetic storms
    - [coronal mass ejection](../../../../general/coronal%20mass%20ejection.md) ::: huge, balloon-shaped plasma bursts of energetic charged particles sent through the solar system, which can disrupt disable communications satellites and electrical power grids
    - [stellar corona § coronal heating problem](../../../../general/stellar%20corona.md#coronal%20heating%20problem) ::: The problem is why is the Sun's corona so hot (>1 million K) compared to its photosphere (5772&nbsp;K)? As of 2024, it is still not resolved, but wave heating and magnetic reconnection are two most likely candidates.
      - [stellar corona § magnetic reconnection theory](../../../../general/stellar%20corona.md#magnetic%20reconnection%20theory) ::: When the magnetic field lines in the chromosphere broke or get tangled up, they can explosively reconnect to convert magnetic energy into thermal energy. It can heat up the corona significantly.
      - [stellar corona § coronal heating problem](../../../../general/stellar%20corona.md#coronal%20heating%20problem) / low corona density ::: Even if a small input energy is inputted at the chromosphere (base of the corona), it gets "amplified" as the plasma density decreases. Each plasma particle has higher energy individually, so as respect the conservation of energy. So plasma at the corona can be heated up significantly even with little energy.
        - [stellar corona § coronal heating problem](../../../../general/stellar%20corona.md#coronal%20heating%20problem) / low corona density / examples ::: Compare a bead and a chain of bead connected to a table. Make the bead and the bead at the end of the chain start falling from the same height. One would find that the bead at the end of the chain falls faster than the lone bead. A much more intuitive example is a cracking whip. The end of the whip away from the hand oscillates significantly even though the hand may not be.
          - [stellar corona § coronal heating problem](../../../../general/stellar%20corona.md#coronal%20heating%20problem) / low corona density / examples / falling chain experiment ::: Compare a bead and a chain of bead connected to a table. Make the bead and the bead at the end of the chain start falling from the same height. One would find that the bead at the end of the chain falls faster than the lone bead. One way to see this is conservation of energy or conservation of momentum. A more thorough explanation is as follows: Consider the beads at the very bottom at every moment. When they stop falling down, a force pulls them up to decelerate them. The force comes from the part of the chain that has already fallen and also the part of the chain that has not yet fallen. By Newton's third law, the part of the chain that has not yet fallen gets pulled downward, apart from gravity. So the end bead accelerates faster than the lone bead, which is only affected by gravity.

- [star](../../../../general/star.md) / properties ::: brightness & luminosity, density of the atmosphere, distance, lifetime, mass, radius, surface temperature
- [apparent magnitude](../../../../general/apparent%20magnitude.md), apparent brightness ::: brightness of the star as seen on Earth, dependant on its luminosity and distance to Earth; for this course, measured of radiant energy that reaches Earth, in W/m<sup>2</sup>
  - [apparent magnitude](../../../../general/apparent%20magnitude.md) / examples ::: Betelgeuse vs Procyon: 2 of the 3 vertices of the "Winter Triangle", and they appear equally bright in our sky even though former's luminosity is about 5000 times that of latter
  - [apparent magnitude](../../../../general/apparent%20magnitude.md) / difference from [luminosity](../../../../general/luminosity.md) ::: Apparent magnitude is the radiant energy of a star that reaches Earth, while luminosity is all power the star emits.
  - [apparent magnitude](../../../../general/apparent%20magnitude.md) & [inverse-square law](../../../../general/inverse-square%20law.md) ::: Light follows the inverse-square law. The apparent brightness of a star is its luminosity divided by the surface area of a sphere of radius that is the distance to the star: $$B = \frac L {4\pi d^2} \qquad L = 4\pi d^2 B$$.
- measuring [distance](../../../../general/distance.md) to stars ::: use stellar parallax, and use the diameter of Earth's orbit as the baseline (~2 AU, ~1 AU considering the definition of parallax)
  - [stellar parallax](../../../../general/stellar%20parallax.md) ::: _Half_ (making the effective baseline ~1 AU instead of ~2 AU) of the total shift in angle of a star at two points opposite on Earth's orbit (~2 AU apart).
    - [stellar parallax](../../../../general/stellar%20parallax.md) / examples ::: surveying objects from a baseline, and use trigonometry to figure out the distances to the objects
  - [small-angle approximation](../../../../general/small-angle%20approximation.md) ::: For _small angles $\theta$ measured in radians_, $$\sin \theta \approx \tan \theta \approx \theta$$.
    [small-angle approximation](../../../../general/small-angle%20approximation.md) & [astronomy](../../../../general/astronomy.md) ::: In astronomy, most stellar parallax to stars are small. So small-angle approximation is very accurate. For example, to calculate the distance from Earth to a star using stellar parallax, we can skip using trigonometric functions: $$d = \frac {1~\text{AU} } {\tan \theta} \approx \frac {1~\text{AU} } \theta$$.
- [parsec](../../../../general/parsec.md) ::: (symbol: pc) the distance at which 1 AU subtends an angle of 1 arcsecond, i.e. $$1\text{ parsec} = \frac {1~\text{AU} } {\tan {1''} } \approx \frac {1~\text{AU} } {\frac \pi {648\,000} } = \frac {648\,000} \pi~\text{AU}$$ (In fact, the International Astronomical Union define 1 parsec as the "approximated" value $\frac {648\,000} \pi~\text{AU}$ instead of the "actual" value $\frac {1~\text{AU} } {\tan 1''}$.)
  - [parsec](../../../../general/parsec.md) / equation ::: $$d\text{ (in parsec)} = \frac {1~\text{AU} } {\theta\text{ (in arcsecond)} }$$
  - [parsec](../../../../general/parsec.md) / approximation ::: ~3.26&nbsp;ly, ~206&nbsp;265&nbsp;AU
- [angular resolution](../../../../general/angular%20resolution.md) / examples ::: human eye: ~1 arcmin (not enough to see the stellar parallax of the nearest star, Alpha Centauri that is 4.3 ly away, which is less than 1 arcsecond), telescope: ~0.03 arcseconds (up to ~100 ly), current technology (as of 2024): ~1.3 pc to ~200 pc
- [luminosity](../../../../general/luminosity.md) / range for [stars](../../../../general/star.md) ::: in the order of 10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> times the Sun's luminosity
- [apparent magnitude](../../../../general/apparent%20magnitude.md) ::: (symbol: $m$) A system for classifying brightness devised by Greek astronomer Hipparchus. Brightest stars visible were called first class or magnitude 1. Faintest stars visible were called sixth class or magnitude 6. So a larger magnitude means dimmer. Nowadays, the system is defined mathematically to closely match the above historical system.
  - [apparent magnitude](../../../../general/apparent%20magnitude.md) / examples ::: the Sun: -26.832, the full Moon: -12.74, naked eye limit: ~6
  - [apparent magnitude](../../../../general/apparent%20magnitude.md) / the system ::: decrease of 5 magnitudes implies 100 times the apparent brightness, and a decrease of 1 magnitude implies $\sqrt[5]{100} \approx 2.512$ times the apparent brightness
  - [apparent magnitude](../../../../general/apparent%20magnitude.md) / equations ::: $$\frac {B_A} {B_B} = \left(\sqrt[5]{100}\right)^{m_B - m_A} = 100^{\frac {m_B - m_A} 5}$$, where $B_*$ are star brightnesses and $m_*$ are apparent magnitudes
- [absolute magnitude](../../../../general/absolute%20magnitude.md) ::: (symbol: $M$) the apparent magnitude of a star if it were viewed from a distance of exactly 10 parsecs (~32.6 light-years) and without light extinction (dimming)
  - [absolute magnitude](../../../../general/absolute%20magnitude.md) / motivation ::: To provide comparison of stars' luminosities by treating all stars the same distance away, so that distances and extinction do not affect the apparent magnitude, and luminosity is the only factor.
  - [absolute magnitude](../../../../general/absolute%20magnitude.md) / equations ::: $$\frac {L_A} {L_B} = \left(\sqrt[5]{100}\right)^{M_B - M_A} = 100^{\frac {M_B - M_A} 5}$$, where $L_*$ are star luminosities and $M_*$ are absolute magnitudes
- [distance modulus](../../../../general/distance%20modulus.md) ::: (symbol: $\mu$) the apparent magnitude subtracted by the absolute magnitude: $$\mu := m - M$$, which tells the distance to a star using the 10 pc reference point; higher means larger distance
  - [distance modulus](../../../../general/distance%20modulus.md) / equations ::: (m & M equation) $$d\text{ (in parsec)} = 10^{\frac \mu 5 + 1} = 10^{\frac {m - M} 5 + 1}$$; so a increase of 5 in distance modulus implies multiplying the distance by 10
- [thermal radiation](../../../../general/thermal%20radiation.md)
  - [Stefan–Boltzmann law](../../../../general/Stefan–Boltzmann%20law.md)
  - [Wien approximation](../../../../general/Wien%20approximation.md)
  - [absorption spectrum](../../../../general/absorption%20spectroscopy.md#absorption%20spectrum)
- measuring star [temperature](../../../../general/temperature.md) ::: Stefan–Boltzmann law (using luminosity) cannot be used due to varying distance. Wien approximation (using wavelength) can be used in theory, but not in practice because interstellar medium can shift the wavelength in various ways. Absorption spectrum (using the level of ionization) are used in practice.
  - level of [ionization](../../../../general/ionization.md) & [temperature](../../../../general/temperature.md) ::: The higher the temperature, the higher the level of ionization.
  - level of [ionization](../../../../general/ionization.md) & [absorption spectrum](../../../../general/absorption%20spectroscopy.md#absorption%20spectrum) ::: Different levels of ionizations of different elements produce different absorption lines.
- [stellar classification](../../../../general/stellar%20classification.md) ::: classification of stars based on their spectral characteristics
  - [stellar classification § spectral types](../../../../general/stellar%20classification.md#spectral%20types) ::: (hotter/earlier/bluer) O > B > A > F > G > K > M (cooler/later/redder); each subdivided into (hotter/earlier/bluer) 0~9 (cooler/later/redder)
    - [stellar classification § spectral types](../../../../general/stellar%20classification.md#spectral%20types) / mnemonics ::: <u>O</u>h <u>B</u>e <u>A</u> <u>F</u>ine <u>G</u>uy/<u>G</u>irl <u>K</u>iss <u>M</u>e! <u>O</u>ur <u>B</u>right <u>A</u>stronomers <u>F</u>requently <u>G</u>enerate <u>K</u>iller <u>M</u>nemonics! <u>O</u>h, <u>B</u>e <u>A</u> <u>F</u>ool <u>G</u>uy, <u>K</u>ill <u>M</u>e! <u>O</u>h <u>B</u>oy, <u>A</u> <u>F</u> <u>G</u>rade <u>K</u>ills <u>M</u>e!
  - [stellar classification](../../../../general/stellar%20classification.md) / surface [temperature](../../../../general/temperature.md) range ::: (hotter/earlier/bluer) 50&nbsp;000&nbsp;K to 3&nbsp;000&nbsp;K (cooler/later/redder), with the Sun being ~5&nbsp;772&nbsp;K
  - [stellar classification](../../../../general/stellar%20classification.md) / history ::: The original classification scheme (ABC...O) was based on the strength of H absorption line strengths (c. 1890). Annie Jump Cannon is known for creating the Harvard Classification Scheme. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin later realized that the classification corresponds to the star's surface temperature.
- measuring [stellar mass](../../../../general/stellar%20mass.md) ::: using gravity and Kepler's 3rd law: $$T^2 = \frac {4\pi^2} {G(M + m)} a^3$$, where $T$ is the orbital period and $a$ is the semi-major axis
  - measuring [stellar mass](../../../../general/stellar%20mass.md) / details ::: $T$ and $a$ can be obtained from two of the following three parameters: orbital period, orbital separation (semi-major axis), orbital velocity. Then we can determine $M + m$. Lastly, to determine $M$ and $m$ separately, note that a body orbiting another body is more accurately described as the two bodies around their barycenter, which is also their center of mass. When $M \approx m$, the barycenter will be in approximately the middle of their orbital separation. Anyway, the distances from the two bodies to the barycenter can give the ratio of $M$ and $m$, which can be used to find $M$ and $m$ separately from $M + m$.
- self-study, but MAY be tested
  - [binary system](../../../../general/binary%20system.md)
    - [binary system](../../../../general/binary%20system.md) / proportion ::: about half of all stars are binary systems
    - [binary system § classification](../../../../general/binary%20system.md#classification) ::: multiple classifications can apply to a single binary; visual binary: binary nature visually observable; eclipsing binary: binary nature observable via eclipses; spectroscopic binary: binary nature observable using spectroscopy (e.g. Doppler effect)
      - [binary system § classification](../../../../general/binary%20system.md#classification) / visual binary examples ::: An example is Sirius A and Sirius B.
      - [binary system § classification](../../../../general/binary%20system.md#classification) / eclipsing binary & spectroscopic binary ::: A spectroscopic binary offers orbital velocity and period, thus the masses of the 2 stars can be calculated. If additionally, the binary is also an eclipsing binary, the sizes of the 2 stars can be measured from light curve dips, thus their densities can be calculated. Calculations are limited by that we do not know the orbital inclination.
- [stellar mass](../../../../general/stellar%20mass.md) ::: mass of a star, usually described in terms of solar masses
  - [stellar mass](../../../../general/stellar%20mass.md) / range for [stars](../../../../general/star.md) ::: ~0.08 _M_<sub>☉</sub> to ~265 _M_<sub>☉</sub> (R136a1), _M_<sub>☉</sub> is the Sun's mass; the theoretical limit is ~150 _M_<sub>☉</sub>
- patterns among [stars](../../../../general/star.md) ::: Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (HR diagram), giants, main sequence, supergiants, white dwarfs
- [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](../../../../general/Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md) (HR diagram) ::: scatter plotting stars' absolute magnitudes or luminosities (typically increasing upward, in logarithmic scale) against their stellar classifications or effective temperatures (typically decreasing rightward, in logarithmic scale, labelled with stellar classifications)
  - [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram § forms of diagram](../../../../general/Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md#forms%20of%20diagram) ::: We use the log–log plot.
  - [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](../../../../general/Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md) / graph ::: (only care about main sequence, giants, supergiants, and white dwarfs) ![Hertzsprung–Russell diagram image](../../../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/HR-diag-instability-strip.svg)
    - [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](../../../../general/Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md) / graph / description ::: Main sequence is a diagonal line from top left to bottom right. White dwarfs are a less steep and shorter diagonal line shifted below main sequence. Giants are a blob extending up-right from the middle of the main sequence strip. Supergiants is a horizontal line above giants and main sequence, somewhat touching main sequence at the left end.
  - [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram § interpretation](../../../../general/Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md#interpretation)
    - [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram § interpretation](../../../../general/Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md#interpretation) / [main sequence](../../../../general/main%20sequence.md) ::: Most stars (~90%) are in the main sequence strip. Stars are more likely to be found in the bottom-right as most stars are small and of low-temperature.
- measuring [star](../../../../general/star.md) [radii](../../../../general/radius.md) ::: Only nearby stars can have its radii measured directly, as other stars' angular sizes are too small to be resolved. Instead, it is calculated from luminosity and temperature using the Stefan–Boltzmann law.
  - [Stefan–Boltzmann law](../../../../general/Stefan–Boltzmann%20law.md)
  - [Wien approximation](../../../../general/Wien%20approximation.md)
  - measuring [star](../../../../general/star.md) radii / examples ::: A star is 625 times as luminous of the Sun, but with half of the temperature of the Sun (in Kelvin). By $L = 4\pi r^2 \varepsilon \sigma T^4 \implies L \propto T^4 r^2 \implies r \propto \sqrt{L / T^4} = L^{0.5} / T^2$, so that star's radius is $\sqrt{625} / 0.5^2 = 25 / 0.25 = 100$ times that of the Sun.
  - measuring [star](../../../../general/star.md) radii / range for [stars](../../../../general/star.md) ::: ~0.01 _R_<sub>☉</sub> to ~1800 _R_<sub>☉</sub>, _R_<sub>☉</sub> is the Sun's radius; excluding neutron stars
- [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](../../../../general/Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md)
  - [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](../../../../general/Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md) / star radii ::: Consider the equation $L = 4\pi r^2 \varepsilon \sigma T^4 \implies L \propto T^4 r^2$. As the graph is a log–log plot, apply logarithm on the above equation: $\log L = 4 \log T + 2 \log r + \text{const}$. Also note that the temperature axis is inverted. So we can see for a constant star radii $r$, the line is slopped from top-left to bottom-right as temperature $T$ decreases. Increasing star radii $r$ pushes the line to the top right while remaining parallel, and vice versa, like contour lines.
    - [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](../../../../general/Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md) / star radii / relations ::: The white dwarf strip has a similar slope to the line corresponding to a fixed star radii, while the main sequence strip is steeper than the aforementioned line, as temperature is correlated with star radii for main sequence stars. Giants and supergiants have larger star radii to have high luminosity due to their lower temperature. White dwarfs have smaller star radii to have low luminosity due to their high temperature.
- [stellar classification](../../../../general/stellar%20classification.md)
  - [stellar classification](../../../../general/stellar%20classification.md) / full description ::: spectral type, luminosity class, and spectral peculiarities
  - [stellar classification § Yerkes spectral classification](../../../../general/stellar%20classification.md#Yerkes%20spectral%20classification), luminosity class ::: classification of a star's luminosity
    - difference between [spectral type](../../../../general/stellar%20classification.md#spectral%20types) and luminosity class ::: The former is about absorption line identities, which is closely related to the surface temperature. The latter is about absorption line shapes, which is closely related to the atmosphere density and star radius.
    - [stellar classification § Yerkes spectral classification](../../../../general/stellar%20classification.md#Yerkes%20spectral%20classification) / [spectral line § pressure broadening](../../../../general/spectral%20line.md#pressure%20boardening) (collisional broadening) ::: High-density stellar atmosphere increases collision frequency, which interrupts emission and shortens its duration. By the uncertainty principle ($\Delta E \Delta t \ge \hbar / 2$), the energy of the emitted photon is more uncertain, so the spectral line broadens. As star radii generally anti-correlates with atmosphere density, larger stars have sharper spectral lines, and vice versa. This can be used to determine a star's luminosity class.
    - [stellar classification § Yerkes spectral classification](../../../../general/stellar%20classification.md#Yerkes%20spectral%20classification) / examples ::: Betelgeuse: M2 Ib, Proxima Centauri: M5.5 V, Sirius: A1 V, the Sun: G2 V
    - [stellar classification § Yerkes spectral classification](../../../../general/stellar%20classification.md#Yerkes%20spectral%20classification) / dwarfs ::: subdwarf: sd (_prefix_) or VI; white dwarf: D (_prefix_), w.d. (_prefix_), or VII
- [main sequence](../../../../general/main%20sequence.md)
  - [main sequence](../../../../general/main%20sequence.md) / [stellar mass](../../../../general/stellar%20mass.md) ::: Heavier stars are larger in size; greater in self-gravity and outward pressure to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium; and higher core temperature, thus higher fusion rates and shorter lifespans in the main sequence. This explains why larger stars are bluer, hotter, and more luminous. It also explains why most stars are on the bottom-right of the main sequence band in the HR diagram.
  - [mass–luminosity relation](../../../../general/mass–luminosity%20relation.md) ::: empirically found to be related by power law: $$\frac L {L_\odot} \approx C \left(\frac M {M_\odot} \right)^a$$, where $L_\odot$ is the solar luminosity and $M_\odot$ is the solar mass
    - [mass–luminosity relation](../../../../general/mass–luminosity%20relation.md) / mass thresholds for main sequence ::: $0.43 M_\odot, 55 M_\odot$
    - [mass–luminosity relation](../../../../general/mass–luminosity%20relation.md) / $M < 0.43 M_\odot$ for main sequence ::: $a = 2.3, C \approx 0.36 \quad (\text{calculated from intercepting the next equation})$
    - [mass–luminosity relation](../../../../general/mass–luminosity%20relation.md) / $0.43 M_\odot \le M < 55 M_\odot$ for main sequence ::: $a = 3.5, C = 1$
    - [mass–luminosity relation](../../../../general/mass–luminosity%20relation.md) / $M \ge 55 M_\odot$ for main sequence ::: $a = 1, C \approx 22400 \quad (\text{calculated from intercepting the previous equation})$
    - [mass–luminosity relation](../../../../general/mass–luminosity%20relation.md) / lifetime for main sequence ::: One can derive the lifetime by noting lifetime is approximately proportional to $M / L$ (roughly $1 / (C M^{a - 1})$ times the Sun's lifetime when $M$ is in solar masses; assuming $a = 3.5, C = 1$, the equation is $1 / M^{2.5}$), as luminosity is roughly proportional to the fuel usage rate. Empirically, the actual lifetimes are shorter than predicted above.
      - [mass–luminosity relation](../../../../general/mass–luminosity%20relation.md) / lifetime for main sequence / consequences ::: More massive stars have higher luminosities, so have shorter lifetimes. So there are much less hotter stars than cooler stars at the same time.
  - [main sequence](../../../../general/main%20sequence.md) / off the main sequence ::: Stars end their main sequence after burning all of its available hydrogen fuel. larger than or equal to 0.25 solar masses: giants or supergiants; otherwise (red dwarfs): blue dwarfs (hypothetical), then white dwarfs, then black dwarfs (hypothetical)
    - [main sequence](../../../../general/main%20sequence.md) / off the main sequence / sizes ::: giants or supergiants: They are really massive compared to the Sun! The Sun in its red giant phase is predicted to be up to 256 times the current radius. dwarfs: They are really tiny compared! The Sun in its white dwarf phase is predicted to be slightly larger than the Moon.
- [star cluster](../../../../general/star%20cluster.md) ::: a large group star cluster believed to have form at similar time and with similar distance to Earth, as they were formed from a single giant interstellar gas cloud
  - [star cluster](../../../../general/star%20cluster.md) / uses ::: testing our understanding of stellar evolution and comparing properties of different stars that have similar ages
  - [star cluster](../../../../general/star%20cluster.md) / types ::: globular cluster, open cluster
  - [star cluster § globular cluster](../../../../general/star%20cluster.md#globular%20cluster) ::: very dense (1M stars in 60 to 150 ly), old, located in galaxy halos
    - [star cluster § globular cluster](../../../../general/star%20cluster.md#globular%20cluster) / examples ::: M80, 12 billion years old
  - [star cluster § open cluster](../../../../general/star%20cluster.md#open%20cluster) ::: less dense (~1000 stars in 30 ly), young, located in galaxy disks
  - [star cluster § open cluster](../../../../general/star%20cluster.md#open%20cluster) / examples ::: Pleiades, 100 million years old (Chinese: 昴（宿）星團, 七姊妹星團)
- [main sequence turnoff](../../../../general/main%20sequence%20turnoff.md) ::: the point on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram where a star leaves the main sequence after its main fuel is exhausted
  - [main sequence turnoff](../../../../general/main%20sequence%20turnoff.md) & [star cluster](../../../../general/star%20cluster.md) ::: Assuming stars in a star cluster are born at the same time, bluer/brighter/larger stars die faster than redder/dimmer/smaller stars. So plotting the stars on a HR diagram over extremely long time, it would look like a diagonal candle burning from top-left to bottom-right, with subgiant stars starting to shift up-right (looking like "smoke"; initially there is no "smoke" as no stars are dying).
    - [main sequence turnoff](../../../../general/main%20sequence%20turnoff.md) & [star cluster](../../../../general/star%20cluster.md) / determination ::: The topmost star in the HR diagram that has not shifted up-right from the main sequence strip at all. Then we can estimate the star cluster's age using $\tau_{\text{cl} } = 1 / M^{2.5}\text{ solar lifetimes}$ (assuming $a = 3.5, C = 1$ for most main sequence stars).
- [star cluster](../../../../general/star%20cluster.md) distance to Earth ([star cluster § astronomical significance](../../../../general/star%20cluster.md#astronomical%20significance)) ::: The lecture slides said that we can plot the apparent magnitudes of a star cluster's stars and compare them to the absolute magnitudes plotted on the same diagram, and then use the m & M equation to its distance to Earth, using the magnitude distance between the two main sequence strips. (It may also refer to using nearest star clusters, for which we can use the stellar parallax to determine their distances, to estimate distances of farther star clusters, by comparing their main sequence strip positions.)
