- HKUST PHYS 1002

The parenthesized text at the beginning of of each question is {@{the location the question appears in}@}. Questions beginning with `(derived)` are {@{derived from other questions and only appear here}@}. <!--SR:!2027-10-05,916,337!2027-07-31,867,337-->

Marking is done as follows. iPRS and MCQ questions are considered separately. For each type of questions, the best 80% are counted. Then the percentage is linearly scaled onto a 10-mark scale for iPRS and 15-mark scale for MCQ.

A moonrise time "reset" happens when the moon rises later by a cumulative time of 1 day.

We only need the $C$ for the third case: $$55^{3.5} = C \cdot 55^1 \implies C = 55^{2.5} \approx 22434.0004$$.

However, consider the energy exploded: $$E = \frac {GM^2} {10 \times 10^3} - \frac {GM^2} x = GM^2 \left(\frac 1 {10 \times 10^3} - \frac 1 x\right)$$, where $x$ is the typical radius of a white dwarf. One would realize, given that $x \ge 1000 \times 10^3$, since $x \gg 10 \times 10^3$, so $$\frac 1 {10 \times 10^3} - \frac 1 x \approx \frac 1 {10 \times 10^3}$$, which is a good enough approximation for this question. So, using the above approximation, calculate the energy released: $$E = \frac {GM^2} {10 \times 10^3} = \frac {6.674\,30 \times 10^{-11} \cdot \left( 2 \cdot 1.9885 \times 10^{30} \right)^2} {10 \times 10^3} \approx 1.055\,6426 \times 10^{47}~\mathrm{J} \,.$$ Then, calculate the energy released by the Sun over its lifetime: $$E_\odot = (3.828 \times 10^{26}) \cdot (10 \times 10^9) \cdot 365.25 \times 86\,400 \approx 1.208\,024\,93 \times 10^{44}~\mathrm{J} \,.$$ Now divide the first number by the second number to get the answer: $$\frac E {E_\odot} = \frac {1.055\,6426 \times 10^{47} } {1.208\,024\,93 \times 10^{44} } \approx 873.8583 \,.$$ So the answer is 1000 times.}@} <!--SR:!2028-03-15,1018,365!2025-11-04,325,325-->
