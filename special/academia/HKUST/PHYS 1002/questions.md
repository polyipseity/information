> Q1. (MCQ) The Moon rises later everyday by approximately how long?
>
> 1. 1 minute
> 2. 4 minutes
> 3. 1 hour
> 4. 2 hours
> 5. 3 hours
>
> - solution: {{3}}
> - steps: {{Recall that the moonrise time corresponds to the lunar phase cycle. As the cycle resets every 29.5 days, the moonrise time also resets 29.5 days. A moonrise time "reset" happens when the moon rises later by a cumulative time of 1 day. Thus the answer is: $$\frac {24} {29.5} \approx 0.813\,559\,322 \approx 1\text{ hour}$$.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-20,11,292!2024-07-26,17,312-->

> Q1. (iPRS) Assume that the orbits of all planets in the solar system are circular. Then a = r = orbital radius. By Kepler’s third law, p<sup>2</sup> ~ r<sup>3</sup>, the orbital speed v is
>
> 1. proportional to 1/r
> 2. proportional to r^(-1/2)
> 3. independent of r
> 4. proportional to r^(1/2)
> 5. proportional to r
>
> - solution: {{2}}
> - steps: {{The orbital period $p$ is proportional to the inverse of angular orbital velocity $1 / \omega$. Further, linear orbital velocity (speed) $v$ relates to angular orbital velocity by $v = r \omega \implies \omega = v / r$. Therefore, $$p^2 \propto r^3 \implies \omega^{-2} \propto r^3 \implies r^2 / v^2 \propto r^3 \implies r^{-1} \propto v^2 \implies v \propto r^{-1 / 2}$$. Therefore the answer is $v \propto r^{-1 / 2}$}}.

Plug in the numbers: $$v = \sqrt{\frac {9.8} {1000} \cdot 6400} = \sqrt{62.72} \approx 7.91959595\text{ km/s}$$. Therefore, the answer is 7.9 km/s.}}

> 5. 11 km/s
>
> - solution: {{2}}
> - steps: {{Recall that the acceleration due to gravity is inversely proportional to the square of distance: $g \propto \frac 1 {r^2}$. Therefore, the acceleration due to gravity 400 km above the surface is: $$g = 9.8 \cdot \frac {6400^2} {6800^2} \approx 8.68096886\text{ m/s}$$. Now, equate circular acceleration to gravitational acceleration: $$a = g \implies \frac {v^2} r = g \implies v^2 = gr \implies v = \sqrt{gr}$$. Plug in the numbers: $$v = \sqrt{\frac {8.68096886} {1000} \cdot 6800} \approx 7.6831366\text{ km/s}$$. Therefore, the answer is 7.7 km/s}}.

Then calculate its lifetime by dividing it by the power of the Sun: $$t = \frac {1.8 \times 10^{44} } {3.8 \times 10^{26} } \approx 4.73684211 \times 10^{17}\text{ s} \approx 1.5010468 \times 10^{10}\text{ yrs} \approx 15\text{ billion years}$$.
