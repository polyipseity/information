> Q1. (lecture) This photo shows the Andromeda Galaxy as it looked about 2.5 million years ago. (HISTORIC Photograph)
>
> Question: When will we be able to see what it looks like __now__?

> Q2. (iPRS) According to our definition, the look-back time of an object is
>
> 1. the age of the Universe when the light received by us now was first emitted from the object
> 2. the age of the Universe now minus the time taken for the light from the object to reach the Earth
> 3. the time elapsed between when we detect the light here on Earth and when it was originally emitted by the source
> 4. smaller for more distant objects
> 5. larger for nearer objects

> Q3. (MCQ) If you can count one star per second, how long will it take for you to count all stars in the observable universe?
>
> 1. 3 thousand years
> 2. 3 million years
> 3. 3 billion years
> 4. 3 trillion years
> 5. 3 hundred trillion years
>
> - solution: {{5}}
> - steps: {{Given there are about 10<sup>22</sup> stars, divide it by the number of seconds in a year: $$\frac {10^{22} } {86400 \times 365} \approx 3.17 \times 10^{14}\text{ years}$$ to get about 300 trillion (300 × 10<sup>12</sup>) years.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-17,17,290!2024-07-10,10,270-->

> Q2. (MCQ) A hypothetical planet has an orbital period around the Sun equal to 6 sidereal days of the planet. The self-rotation and orbital rotation are in the same direction. How long is its solar day?
>
> 1. 7/6 sidereal days
> 2. 6/5 sidereal days
> 3. 5/4 sidereal days
> 4. 4/3 sidereal days
> 5. 3/2 sidereal days
>
> - solution: {{2}}
> - steps: {{The planet is in prograde motion. Hence, the number of solar days per orbital period is $6 - 1 = 5\text{ solar days}$. Thus each solar day is $\frac {1 / 5} {1 / 6} = \frac 6 5\text{ sidereal days}$.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-14,12,277!2024-07-14,12,277-->

> Q4. (derived) A hypothetical planet has an orbital period around its parent star equal to 42 solar days of the planet. The self-rotation and orbital rotation are in the opposite direction. How long is its sidereal day?

> 1. 43/44 solar days

> 4. 42/43 solar days
> 5. 41/42 solar days
> 6. 44/43 solar days
>
> - solution: {{3}}
> - steps: {{The planet is in retrograde motion. Hence, the number of sidereal days per orbital period is $42 - 1 = 41\text{ sidereal days}$. Thus each sidereal day is $\frac {1 / 41} {1 / 42} = \frac {42} {41}\text{ solar days}$.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-11,9,277!2024-07-12,10,277-->

> Q1. (lecture) What would seasons be like for a planet with 90 degree axial tilt?
>
> - solution: {{There would be no seasons. Instead, every location is daytime for half the orbital period and nighttime for the other half, like the north and south pole on Earth. Likely unliveable.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-24,17,308-->

> Q4. (derived) There is a planet with a satellite orbiting a star. The planet completes an orbit in 420 years relative to distant stars. The satellite completes an orbit in 69 years relative to distant stars. The orbiting direction of the satellite is prograde to that of the planet. What is the synodic orbital period of the satellite relative to the star as viewed from the planet, rounded to the nearest year?
>
> 1. 69 years
> 2. 83 years
> 3. 59 years
> 4. 82 years
> 5. 420 years
> 6. 60 years
>
> - solution: {{2}}
> - steps: {{Since the relative orbital motion between the planet and the satellite is prograde, apply the equation: $$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} - \frac 1 {T_2} \quad T_1 < T_2$$. Thus we have $T_\text{syn} = \frac 1 {\frac 1 {T_1} - \frac 1 {T_2} } = \frac 1 {\frac 1 {69} - \frac 1 {420} } \approx 82.564\,1026 \approx 83\text{ years}$.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-15,7,270!2024-07-14,6,270-->

> Q6. (derived) There are 2 planets orbiting a star. The 1st planet completes an orbit in 7 years relative to the fixed stars. The 2nd planet completes an orbit in 1 year relative to the 1st planet. The orbiting direction of the 2 planets are retrograde to each other. What is the sidereal orbital period of the 2nd planet?

> 2. 1 year
> 3. 8/7 years
> 4. 7 years
> 5. 7/8 years
> 6. 7/6 years
>
> - solution: {{6}}
> - steps: {{Since the relative orbital motion between the 2 planets is retrograde, apply the equation: $$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} + \frac 1 {T_2}$$. Thus we have $T_2 = \frac 1 {\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } - \frac 1 {T_1} } = \frac 1 {\frac 1 1 - \frac 1 7} = \frac 7 6\text{ years}$.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-14,6,270!2024-07-09,4,290-->

> Q1. (MCQ) The Moon rises later everyday by approximately how long?
>
> 1. 1 minute
> 2. 4 minutes
> 3. 1 hour
> 4. 2 hours
> 5. 3 hours
>
> - solution: {{3}}
> - steps: {{Recall that the moonrise time corresponds to the lunar phase cycle. As the cycle resets every 29.5 days, the moonrise time also resets 29.5 days. A moonrise time "reset" happens when the moon rises later by a cumulative time of 1 day. Thus the answer is: $$\frac {24} {29.5} \approx 0.813\,559\,322 \approx 1\text{ hour}$$.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-09,4,292!2024-07-09,4,292-->

> Q2. (derived) The two (or three) eclipse seasons start earlier every year by approximately how long?
>
> 1. 0 days (does not start earlier every year)
> 2. 365 days
> 3. 30 days
> 4. 20 days
> 5. 366 days
>
> - solution: {{4}}
> - steps: {{Recall that the eclipse season depends on the line of lunar nodes. Consider that the lunar nodes rotates retrograde (clockwise) once about 18.6 years. The answer is: $$\frac {365.25} {18.6} \approx 19.637\,0967 \approx 20\text{ days}$$.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-09,4,292!2024-07-14,6,272-->
