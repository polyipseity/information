> Q4. (derived) There is a planet with a satellite orbiting a star. The planet completes an orbit in 420 years relative to distant stars. The satellite completes an orbit in 69 years relative to distant stars. The orbiting direction of the satellite is prograde to that of the planet. What is the synodic orbital period of the satellite relative to the star as viewed from the planet, rounded to the nearest year?

Thus we have $T_2 = \frac 1 {\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } - \frac 1 {T_1} } = \frac 1 {\frac 1 1 - \frac 1 7} = \frac 7 6\text{ years}$.}} <!--SR:!2024-08-05,22,290!2024-07-22,13,290-->

> Q1. (MCQ) The Moon rises later everyday by approximately how long?
>
> 1. 1 minute
> 2. 4 minutes
> 3. 1 hour
> 4. 2 hours
> 5. 3 hours
>
> - solution: {{3}}
> - explanation: {{Recall that the moonrise time corresponds to the lunar phase cycle. As the cycle resets every 29.5 days, the moonrise time also resets 29.5 days. A moonrise time "reset" happens when the moon rises later by a cumulative time of 1 day. Thus the answer is: $$\frac {24} {29.5} \approx 0.813\,559\,322 \approx 1\text{ hour}$$.}} <!--SR:!2024-09-01,42,312!2024-07-26,17,312-->

> 4. 20 days
> 5. 366 days
>
> - solution: {{4}}
> - explanation: {{Recall that the eclipse season depends on the line of lunar nodes. Consider that the lunar nodes rotates retrograde (clockwise) once about 18.6 years.

> Q1. (iPRS) Assume that the orbits of all planets in the solar system are circular. Then a = r = orbital radius. By Kepler’s third law, p<sup>2</sup> ~ r<sup>3</sup>, the orbital speed v is
>
> 1. proportional to 1/r
> 2. proportional to r^(-1/2)
> 3. independent of r
> 4. proportional to r^(1/2)
> 5. proportional to r
>
> - solution: {{2}}
> - explanation: {{The orbital period $p$ is proportional to the inverse of angular orbital velocity $1 / \omega$. Further, linear orbital velocity (speed) $v$ relates to angular orbital velocity by $v = r \omega \implies \omega = v / r$. Therefore, $$p^2 \propto r^3 \implies \omega^{-2} \propto r^3 \implies r^2 / v^2 \propto r^3 \implies r^{-1} \propto v^2 \implies v \propto r^{-1 / 2}$$. Therefore the answer is $v \propto r^{-1 / 2}$.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-31,10,301!2024-08-07,17,321-->

> What is the orbital velocity of a satellite which orbits the Earth at sea-level? It is given that the radius of the Earth is 6400 km and the acceleration due to gravity at sea-level is 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.

>
> - solution: {{3}}
> - explanation: {{Equate circular acceleration to gravitational acceleration: $$a = g \implies \frac {v^2} r = g \implies v^2 = gr \implies v = \sqrt{gr}$$. Plug in the numbers: $$v = \sqrt{\frac {9.8} {1000} \cdot 6400} = \sqrt{62.72} \approx 7.91959595\text{ km/s}$$. Therefore, the answer is 7.9 km/s.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-28,7,281!2024-07-30,9,281-->

> Q3. (derived) What is the orbital velocity of a satellite which orbits the Earth at 400 km above the surface? It is given that the radius of the Earth is 6400 km and the acceleration due to gravity at sea-level is 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.

> 3. 7.9 km/s
> 4. 9.8 km/s
> 5. 11 km/s
>
> - solution: {{2}}
> - explanation: {{Recall that the acceleration due to gravity is inversely proportional to the square of distance: $g \propto \frac 1 {r^2}$. Therefore, the acceleration due to gravity 400 km above the surface is: $$g = 9.8 \cdot \frac {6400^2} {6800^2} \approx 8.68096886\text{ m/s}$$. Now, equate circular acceleration to gravitational acceleration: $$a = g \implies \frac {v^2} r = g \implies v^2 = gr \implies v = \sqrt{gr}$$. Plug in the numbers: $$v = \sqrt{\frac {8.68096886} {1000} \cdot 6800} \approx 7.6831366\text{ km/s}$$. Therefore, the answer is 7.7 km/s.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-31,10,301!2024-08-01,11,301-->

Calculate the total emitted energy over the Sun's lifetime: $$E = 2 \times 10^{30} \cdot 0.001 \cdot (3 \times 10^8)^2 = 1.8 \times 10^{44}\text{ J}$$. Then calculate the Sun's lifetime by dividing it by the power of the Sun: $$t = \frac {1.8 \times 10^{44} } {3.8 \times 10^{26} } \approx 4.73684211 \times 10^{17}\text{ s} \approx 1.5010468 \times 10^{10}\text{ yrs} \approx 15\text{ billion years}$$.

>
> 1. red in color
> 2. white in color
> 3. green in color
> 4. blue in color
>
> - solution: {{2}}
> - explanation: {{Consider the graph of spectral radiance for that star, which peaks at 530 nm. It should look like a hill with somewhat narrow peak. However, the narrow peak should cover the entire visible spectrum. As the spectral radiance is approximately even around the peak, that means it is approximately even over the entire visible spectrum, so the color is white.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-24,3,288!2024-07-25,4,308-->

>
> 1. red
> 2. yellow
> 3. white
> 4. blue
> 5. purple
>
> - solution: {{5}}
> - explanation: {{Purple is the combination of red and blue. However, red and blue are on the two opposite ends of the visible spectrum, so the spectral radiance graph would need to have 2 peaks. This is impossible for thermal radiation to produce, as predicted by the Wien approximation.

> Q1. (iPRS) From laboratory measurements, we know that a particular spectral line appears at a certain wavelength. The line width is very small and can be ignored. A star is moving with negligible velocity relative to the Earth but self-rotating very fast. Assume that the Earth lies on the equatorial plane of the star. What will be observed of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the star?
>
> 1. Broadened (line width increased) but (the center of line) un-shifted.
> 2. Broadened (line width increased) and (the center of line) red-shifted.
> 3. Broadened (line width increased) and (the center of line) blue-shifted.
> 4. No width broadening and un-shifted.
> 5. No width broadening but red-shifted.
> 6. No width broadening but blue-shifted.
>
> - solution: {{1}}
> - explanation: {{First, the star is not moving, so the spectral line should be unshifted. Now consider the surface of a very fast rotating star. In particular, consider the left and right sides of the rotating star. The surface of one side is approaching us very quickly, and that of the other side is moving away from us very quickly as well. This would mean part of the light from the star is blue-shifted and another part is red-shifted. The result is that the spectral line broadens.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-25,4,308!2024-07-25,4,308-->

> Q2. (derived) A binary star system consists of two stars orbiting each other. Assume a binary star system, with circular orbits, is not moving relative to Earth, and its orbital plane is parallel to that of Earth. When the system is dimmer than what it normally is, what are the detected Doppler shifts of the two stars?

> 1. red shift for one star, blue shift for the other star

> 4. red shift for both stars
> 5. blue shift for both stars
> 6. almost no shift for both stars
>
> - solution: {{6}}
> - explanation: {{When the system is dimmer than what it normally is, it implies one star is in front of the other star. Consider that both stars are always opposite in their orbits. So the stars must be in the part of the orbit closest to or farthest from Earth (this is true for circular orbits, but gets less true the more elliptic the orbits are). That means both stars are moving mostly transversal to Earth, taking into consideration that the system as a whole is not moving. So there should be almost no Doppler shift}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-24,3,288!2024-07-24,3,288-->
