The satellite completes an orbit in 69 years relative to distant stars. The orbiting direction of the satellite is prograde to that of the planet.

> Q1. (MCQ) The Moon rises later everyday by approximately how long?
>
> 1. 1 minute
> 2. 4 minutes
> 3. 1 hour
> 4. 2 hours
> 5. 3 hours
>
> - solution: {{3}}
> - explanation: {{Recall that the moonrise time corresponds to the lunar phase cycle. As the cycle resets every 29.5 days, the moonrise time also resets 29.5 days. A moonrise time "reset" happens when the moon rises later by a cumulative time of 1 day.

> Q1. (iPRS) Assume that the orbits of all planets in the solar system are circular. Then a = r = orbital radius. By Kepler's third law, p<sup>2</sup> ~ r<sup>3</sup>, the orbital speed v is
>
> 1. proportional to 1/r
> 2. proportional to r^(-1/2)

> - solution: {{2}}
> - explanation: {{The orbital period $p$ is proportional to the inverse of angular orbital velocity $1 / \omega$. Further, linear orbital velocity (speed) $v$ relates to angular orbital velocity by $v = r \omega \implies \omega = v / r$. Therefore, $$p^2 \propto r^3 \implies \omega^{-2} \propto r^3 \implies r^2 / v^2 \propto r^3 \implies r^{-1} \propto v^2 \implies v \propto r^{-1 / 2}$$. Therefore the answer is $v \propto r^{-1 / 2}$.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-31,10,301!2024-08-07,17,321-->

Plug in the numbers: $$v = \sqrt{\frac {9.8} {1000} \cdot 6400} = \sqrt{62.72} \approx 7.91959595\text{ km/s}$$. Therefore, the answer is 7.9 km/s.}} <!--SR:!2024-08-14,17,281!2024-07-30,9,281-->

> 5. 11 km/s
>
> - solution: {{2}}
> - explanation: {{Recall that the acceleration due to gravity is inversely proportional to the square of distance: $g \propto \frac 1 {r^2}$. Therefore, the acceleration due to gravity 400 km above the surface is: $$g = 9.8 \cdot \frac {6400^2} {6800^2} \approx 8.68096886\text{ m/s}$$. Now, equate circular acceleration to gravitational acceleration: $$a = g \implies \frac {v^2} r = g \implies v^2 = gr \implies v = \sqrt{gr}$$. Plug in the numbers: $$v = \sqrt{\frac {8.68096886} {1000} \cdot 6800} \approx 7.6831366\text{ km/s}$$. Therefore, the answer is 7.7 km/s.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-31,10,301!2024-08-01,11,301-->

> 4. blue in color
>
> - solution: {{2}}
> - explanation: {{Consider the graph of spectral radiance for that star, which peaks at 530 nm. It should look like a hill with somewhat narrow peak. However, the narrow peak should cover the entire visible spectrum. As the spectral radiance is approximately even around the peak, that means it is approximately even over the entire visible spectrum, so the color is white.}} <!--SR:!2024-08-04,7,288!2024-08-07,10,308-->

>
> - solution: {{5}}
> - explanation: {{Purple is the combination of red and blue. However, red and blue are on the two opposite ends of the visible spectrum, so the spectral radiance graph would need to have 2 peaks.

> Q1. (iPRS) From laboratory measurements, we know that a particular spectral line appears at a certain wavelength. The line width is very small and can be ignored. A star is moving with negligible velocity relative to the Earth but self-rotating very fast. Assume that the Earth lies on the equatorial plane of the star. What will be observed of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the star?

> 5. No width broadening but red-shifted.
> 6. No width broadening but blue-shifted.
>
> - solution: {{1}}
> - explanation: {{First, the star is not moving, so the spectral line should be unshifted. Now consider the surface of a very fast rotating star. In particular, consider the left and right sides of the rotating star. The surface of one side is approaching us very quickly, and that of the other side is moving away from us very quickly as well. This would mean part of the light from the star is blue-shifted and another part is red-shifted. The result is that the spectral line broadens.}} <!--SR:!2024-08-11,14,308!2024-08-16,19,328-->

> Q2. (derived) A binary star system consists of two stars orbiting each other. Assume a binary star system, with circular orbits, is not moving relative to Earth, and its orbital plane is parallel to that of Earth. When the system is dimmer than what it normally is, what are the detected Doppler shifts of the two stars?

> 4. red shift for both stars
> 5. blue shift for both stars
> 6. almost no shift for both stars
>
> - solution: {{6}}
> - explanation: {{When the system is dimmer than what it normally is, it implies one star is in front of the other star. Consider that both stars are always opposite in their orbits. So the stars must be in the part of the orbit closest to or farthest from Earth (this is true for circular orbits, but gets less true the more elliptic the orbits are). That means both stars are moving mostly transversal to Earth, taking into consideration that the system as a whole is not moving. So there should be almost no Doppler shift.}} <!--SR:!2024-08-10,13,308!2024-08-06,9,288-->

> Q1. (iPRS) The apparent magnitude of the Sun is −26.832. The apparent magnitude of the full moon is −12.74. The solar constant, measured to be 1370 W/m<sup>2</sup>, is the power of sunlight per unit area perpendicular to the rays, one astronomical unit from the Sun (roughly the distance from the Sun to the Earth).

> 5. 4.92 W/m^2
>
> - solution: {{2}}

Setup a trigonometric equation: $$\tan (\theta / 2) = \frac {5 / 2} d$$, where $d$ is the distance to the Great Wall (in meters). Since the angle is small, we can use small angle approximation to save work: $$\theta / 2 \approx \frac {5 / 2} d \implies \theta \approx \frac 5 d \implies d \approx \frac 5 \theta = \frac 5 {0.000203333333} \approx 24590.16~\mathrm{m} \approx 24.6~\mathrm{km}$$.

The main thing to realize is that w expect for masses in the boundary points between two equations, the two equations should predict the same value, i.e. a continuous function. We only need the $C$ for the third case: $$55^{3.5} = C \cdot 55^1 \implies C = 55^{2.5} \approx 22434.0004$$. Then the rest is a simple matter of applying the formula: $$L = 22434.0004 \cdot 100^1 \approx 2.24 \times 10^6~\mathrm{solar\ luminosity}$$.

As the apparent brightness is inversely proportional to the square of distance, the factor the Sun needs to be farther away is $$f_d = 1 / \sqrt{4.50401678 \times 10^{-8} } \approx 4711.9427$$. As the Sun is 1 AU away, the answer is about 4700 AU.}} <!--SR:!2024-08-01,4,291!2024-07-30,2,271-->

> Q5. (derived) Assume a telescope only observes light from the Sun that has a wavelength of 500 nm. What is the minimum aperture required so that the Sun's radius as measured by the telescope has a maximum error of 0.5 km? Ignore any other effects that may affect the result.

> - explanation: {{To have a maximum error of 0.5 km, the measurement interval is twice that: 1 km (primary school things). Calculate the angular size of 1 km from 1 AU away, using the small angle approximation: $$\theta \approx \frac {1000} {149\,597\,870\,700} \approx 6.68458712 \times 10^{-9}$$. This is the angular resolution required. Calculate the minimum aperture required using the Rayleigh criterion: $$\theta \approx 1.22 \frac \lambda D \implies D \approx 1.22 \frac \lambda \theta = 1.22 \frac {500 \times 10^{-9} } {6.68458712 \times 10^{-9} } \approx 91.254701~\mathrm{m}$$. So the answer is 90 m. That is a giant telescope indeed.}} <!--SR:!2024-08-16,19,331!2024-08-16,19,331-->

> Q6. (derived) An empirical model predicts some types of main sequence stars have a lifetime that is proportional to $M^{-3}$, where $M$ is its mass. Given that the Sun is one of said types of main sequence stars. How massive (referring to mass, not size) a star, also one of said types of main sequence stars, is predicted to be by the empirical model if its luminosity is 2147&nbsp;483&nbsp;647 times the solar luminosity?

> - solution: {{4}}
> - explanation: {{Assuming the fuel burnt is proportional to luminosity. Then, the lifetime of a star is: $$\tau = M / L \propto M^{-3}$$. Derive the proportionality between mass and luminosity: $$M / L \propto M^{-3} \implies M^4 \propto L \implies M \propto L^{0.25}$$. So the star mass is predicted to be: $$(2147\,483\,647)^{0.25} \approx 215.269482~\mathrm{solar\ masses}$$. So the answer is 220 solar masses.}} <!--SR:!2024-08-10,13,311!2024-08-08,11,311-->
