The parenthesized text at the beginning of of each question is {{the location the question appears in}}. Questions beginning with `(derived)` are {{derived from other questions and only appear here}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-02,4,277!2024-07-02,4,277-->

> Q1. (lecture) This photo shows the Andromeda Galaxy as it looked about 2.5 million years ago. (HISTORIC Photograph)
>
> Question: When will we be able to see what it looks like __now__?
>
> - solution: {{_About_ 2.5 million years later. Or less than 2.5 million years later, if you know that the Andromeda is approaching the Milky Way}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-17,17,290-->

> Q2. (iPRS) According to our definition, the look-back time of an object is
>
> 1. the age of the Universe when the light received by us now was first emitted from the object
> 2. the age of the Universe now minus the time taken for the light from the object to reach the Earth
> 3. the time elapsed between when we detect the light here on Earth and when it was originally emitted by the source
> 4. smaller for more distant objects
> 5. larger for nearer objects
>
> - solution: {{3}} <!--SR:!2024-07-16,16,290-->

> Q3. (MCQ) If you can count one star per second, how long will it take for you to count all stars in the observable universe?
>
> 1. 3 thousand years
> 2. 3 million years
> 3. 3 billion years
> 4. 3 trillion years
> 5. 3 hundred trillion years
>
> - solution: {{5}}
> - steps: {{Given there are about 10<sup>22</sup> stars, divide it by the number of seconds in a year: $$\frac {10^{22} } {86400 \times 365} \approx 3.17 \times 10^{14}\text{ years}$$ to get about 300 trillion (300 Ã— 10<sup>12</sup>) years.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-17,17,290!2024-07-10,10,270-->

> Q1. (iPRS) At what location(s) on the Earth will one see the stars, the Sun, and the Moon rise and set vertically (viz. perpendicular to the horizon)?
>
> 1. at the North Pole
> 2. at the South Pole
> 3. an the equator
> 4. on the prime meridian
> 5. 1 and 2
>
> - solution: {{3}} <!--SR:!2024-07-02,4,277-->

> Q2. (MCQ) A hypothetical planet has an orbital period around the Sun equal to 6 sidereal days of the planet. The self-rotation and orbital rotation are in the same direction. How long is its solar day?
>
> 1. 7/6 sidereal days
> 2. 6/5 sidereal days
> 3. 5/4 sidereal days
> 4. 4/3 sidereal days
> 5. 3/2 sidereal days
>
> - solution: {{2}}
> - steps: {{The planet is in prograde motion. Hence, the number of solar days per orbital period is $6 - 1 = 5\text{ solar days}$. Thus each solar day is $\frac {1 / 5} {1 / 6} = \frac 6 5\text{ sidereal days}$.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-02,4,277!2024-07-02,4,277-->

> Q3. (derived) At what location(s) on the Earth will one see the stars, the Sun, and the Moon move horizontally (viz. parallel to the horizon)?
>
> 1. at the North Pole
> 2. at the South Pole
> 3. an the equator
> 4. on the prime meridian
> 5. 1 and 2

> Q4. (derived) A hypothetical planet has an orbital period around its parent star equal to 42 solar days of the planet. The self-rotation and orbital rotation are in the opposite direction. How long is its sidereal day?
>
> 1. 43/44 solar days
> 2. 43/42 solar days
> 3. 42/41 solar days
> 4. 42/43 solar days
> 5. 41/42 solar days
> 6. 44/43 solar days
>
> - solution: {{3}}
> - steps: {{The planet is in retrograde motion. Hence, the number of sidereal days per orbital period is $42 - 1 = 41\text{ sidereal days}$. Thus each sidereal day is $\frac {1 / 41} {1 / 42} = \frac {42} {41}\text{ solar days}$.}} <!--SR:!2024-07-02,4,277!2024-07-02,4,277-->
