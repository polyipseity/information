> Q1. (lecture) This photo shows the Andromeda Galaxy as it looked about 2.5 million years ago. (HISTORIC Photograph)
>
> Question: When will we be able to see what it looks like __now__?
>
> - solution: {{About 2.5 million years later. Or less than 2.5 million years later, if you know that the Andromeda is approaching the Milky Way}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-30,4,270-->

> Q2. (iPRS) According to our definition, the look-back time of an object is
>
> 1. the age of the Universe when the light received by us now was first emitted from the object
> 2. the age of the Universe now minus the time taken for the light from the object to reach the Earth
> 3. the time elapsed between when we detect the light here on Earth and when it was originally emitted by the source
> 4. smaller for more distant objects
> 5. larger for nearer objects
>
> - solution: {{3}} <!--SR:!2024-06-30,4,270-->

> Q3. (MCQ) If you can count one star per second, how long will it take for you to count all stars in the observable universe?
>
> 1. 3 thousand years
> 2. 3 million years
> 3. 3 billion years
> 4. 3 trillion years
> 5. 3 hundred trillion years
>
> - solution: {{5}}
> - steps: {{Given there are about 10<sup>22</sup> stars, divide it by the number of seconds in a year: $$\frac {10^{22} } {86400 \times 365} \approx 3.17 \times 10^{14}\text{ years}$$ to get about 300 trillion (300 Ã— 10<sup>12</sup>) years.}} <!--SR:!2024-06-30,4,270!2024-06-30,4,270-->
