- [Cosmic Calendar](../../../../general/Cosmic%20Calendar.md) ::@:: Compress the entire history of the universe till now (13.8 billion years) into 1 year. 1 month ≈ 1.2 billion yrs, 1 day ≈ 40 million yrs, 1 sec ≈ 440 yrs <!--SR:!2025-05-15,227,288!2025-04-18,212,328-->
  - Cosmic Calendar highlights ::@:: The [Solar System](../../../../general/Solar%20System.md) formed on September. Dinosaurs appeared on Christmas (25 Dec) and extincted yesterday (30 Dec). All of recorded human history occurred in the last 30 seconds. We (age of ~20) were born 0.05 seconds before. <!--SR:!2025-10-01,307,288!2025-06-23,258,328-->
- Are we ever standing still? ::@:: No! Consider the movement of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md), the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), and [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md). <!--SR:!2025-04-01,199,328!2025-08-12,316,348-->
- movement of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::@:: [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md), [Earth's orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md), movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) <!--SR:!2025-11-10,348,308!2025-04-04,212,328-->
  - [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md) ::@:: [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) rotates on its axis once very day (~24 h). Its [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) is about 23.5°, pointing to [Polaris](../../../../general/Polaris.md). <!--SR:!2024-12-17,127,308!2025-09-15,342,348-->
  - [Earth's orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md) ::@:: [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) orbits the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) once a year at an average distance of 1 [AU](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md), in counterclockwise direction as viewed from above. <!--SR:!2025-06-24,259,328!2025-07-27,306,348-->
    - [astronomical unit](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md) ::@:: 1 [AU](../../../../general/astronomical%20unit.md) = 149&nbsp;597&nbsp;870&nbsp;700 m ≈ 150 million km <!--SR:!2024-12-28,40,208!2025-02-12,156,308-->
    - Earth's orbital speed ::@:: surprisingly quick, 29.78 km/s or 107&nbsp;200 km/h <!--SR:!2024-12-24,77,228!2025-02-19,161,308-->
  - Why do we not feel the movement of Earth even if it is moving very quickly? ::@:: Although Earth moves very quickly, its acceleration is very little. As we feel acceleration but not velocity, we do not feel the Earth moving. (Imagine riding on trains which are respectively accelerating, in constant velocity, and decelerating.) For [Earth's rotation](../../../../general/Earth's%20rotation.md), consider that the [angular velocity](../../../../general/angular%20velocity.md) is very small. <!--SR:!2025-03-20,183,308!2025-10-03,360,348-->
  - [angular velocity](../../../../general/angular%20velocity.md) ::@:: Angular velocity is $\omega = \frac {v_{\perp} } r$, where $v_{\perp}$ is the signed (+: counterclockwise, -: clockwise) magnitude of the tangential velocity and $r$ is the radius from the rotation center. <!--SR:!2025-10-10,367,348!2025-09-05,337,348-->
- movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) ::@:: [solar apex](../../../../general/solar%20apex.md), [orbit of the Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md#motion), movement of the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) <!--SR:!2025-03-09,174,308!2025-07-26,305,348-->
  - [solar apex § direction](../../../../general/solar%20apex.md#direction) ::@:: The [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) moves relative to the local solar neighborhood ([local standard of rest](../../../../general/local%20standard%20of%20rest.md)) at about 72&nbsp;000 km/h. (Actually, this was the measured speed before 1986, but we will use it here anyway.) <!--SR:!2025-02-24,163,308!2025-09-09,292,288-->
  - [orbit of the Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md#motion) ::@:: The [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) orbits around the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) center about every 230 million years at a speed of about 800&nbsp;000 km/h. <!--SR:!2026-02-05,431,308!2025-02-07,157,308-->
  - Why do we not notice the movement of the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) relative to the [stars](../../../../general/star.md) even if it is moving extremely quickly? ::@:: This is because the distance between [stars](../../../../general/star.md) is even larger. In a 1:10<sup>10</sup> model, the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)'s speed 70&nbsp;000 km/h is 0.7 cm/h. Compare this to the scaled distance of 4400 km (4.4 ly) between the Sun and [Alpha Centauri](../../../../general/Alpha%20Centauri.md). One implication is that stars appear to be stationary over lifetimes of many generations, allowing the concept of [constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md). <!--SR:!2025-05-09,227,328!2025-10-10,365,348-->
- [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) fun fact ::@:: While most of the light come from the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md)'s bulge and disk, most of its mass is in its halo. ([dark matter](../../../../general/dark%20matter.md)) <!--SR:!2025-01-21,144,308!2025-08-13,322,348-->

  - [Hubble's law](../../../../general/Hubble's%20law.md) ::@:: Attributed to [Edwin Hubble](../../../../general/Edwin%20Hubble.md). All [galaxies](../../../../general/galaxy.md) outside our [Local Group](../../../../general/Local%20Group.md) are moving away from us, with the speeds proportional to their distances. <!--SR:!2025-06-23,256,328!2025-04-18,223,328-->
    - Hubble's law implications ::@:: An evidence for the [expansion of the universe](../../../../general/expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md). Consider [raisins](../../../../general/raisin.md) (galaxies) in a rising loaf of bread (the universe). Raisins further apart from each other move away from each other faster. <!--SR:!2025-05-14,231,328!2025-08-27,329,348-->
- recurring patterns on [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::@:: day: circling sky, month: phases of the [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md), year: 4 seasons <!--SR:!2025-03-26,195,333!2025-04-01,211,333-->
- How does the [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) look like from [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) using the naked eye? ::@:: We can see more than 2000 [stars](../../../../general/star.md) as well as the [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md). (Unfortunately, due to light pollution, many [stars](../../../../general/star.md) cannot be seen from [Hong Kong](../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md).) <!--SR:!2026-04-27,506,333!2025-04-16,221,333-->
- [constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md) ::@:: A region of the sky. There are 88 of them. Most names come from the imagination of ancient people. They are now used as landmarks by modern [astronomers](../../../../general/astronomer.md). <!--SR:!2024-12-30,135,313!2025-08-26,329,353-->
- [asterism](../../../../general/asterism%20(astronomy).md) ::@:: An observed pattern of [stars](../../../../general/star.md) in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md). More general than [constellations](../../../../general/constellation.md). <!--SR:!2025-04-20,227,333!2025-01-28,164,333-->

  - the [Big Dipper](../../../../general/Big%20Dipper.md) ::@:: It consists of the 7 brightest stars of the constellation [Ursa Major](../../../../general/Ursa%20Major.md). (Also known as BeiDou (Chinese: 北斗). The [BeiDou](../../../../general/BeiDou.md) Navigation Satellite System (BDS) is named after it.) <!--SR:!2025-04-30,232,333!2025-01-24,147,313-->
- Are stars in an asterism or constellation of the same cluster and similar distance? ::@:: No! They can very far apart from each other, like many light-years away. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,173,313!2025-08-16,320,353-->
- motion of the [stars](../../../../general/star.md) ::@:: They go around us once per day, like how the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md) rises and sets. <!--SR:!2025-10-11,366,353!2025-02-27,171,313-->

  - Why do stars appear to be fixed on the celestial sphere? And what are the exceptions? ::@:: Even if the stars (Chinese: 恆星 for 'unmoving star') are moving very quickly (described in km/s), their distances to us are even higher (described in ly), so they _appear_ fixed. The [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md), the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), and [planets](../../../../general/planet.md) (Chinese: 行星 for 'moving star') are much closer and moves slowly (but detectable to naked eyes) on the sphere. <!--SR:!2026-05-16,519,333!2025-06-15,274,353-->

  - [diurnal motion](../../../../general/diurnal%20motion.md)
  - What do the [constellations](../../../../general/constellation.md) we see depend on? ::@:: One is the [latitude](../../../../general/latitude.md), as it determines the [horizon](../../../../general/horizon.md), and thus visible and hidden [stars](../../../../general/star.md). The other one is the time of year, because the [Sun](Sun.md) moves along the [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md) on the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) and stars are only visible at nighttime away from the Sun. <!--SR:!2025-11-23,375,317!2025-09-30,306,297-->
  - [circumpolar star](../../../../general/circumpolar%20star.md) ::@:: [Stars](../../../../general/star.md) that never sets below the [horizon](../../../../general/horizon.md), as observed from a specific location on [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). <!--SR:!2025-11-04,383,357!2025-03-07,176,317-->

    - zodiac § [Ophiuchus](../../../../general/Ophiuchus.md) ::@:: The feet of [Ophiuchus](../../../../general/Ophiuchus.md) touches the [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md) and is in between [Sagittarius](../../../../general/Sagittarius%20(constellation).md) and [Scorpius](../../../../general/Scorpius.md), but is not in the 12 [zodiac signs](../../../../general/astrological%20sign.md). (Note that zodiac signs do not actually correspond to the [constellation](../../../../general/constellation.md) boundaries in general, due to the [axial precession](../../../../general/axial%20precession.md) of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). Thus, it is not the "13th zodiac sign"). <!--SR:!2026-01-23,422,317!2025-09-29,306,297-->
    - [astrological sign](../../../../general/astrological%20sign.md) ::@:: [Pseudoscience](../../../../general/pseudoscience.md). The 12 signs are named after 12 of the [constellations](../../../../general/constellation.md) touching the [ecliptic](../../../../general/ecliptic.md). Note that the time of the signs do not correspond with the positions of the constellations in general. <!--SR:!2024-12-26,131,317!2025-04-20,208,337-->
- [solar time](../../../../general/solar%20time.md) ::@:: Similar to the "time" we are familiar with. It is based on the [position of the Sun](../../../../general/position%20of%20the%20Sun.md) in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md). <!--SR:!2025-01-18,151,317!2025-03-14,196,337-->
  - [solar day](../../../../general/synodic%20day.md) ::@:: About 24 hours for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). Similar to the "day" we are familiar with. The time between two occurrences of the same [position of the Sun](../../../../general/position%20of%20the%20Sun.md) in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md). <!--SR:!2025-02-07,158,317!2025-02-16,171,317-->
- [sidereal time](../../../../general/sidereal%20time.md) ::@:: Not the "time" we are familiar with. It is based on the positions of the [fixed stars](../../../../general/fixed%20stars.md). <!--SR:!2025-08-14,318,357!2025-05-04,239,337-->
  - sidereal day ::@:: About 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md). Not the "day" we are familiar with. The time it takes for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) to rotate 360° around its own axis. Usually uses the positions of [fixed stars](../../../../general/fixed%20stars.md) as reference. <!--SR:!2024-12-18,126,317!2025-09-08,341,357-->
    - implications of the sidereal day being shorter than solar day for [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) ::@:: Every (solar) day, stars appear in the same position in the [sky](../../../../general/sky.md) almost 3 minutes 56 seconds earlier. <!--SR:!2026-01-27,423,317!2025-06-04,245,337-->
  - [§ comparison to solar time](../../../../general/sidereal%20time.md#comparison%20to%20solar%20time) ::@:: Solar day and sidereal day lengths are different. For most planets, which are in [prograde motion](../../../../general/retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) (the [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) spins in the same direction as its orbital direction), the solar day is longer than the sidereal day. Consider a planet and a point on the planet initially facing its parent star. Consider after it has spined 360°, corresponding to a sidereal day. In that time, the planet has progressed in the orbit as well, thus the direction of the parent star has also advanced in the spinning direction. So more time is needed for the point to "catch up" so that it faces the parent star again. Thus, a solar day is longer than the sidereal day. Uncommonly, if the motion is retrograde instead, then reverse the above argument to get the conclusion that a solar day is shorter than a sidereal day. <!--SR:!2025-02-13,168,317!2026-01-26,422,317-->
  - [§ sidereal days compared to solar days on other planets](../../../../general/sidereal%20time.md#sidereal%20days%20compared%20to%20solar%20days%20on%20other%20planets) ::@:: For [prograde motion](../../../../general/retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) (the [planet](../../../../general/planet.md) spins in the same direction as its orbital direction, which is true for most planets), the formula is $$\text{number of solar days per orbital period} = \text{number of sidereal days per orbital period} - 1$$. For retrograde motion, the formula is $$\text{number of solar days per orbital period} = \text{number of sidereal days per orbital period} + 1$$. The length formulas can easily be derived from above. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,196,337!2025-03-03,186,337-->
- [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md)
  - [axial parallelism](../../../../general/axial%20parallelism.md) ::@:: Ignoring [axial precession](../../../../general/axial%20precession.md) (which are long-term minor variations in the [rotation axis](../../../../general/rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md)), [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s [rotation axis](../../../../general/rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md) remains fixed. That is, the [North Pole](../../../../general/North%20Pole.md) always point to the [Polaris](../../../../general/Polaris.md). <!--SR:!2025-08-13,300,341!2025-08-27,331,360-->

- [season](../../../../general/season.md)
  - [§ axial parallelism](../../../../general/season.md#axial%20parallelism)
  - [§ axial tilt](../../../../general/season.md#axial%20tilt)
  - season [§ elliptical Earth orbit](../../../../general/season.md#elliptical%20Earth%20orbit) ::@:: The [Earth orbit](../../../../general/Earth's%20orbit.md) being elliptical does not affect the seasons much. As the Earth's [orbital distance](../../../../general/semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes.md) varies by about 3%, sunlight received varies by only about 7%. (In fact, the Earth is farther away in the [summer](../../../../general/summer.md) for the [Northern Hemisphere](../../../../general/Northern%20Hemisphere.md).) For the same reason, some parts of the [Earth's surface](geoid.md) being closer or farther (but not angle of the surface) due to [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) also does not contribute much, considering the distance difference—up to only thousands of [kilometers](../../../../general/kilometre.md)—is even smaller. Both effects are overwhelmed by the effect of axial parallelism and axial tilt. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,179,281!2025-06-23,258,341-->
- [surface power density](../../../../general/surface%20power%20density.md) ::@:: [power](../../../../general/power%20(physics).md) per unit [area](../../../../general/area.md), e.g. [solar irradiance](../../../../general/solar%20irradiance.md) <!--SR:!2025-09-27,354,360!2025-08-16,320,360-->
  - [solar irradiance](../../../../general/solar%20irradiance.md), solar flux ::@:: The [power](../../../../general/power%20(physics).md) per unit [area](../../../../general/area.md) ([surface power density](../../../../general/surface%20power%20density.md)) received from the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md), typically measured in [watts](../../../../general/watt.md) per [square meter](../../../../general/square%20metre.md) (W/m<sup>2</sup>) in [SI units](../../../../general/International%20System%20of%20Units.md). <!--SR:!2025-11-16,395,361!2025-07-30,308,360-->
    - [solar flux](../../../../general/solar%20irradiance.md) & [axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) ::@:: [Axial tilt](../../../../general/axial%20tilt.md) makes the [sunlight](../../../../general/sunlight.md) not necessarily hit the surface [perpendicularly](../../../../general/perpendicular.md). When it is not perpendicular, the same amount of sunlight is spread over a larger surface area. This effect can be approximated as: $$\text{solar flux} = \text{solar power} \cdot \cos \theta$$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the [normal](../../../../general/normal%20(geometry).md) of the surface and the direction of solar radiation. <!--SR:!2025-11-10,389,360!2025-11-04,383,360-->
- [analemma](../../../../general/analemma.md)
  - [analemma](../../../../general/analemma.md) & [season](../../../../general/season.md) ::@:: The [analemma](../../../../general/analemma.md) at [noon](../../../../general/noon.md) shows the [Sun](../../../../general/Sun.md)'s altitude on the [celestial sphere](../../../../general/celestial%20sphere.md) at noon in any particular day of the year. Higher altitude means the [sunlight](../../../../general/sunlight.md) is more direct, so it is [summer](../../../../general/summer.md). Conversely, lower altitude means the sunlight is less direct, so it is [winter](../../../../general/winter.md). <!--SR:!2025-05-10,205,280!2025-08-26,330,360-->
  - analemma direction ::@:: The Sun moves eastward on the analemma near the solstices (the top and bottom of the 8 figure). <!--SR:!2024-12-25,53,337!2025-01-16,139,355-->

- [sun path](../../../../general/sun%20path.md) ::@:: Identify today's Sun position on the ecliptic. Then draw a circle passing through that position and parallel to the celestial equator. This is the path the Sun (roughly) takes on that day. According to the ecliptic, the Sun position oscillates around the celestial equator _over a year_. Then one can see how the path the Sun takes _over a day_ oscillates over a year. By this, one can also see how altitude of the Sun and daytime length change. <!--SR:!2025-02-13,167,337!2025-07-24,280,355-->
  - sun path at polar regions ::@:: On some days, the circle over a day does not go below or above the horizon. <!--SR:!2025-08-15,302,357!2025-07-11,290,355-->
  - sun path at tropics ::@:: The Sun is not at the highest altitude on the celestial sphere for both solstices, unlike locations at temperate latitudes. On the equator, the Sun is at the highest altitude during the equinoxes instead. <!--SR:!2025-12-27,430,377!2025-05-01,218,337-->

  - [Tropic of Cancer § name](../../../../general/Tropic%20of%20Cancer.md#name) ::@:: It was named after the constellation Cancer during last centuries BCE, as the Sun was there on the June solstice. Due to westward precession of the equinoxes, this is no longer the case. The current constellation is Gemini. <!--SR:!2025-07-04,269,355!2025-07-08,273,355-->

- 4 [seasons](season.md) as we know it ::@:: The 4 seasons as we know it only happen at temperate latitudes. For tropics (latitudes in between the tropics), the seasons become the _dry season_ and the _wet season_, or may not exist at all like in alpines and deserts. For polar regions (latitudes in the Arctic or Antarctic Circle), the sun does not set on some days during the "summer", and does not rise for some days during the "winter". This is apparent when considering the sun path oscillation, restricted to the visible parts of the celestial sphere. <!--SR:!2025-05-28,223,315!2025-04-03,191,337-->
- [axial precession](../../../../general/axial%20precession.md) ::@:: The orientation of Earth's axis of rotation gradually shifts westward (opposite of the Earth's direction of rotation) in a circle over a period of about 26&nbsp;000 years. <!--SR:!2025-11-20,399,379!2025-07-31,287,359-->
  - axial precession effects ::@:: One effect is that the celestial poles points at a different direction, changing the pole stars (e.g. the north star will eventually no longer be Polaris). The other is that the constellations the Sun's projection is on during the equinoxes and solstices shifts westward along the zodiac. <!--SR:!2025-09-18,327,357!2025-10-13,345,357-->

  - [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) / [tidal locking](../../../../general/tidal%20locking.md) (misnomer: synchronous orbit) ::@:: The orbital period equals the rotation period. That means the same near side is always exposed to the Earth. The far side is also called the "dark side of the Moon". <!--SR:!2025-02-20,159,319!2025-10-15,349,359-->
  - [lunar phase](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md) ::@:: Cycles once every lunar month, which is about 29.5 days, which is the same as the synodic rotation period. Caused by changing relative orbital positions of the Moon, Earth, and the Sun, as the Moon orbits around Earth and Earth orbits around the Sun. Half of the Moon is always sunlit (the side facing the Sun), but as the visible side (the side facing the Earth) shifts relative to the sunlit side, so the portion of visible side that is sunlit changes. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,197,359!2025-04-07,214,359-->

      - [lunar phase § principal and intermediate phases of the Moon](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md#principal%20and%20intermediate%20phases%20of%20the%20Moon) / memorization ::@:: New moon and full moon are easily remembered. Then insert the 2 quarters, first quarter and third quarter, respectively in between new moon and full moon, and in between full moon and next new moon. Finally, in between each of the 4 phases, including between third quarter and next new moon, insert the 4 minor phases. The 4 minor phases is a word combination of waxing or waning, and crescent or gibbous. Waxing means "increasing" while waning means "decreasing". Crescent means "sickle moon" while gibbous means "convex" or "protuberant", so the former is thinner than the latter. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,166,319!2025-03-29,208,359-->
    - [lunar phase](../../../../general/lunar%20phase.md) / moonrise and moonset ::@:: Each day, the Moon advances in its orbit slightly, delaying moonrise and moonset daily by about 50 minutes. The moonrise and moonset times correspond to the moon phases, and resets every lunar month. <!--SR:!2025-07-05,284,359!2025-09-02,317,359-->

- [orbital period § synodic period](../../../../general/orbital%20period.md#synodic%20period) ::@:: It is the orbital period of a body orbiting a second body, using a third body as the reference. (The second body and the third body can be the same.) It is also the time between [conjunctions](conjunction%20(astronomy).md) of the second body and the third body as viewed from the first body. For observers on [Earth](Earth.md), the usual reference (third body) is the [Sun](Sun.md). <!--SR:!2025-06-28,263,319!2025-10-16,348,359-->
  - [orbital period § synodic period](../../../../general/orbital%20period.md#synodic%20period) / calculation ::@:: For 2 bodies orbiting in the same direction, $$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} - \frac 1 {T_2} \qquad T_1 < T_2$$. For 2 bodies orbiting in opposing direction, $$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} + \frac 1 {T_2}$$. <!--SR:!2026-01-02,436,379!2025-10-01,358,379-->

Finally, the data was interpreted by Johannes Kepler and developed his 3 laws of planetary motion to explain the data. <!--SR:!2025-02-09,146,334!2025-11-08,357,372-->

  - Why do we not need the motion of [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md) even if it is moving quickly? ::@:: Because we feel acceleration, not motion. It turns out Earth's acceleration (about 0.0059 m/s<sup>2</sup>) is too little to notice. <!--SR:!2025-08-06,300,374!2025-05-03,228,374-->
- [Tycho Brahe](../../../../general/Tycho%20Brahe.md) ::@:: A Danish astronomer known for his comprehensive and unprecedentedly accurate astronomical observations (...with the naked eye! As telescopes were not invented yet...). His observations, particularly Mars, disagreed with predictions of the existing perfect heliocentric model. <!--SR:!2025-02-05,142,332!2025-04-15,196,352-->

  - [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](../../../../general/Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) / the physics behind ::@:: The physics behind is [Newton's laws of motion](Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md), proposed about 60 years later. <!--SR:!2025-10-18,359,374!2025-09-15,329,372-->

- [Galileo Galilei](../../../../general/Galileo%20Galilei.md) ::@:: He overcame 3 key objections rooted in the Aristotelian view: Earth could not be moving as objects would be left behind, non-circular orbits are not "perfect" as the heavens should be, and stellar parallax should have been detected. He also provided 2 key observations using the newly invented telescope. <!--SR:!2025-09-12,330,374!2025-04-04,190,354-->
  - countering "Earth could not be moving as objects would be left behind" ::@:: Aristotle's belief that all objects naturally come to rest is wrong. Moving objects stay in motion unless an external force acts to slow them down (Newton's laws of motion). Further, we do not feel motion, just as we do not feel a ship is moving or a rest when sitting inside a cabin, so that there are no visual clues that tells us the conditions of the ship (equivalence principle). <!--SR:!2025-05-06,224,354!2026-02-01,456,394-->
  - countering "non-circular orbits are not 'perfect' as the heavens should be" ::@:: Tycho's observations of comets and supernovas demonstrated the heavens are imperfect. Galileo also observed sunspots on the Sun (the Sun is imperfect), and mountains and valleys on the Moon (the Moon is not a perfect sphere). <!--SR:!2026-02-25,474,394!2025-09-19,336,374-->
  - countering "stellar parallax should have been detected" ::@:: Tycho thought his naked-eye observations should detect stellar parallax for distances he thought the stars were located at. Galileo showed that the stars are even farther away than Tycho thought, so not detecting stellar parallax is okay. He observed that the Milky Way has many stars using his telescope, partially demonstrating the stars' extreme distances. <!--SR:!2025-08-14,297,374!2026-03-23,492,394-->

    - [Galilean Moons](../../../../general/Galilean%20Moons.md) / influence on [Galileo Galilei](../../../../general/Galileo%20Galilei.md) ::@:: Galileo observed the moons and reasoned that the Moon can orbit Earth instead of the Sun, just as there are moons orbiting Jupiter. <!--SR:!2025-02-18,164,354!2025-06-17,260,372-->
  - [phases of Venus](../../../../general/phases%20of%20Venus.md) ::@:: They are the variations of lighting seen on the planet's surface, similar to lunar phases. Galileo observed a full set of phases. However, according to the Ptolemaic model, Venus can only show a crescent phase as Venus is always in between Earth and the Sun. This is better explained by a heilocentric model. <!--SR:!2025-05-22,226,354!2025-05-24,228,354-->
  - angular size of Venus ::@:: The change in angular size of Venus (about 10 to 58 arcseconds) is too extreme to be explained by the Ptolemaic model but easily explained by a heliocentric model. <!--SR:!2025-05-02,156,254!2025-01-30,142,334-->

  - [gravity of Earth](../../../../general/gravity%20of%20Earth.md) ::@:: An example of acceleration. All falling objects, regardless of their masses, on Earth accelerate at $g \approx 9.81\text{ m/s}^2 \approx 10\text{ m/s}^2$; that is, the speed increases by $g$ per second of falling. Note that this neglects the effect of air resistance. (See the demonstration of a feather and hammer falling on the Moon during the Apollo 15 mission, which has no atmospheres.) <!--SR:!2026-03-12,483,394!2025-12-24,423,394-->

    - [classical element § Aristotle](../../../../general/classical%20element.md#Aristotle) / classical element properties ::@:: Earth is _naturally_ the center of the universe. Then other elements, in the order of (earth, then) water, air, and fire, _naturally_ surrounds it in multiple layers of circles. Heavenly element is not surrounded by a circle, as it is the outermost element. The first 4 elements are earthy elements, which returns to their _natural_ positions _naturally_. Quintessence performs perpetual circular motion. That means earthly objects would _naturally_ come to rest without any force applied. <!--SR:!2025-09-27,313,334!2025-10-17,340,374-->
  - [classical element § Aristotle](../../../../general/classical%20element.md#Aristotle) / motion properties ::@:: There exists a natural state of "no motion", being at rest. At rest is special because all earthy elements eventually come to rest. Thus, at rest and moving can be distinguished. People should be able to notice whether they are at rest or moving. Particularly, Earth is at rest in the geocentric model. <!--SR:!2026-02-18,468,394!2025-06-19,262,374-->

    - Why do we feel acceleration but not uniform motion? ::@:: If we can feel uniform motion, that means we can distinguish undergoing uniform motion versus being at rest. Yet both frames of references are inertial as there is no acceleration, which by Galilean invariance, should not be distinguishable. So we cannot feel uniform motion. But acceleration can be felt as the frame of reference is no longer inertial. <!--SR:!2025-05-17,221,354!2026-02-01,456,392-->
  - [Galileo's ship § 1632 thought experiment](../../../../general/Galileo's%20ship.md#1632%20thought%20experiment) ::@:: In short: You are in a cabin of a ship, without any windows (cannot look at the outside world). There are many things going on in the cabin. Imagine two scenarios: the ship is not moving, and the ship is moving in uniform motion (no acceleration). In both scenarios, you observe things going on in the cabin. You would see everything goes on the same way whether the ship is moving or not. Therefore, there is no way to distinguish between uniform motion or being at rest without looking outside. Being in uniform motion is undetectable. <!--SR:!2026-02-09,461,394!2025-01-07,122,334-->
- [friction](../../../../general/friction.md)
  - Why do things come to rest spontaneously in our everyday lives? ::@:: It is due to friction. It is the force resisting relative lateral motion of contact surfaces of two objects. The origin of friction is the microscopic interactions of particles between the two surfaces. <!--SR:!2025-10-17,341,374!2026-03-18,488,394-->
  - How to make things move longer? ::@:: If friction is reduced, objects can move for a longer time, such as using an air cushion. If it is eliminated, objects can move forever, but we do not have perfectly frictionless surface in our everyday lives. <!--SR:!2025-09-12,330,374!2026-03-24,493,394-->
  - [friction](../../../../general/friction.md) / Galileo's thought experiment ::@:: Assume there is a ball moving on a perfectly frictionless track. Say the track goes down and then up. The ball will go up to the original height if the track goes back up high enough. If the track does not go back high enough, then it will roll forever. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,460,394!2025-11-06,383,394-->

  - How has Newton's laws of motion changed our view of the universe? ::@:: He realized that physical laws are the same regardless if they happen on Earth or in space. Before Newton, orbital mechanics (Kepler's laws of planetary motion) and terrestrial mechanics (constant acceleration towards Earth, principle of inertia) seemed to be two separate mechanics. After Newton, we realized they are actually based on the same laws of physics. An example is circular orbit. <!--SR:!2025-09-13,331,374!2025-10-08,334,374-->

  - [unification of theories in physics § unification of gravity and astronomy](../../../../general/unification%20of%20theories%20in%20physics.md) / examples ::@:: Take circular orbits. It turns out celestial objects perform circular orbits due to gravitational force, the same force responsible for making everyday things fall down to the ground. In fact, we can equate the equations to solve for the centripetal acceleration $a$: $$a = F / m = GMm / {mr^2} = GM / r^2 = g$$, which is the same as the [gravitational acceleration](../../../../general/gravitational%20acceleration.md). <!--SR:!2025-09-01,308,374!2026-02-08,456,394-->
- [Kepler orbit](../../../../general/Kepler%20orbit.md) ::@:: In increasing energy: circle, ellipsis, parabola, hyperbola. The former two are bounded, meaning orbiting objects return to the same position periodically. The latter two are unbounded, meaning the object does not return, and has nonnegative velocity at infinitely far away. Parabola is the boundary between bounded and unbounded orbits, where the object has exactly zero velocity at infinitely far away, and always equals the escape velocity at every point of its trajectory. <!--SR:!2026-02-10,461,394!2025-05-13,217,354-->

- [mass](../../../../general/mass.md) ::@:: There are multiple definitions, different conceptually but physically equivalent. Traditionally, it was believed to be the quantity of matter. The SI unit is kg. <!--SR:!2025-06-22,265,372!2026-03-21,490,392-->

- [apparent weight](../../../../general/apparent%20weight.md) ::@:: It is how heavy an object _appears_ to be. Most of the time, this is the ground reaction force. When one is stationary, then the force of gravity are balanced by the ground reaction force, so apparent weight equals weight. However, they are different whenever the force of gravity is not balanced by the reaction force, such as in an accelerating lift, or free falling. <!--SR:!2025-10-16,358,372!2025-12-29,427,394-->
  - [apparent weight](../../../../general/apparent%20weight.md) / [weightlessness](../../../../general/weightlessness.md) examples ::@:: This also means a "weightless" astronaut in low Earth orbit has an apparent weight of zero (the astronaut is free falling), but has almost the same weight as he would have while standing on the ground. Another daily life example is an accelerating lift. The lift accelerating upwards makes you feel heavier, and vice versa. If the lift accelerates downward at the same rate as the gravitational acceleration, then you are free falling and would feel "weightless", like the astronaut example just now. <!--SR:!2026-02-22,471,394!2026-03-08,480,394-->

  - momentum & force ::@:: For an object of fixed mass $m$, net force is also the change in momentum with respect to time: $$\frac {\mathrm d \mathbf p} {\mathrm dt} = m \frac {\mathrm d \mathbf v} {\mathrm dt} = m \mathbf a = \mathbf F$$. <!--SR:!2025-11-01,352,374!2026-03-07,479,392-->
  - [momentum § conservation](../../../../general/momentum.md#conservation) ::@:: In a closed system (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces), the total momentum (by summing up the momentum of each object over all objects) remains constant. No matter how complex the interactions internal to the closed system are, this law holds. <!--SR:!2025-06-05,254,374!2025-10-31,351,374-->
  - [momentum](../../../../general/momentum.md) / rotational analog ::@:: Its rotation analog is [angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md), which is also [conserved](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md#conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum) in a closed system. <!--SR:!2025-06-16,242,354!2025-03-10,172,354-->
- [angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md) ::@:: $$\mathbf L = \mathbf r \times \mathbf p = m \cdot \mathbf r \times \mathbf v$$, where $\mathbf L$ is the angular momentum, $\mathbf r$ is the position vector, $\mathbf p$ is the momentum, $m$ is the mass, $\mathbf v$ is the velocity. <!--SR:!2026-02-01,456,394!2026-02-11,462,392-->
  - [angular momentum § conservation of angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md#conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum) ::@:: In a closed system (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces), letting a position as the origin, the total angular momentum (by summing up the angular momentum of each object over all objects) remains constant. No matter how complex the interactions internal to the closed system are, this law holds. <!--SR:!2025-02-21,169,354!2026-01-30,448,392-->
    - [angular momentum § conservation of angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md#conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum) / examples ::@:: Like how force is the change in linear momentum, torque (twisting force) is the change in angular momentum. A force perpendicular to the line joining the center and the object produces torque, whereas one parallel does not. In a circular or elliptical orbit, with the primary body as center, as the gravitational force always point to the center, so it is always parallel to the line joining the center and the object. No torque is produced, and thus the angular momentum is conserved. Intuitively, the increase or decrease in orbital velocity is counteracted by the decrease or increase in the distance to the primary body, conserving angular momentum. Another example is that ice-skaters spin faster when they retract their hands, which works by the same intuition. <!--SR:!2025-05-28,246,372!2025-01-30,149,352-->

  - [conservation of energy](../../../../general/conservation%20of%20energy.md) ::@:: The total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time. But energy can be transferred from one object to another object, both in the isolated system. It can also change in form. <!--SR:!2025-07-29,299,372!2026-02-07,455,394-->

- [thermal energy](../../../../general/thermal%20energy.md) ::@:: A measure of total kinetic and potential energy of all particles in a substance. Therefore, it depends on both the temperature, the measure of average kinetic energy, and density of the substance. That means something having a higher temperature than the other thing does not imply its thermal energy is higher. <!--SR:!2025-09-07,313,374!2025-04-02,188,352-->
  - [temperature](../../../../general/temperature.md) ::@:: A physical quantity describing hotness and coldness. Elementarily, temperature can be thought of as the average kinetic energy of particles. Its units are usually degree Celsius (°C) and and Kelvin (K).

- [mechanical energy § satellite](../../../../general/mechanical%20energy.md#satellite) ::@:: The mechanical energy (total orbital energy), that is the sum of kinetic and potential energy, stays constant. It explains why an orbiting body, given no external energy transfer, being closer to the primary body implies higher velocity, and vice versa. <!--SR:!2026-07-08,580,405!2026-04-15,510,405-->
  - changing an [orbit](../../../../general/orbit.md) ::@:: External energy will need to be given or taken away from the mechanical energy, which is constant otherwise, to change the orbit. For example, atmospheric or friction drag, and gravitational encounter can change the mechanical energy, thus the orbit. <!--SR:!2026-03-10,482,405!2026-03-19,489,405-->
- [escape velocity](../../../../general/escape%20velocity.md) ::@:: the minimum speed required to escape into an unbounded orbit at a certain distance from the center of the primary body (ignoring friction): $$v_{\text{escape} } = \sqrt{\frac {2GM} r}$$ <!--SR:!2025-11-21,367,385!2025-10-22,345,385-->
  - [escape velocity](../../../../general/escape%20velocity.md) / [Earth](../../../../general/Earth.md)'s [surface](../../../../general/geoid.md) ::@:: about 11.2 km/s at sea level <!--SR:!2025-01-04,96,345!2026-01-28,419,385-->
- [tide](../../../../general/tide.md) ::@:: periodic variation in sea level, with two tides per day <!--SR:!2026-02-11,460,405!2026-04-18,512,405-->
  - [tide](../../../../general/tide.md) / amplitude ::@:: Usually in the order of 0.1 m to 1 m. The world's largest tidal range of 17 m (56 ft) occurs at in the Bay of Fundy, Eastern Canada. <!--SR:!2025-06-21,230,345!2025-06-21,242,365-->
  - [tide](../../../../general/tide.md) / contributions ::@:: tidal force of the Moon, and the tidal force of the Sun, which is about one third as strong as that of the Moon <!--SR:!2026-03-06,479,405!2025-11-03,354,385-->
  - [tidal force](../../../../general/tidal%20force.md) ::@:: a gravitational effect that stretches an object along the line towards and away from the center of mass of the other object due to spatial variations in the gravitational field strength; a _differential force_ <!--SR:!2025-08-25,312,385!2025-11-10,375,385-->
    - [tidal force § explanation](../../../../general/tidal%20force.md#explanation) ::@:: Consider a sphere falling onto Earth. Consider 5 points of the sphere: its center of mass, the point farthest away from Earth, the point nearest to Earth, and the 2 points on the sideways. The gravitational accelerations of those 5 points are: downward, downward but weaker, downward but stronger, and downward but slightly sideways towards the center. Now, place ourself in the center-of-mass frame, and compute the relative accelerations of the above 5 points by subtracting the acceleration of the center of mass. Then, the relative accelerations of the above 5 points are: zero, upward, downward, and sideways approximately towards the center. These are the tidal forces. It is also clear why this is a _differential force_. <!--SR:!2026-07-07,579,405!2025-04-14,202,365-->
    - [spaghettification](../../../../general/spaghettification.md), noodle effect ::@:: When the tidal forces are extreme enough, such as near a black hole, objects can become long thin shapes like spaghetti, hence the name. (For super massive black holes, one needs to well within the event horizon for spaghettification to happen.) <!--SR:!2026-03-31,500,405!2025-06-30,253,365-->
  - [tide § equilibrium](../../../../general/tide.md#equilibrium) ::@:: Assuming an idealized non-rotating landless Earth, the ocean would elongate in the direction of the attracting body (Moon or Sun), also known as the __equilibrium tide__. <p> The rotation of Earth does not affect the equilibrium tide. So each day has about two tides. <p> However, it rotates the actual tide eastward away from the equilibrium tide, causing the attracting body to pull the actual tide back to the equilibrium tide (or equivalently by Newton's third law, the actual tide pulls the Moon ahead to orbit faster temporarily). This is responsible for tidal dissipation. <!--SR:!2026-06-21,565,405!2026-02-16,464,405-->
  - [tide § range variation: springs and neaps](../../../../general/tide.md#range%20variation%20springs%20and%20neaps) ::@:: Highest tides when the Moon is in the new moon or full moon phase, as the tidal forces of the Sun and the Moon reinforce each other. Lowest tides when the Moon is at the first quarter or third quarter phase, as the weaker tidal forces of the Sun partially cancels that of the Moon. <!--SR:!2026-04-16,511,405!2025-06-16,242,365-->
  - [tide § dissipation](../../../../general/tide.md#dissipation) ::@:: As the actual tide is ahead of the equilibrium, the Moon pulls the actual tide back to the equilibrium, so Earth rotates increasing slowly. Or equivalently by Newton's third law, the actual tide pulls the Moon ahead to orbit faster, so the Moon orbits faster (temporarily; afterwards, the Moon's orbital radius increases, so the Moon's average orbital velocity actually decreases instead). This is known as tidal acceleration. <!--SR:!2025-10-21,359,385!2025-12-14,406,385-->
- [orbit of the Moon](../../../../general/orbit%20of%20the%20Moon.md) / center ::@:: It turns out the Moon does not simply orbit around Earth. More accurately, they are orbiting each other about their common center of mass called the barycenter, which is 4670 km from Earth's center (about 73% of its radius, so within Earth). This is actually true of any other orbits, because the primary body and the orbiting body are mutually falling into each other. <!--SR:!2025-03-22,172,345!2025-08-25,312,385-->
- [tidal acceleration](../../../../general/tidal%20acceleration.md) ::@:: Recall that tidal dissipation decelerates Earth's rotation. It also accelerates the Moon temporarily; afterwards, the Moon's orbital radius increases, so the Moon's average orbital velocity actually decreases instead. This can also be explained by conservation of angular momentum: the angular momentum of Earth is transferred to the Moon's orbit. <!--SR:!2026-04-08,503,405!2026-03-17,485,405-->
- [tidal locking](../../../../general/tidal%20locking.md) ::@:: Assume there are two co-orbiting (orbiting) bodies, _A_ and _B_. _A_ is tidally locked when the rotation rate of _A_ does not change over the course of a complete orbit. The definition is similar for _B_. Alternatively, it may _exclusively_ refer to 1:1 synchronous rotation, where the rotation periods equal the orbital periods, like the Moon right now. We will use the latter definition in this course. <!--SR:!2025-10-20,343,385!2026-06-03,550,405-->
  - [tidal locking](../../../../general/tidal%20locking.md) / [Moon](../../../../general/Moon.md) ::@:: Recall that the Moon's orbital period equals its rotation period. That means the Moon is tidally locked to Earth. It has done so within 100 million years. Earth has also slowed down its rotation period from about 6 hours to the current 24 hours over about 4.5 billion years. This is because Earth's mass is larger than the Moon, so it takes longer. Eventually, in about 50 billion years, the Earth's rotation period will slow down enough by tidal dissipation that it becomes tidally locked to the Moon as well. (Though the Sun would have become a red giant and engulf Earth and the Moon way before then.) <!--SR:!2025-07-16,264,365!2026-02-09,431,385-->

          - [stellar corona § coronal heating problem](../../../../general/stellar%20corona.md#coronal%20heating%20problem) / low corona density / examples / falling chain experiment ::@:: Compare a bead and a chain of bead connected to a table. Make the bead and the bead at the end of the chain start falling from the same height. One would find that the bead at the end of the chain falls faster than the lone bead. One way to see this is conservation of energy or conservation of momentum. A more thorough explanation is as follows: Consider the beads at the very bottom at every moment. When they stop falling down, a force pulls them up to decelerate them. The force comes from the part of the chain that has already fallen and also the part of the chain that has not yet fallen. By Newton's third law, the part of the chain that has not yet fallen gets pulled downward, apart from gravity. So the end bead accelerates faster than the lone bead, which is only affected by gravity. <!--SR:!2025-03-10,161,345!2025-06-14,236,365-->

Annie Jump Cannon is known for creating the Harvard Classification Scheme. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin later realized that the classification corresponds to the star's surface temperature. <!--SR:!2025-01-11,109,332!2025-06-20,241,352-->

  - measuring [stellar mass](../../../../general/stellar%20mass.md) / details ::@:: $T$ and $a$ can be obtained from two of the following three parameters: orbital period, orbital separation (semi-major axis), orbital velocity. Then we can determine $M + m$. Lastly, to determine $M$ and $m$ separately, note that a body orbiting another body is more accurately described as the two bodies around their barycenter, which is also their center of mass. When $M \approx m$, the barycenter will be in approximately the middle of their orbital separation. Anyway, the distances from the two bodies to the barycenter can give the ratio of $M$ and $m$, which can be used to find $M$ and $m$ separately from $M + m$. <!--SR:!2024-12-31,130,392!2026-03-14,476,392-->

Later, when the core is hot enough to become a radiative zone, the collapse is very slow but the surface temperature increases, so it follows the Henyey tracks and goes horizontally to the left (and slightly upwards) in the HR diagram. At the end of the Henyey track, nuclear fusion starts, and a temporary dip in luminosity occurs, until it reaches the main sequence.

The core contracts and heats up to increase the internal pressure to the same level again (by burning the hydrogen-rich shell around the core, which refills the core with hydrogen). The overall fusion rate increases due to higher temperature, causing the outer part of the star to expand. The surface becomes cooler because of lower energy density. So a main-sequence star gradually increase in radius and decrease in surface temperature, corresponding to moving up-right in the HR diagram. <!--SR:!2025-01-10,116,344!2025-01-21,141,405-->

Larger stars contract entirely instead of only the core, and the surface temperature increases, but the luminosity still increases. Hence, their positions in the HR diagram will additionally show a hook shape (up-left, then up-right).

Why? Great inward pressure without outward pressure matter to be stuck in lowest quantum states. This creates an outward degeneracy pressure. If there is any thermal pressure, then the thermal pressure counteracts some of the inward pressure, and the remaining inward pressure reduces. So there is less inward pressure forcing matter to be stuck in lowest quantum states, thus less outward degeneracy pressure. The total pressure (degeneracy + thermal) remains unchanged. When the thermal pressure exceeds the degeneracy pressure, at which point all inward pressure are counteracted by thermal pressure, so there is no remaining inward pressure forcing matter to be stuck in lowest quantum states, thus no degeneracy pressure. This also implies the matter is no longer degenerate. _Simply put, degeneracy pressure makes up for the deficit when thermal pressure is not enough to counteract the inward pressure._ <!--SR:!2026-03-04,465,405!2025-01-18,141,404-->

However, the pressure of degenerate matter does not increase with temperature, so the core does not expand to cool down. Therefore, helium fusion heats the core temperature in a positive feedback loop. A runaway helium fusion involving the entire core happens almost simultaneously, producing energy comparable to the entire Milky Way galaxy. This cannot be observed, however, as most of the energy goes to lifting the degeneracy, and leftover energy are absorbed by the star's upper layers. This is known as a _helium flash_.

The temperature of both thus decreases. The hydrogen and helium fusion rates both decreases as the core temperature drops. The star's outer layer shrinks due to decreased fusion rate in and near the core. The surface temperature increases as a result. However, the overall luminosity is still less than the red giant. Hydrostatic equilibrium is restored, similar to main sequence, but this time with a helium fusing core and a hydrogen fusing shell around it. The star has entered the _horizontal branch_. (Larger stars also enter the horizontal branch, but without a helium flash. Even larger stars enter the blue loop instead.) <!--SR:!2025-10-17,313,344!2025-02-07,136,345-->

In the HR diagram, the star moves down-left. Stars that expel more mass decrease more in size and increase more in surface temperature, so moves further down-left in the HR diagram. The stars in this phase looks like a horizontal branching out from the red giants in the HR diagram, hence its name. <!--SR:!2025-10-21,317,344!2025-05-18,213,365-->

They also grow (and shrink) in size after main sequence ends, though the resulting sizes are so large that we call them "sub-supergiants" (this name is actually not used because the duration is too short) and "red supergiants" instead. <!--SR:!2026-03-06,466,406!2024-12-21,110,386-->
  - [stellar evolution § massive stars](../../../../general/stellar%20evolution.md#massive%20stars) / differences with mid-size stars ::@:: Hydrogen fusion is primarily via CNO cycle instead of proton–proton chain. Another difference is instead of a helium flash, helium fusion ignites gradually, as the core fails to become degenerate before the core temperature is high enough for helium fusion. And lastly, fusion of carbon and heavier elements is possible and happens in multiple separate shells. Shells that burn heavier elements are inside shells that burn lighter elements. The fusion can continue up until iron. <!--SR:!2024-12-21,114,384!2025-01-16,122,345-->

  - [white dwarf § stars with very low mass](../../../../general/white%20dwarf.md#stars%20with%20very%20low%20mass) ::@:: The white dwarf consists of helium. Said stars never get hot enough to fuse helium. This is hypothetical, however, as their lifetimes are much longer than the lifetime of the universe. Currently observed helium white dwarfs are likely formed by another process instead. <!--SR:!2025-05-24,215,367!2025-02-12,140,347-->

  - [uncertainty principle](../../../../general/uncertainty%20principle.md) ::@:: Values of conjugate variables, such as position $x$ and momentum $p$, are both subject to uncertainties that are coupled according to: $$\Delta x \Delta p \ge \frac \hbar 2 = \frac h {4 \pi}$$. Note that classical mechanics is deterministic while quantum mechanics is probabilistic. <!--SR:!2025-10-06,305,347!2025-03-07,174,407-->
  - [degenerate matter](../../../../general/degenerate%20matter.md) & [uncertainty principle](../../../../general/uncertainty%20principle.md) ::@:: In degenerate matter, fermions are compressed into a smaller volume. That means the spread of position $\Delta x$ decreases. To respect the above relationship, the spread of momentum $\Delta p$ increases. Hence, there is a higher probability that the fermions move faster. This exerts _degeneracy pressure_ on the surrounding matter. <!--SR:!2025-01-20,138,407!2026-05-18,531,427-->

  - [Chandrasekhar limit](../../../../general/Chandrasekhar%20limit.md) ::@:: It was thought that a white dwarf can have any mass. Chandrasekhar showed in 1931 that electron degeneracy pressure can only support a white dwarf if its mass is less than 1.4 solar masses, taking relativity into account (limited by the speed of light). <!--SR:!2025-05-09,218,367!2025-01-20,128,387-->

- [Algol paradox](../../../../general/Algol%20paradox.md)
- [white dwarf § binary stars and novae](../../../../general/white%20dwarf.md#binary%20stars%20and%20novae) ::@:: A white dwarf in  a close binary system can gain mass from its main sequence or giant companion star. By the conservation of momentum, the matter falling on the white dwarf forms an _accretion disk_. The matter orbits faster and faster until it lands on the surface. The accretion disk also heat up due to friction between matter, emitting infrared, visible, and perhaps X-ray. <!--SR:!2025-06-08,228,367!2025-01-27,125,347-->
  - [nova](../../../../general/nova.md) ::@:: The accreted matter (mostly hydrogen) accumulating on the surface of a white dwarf in a close binary system may eventually become hot and dense enough to ignite sudden hydrogen fusion. The sudden energy production expels the accreted matter and causes a bright flash. It is not as bright as a supernova but is still 100&nbsp;000 times brighter than the Sun (hence its name). <!--SR:!2025-03-06,157,367!2025-05-30,220,367-->
    - [nova](../../../../general/nova.md) / recurrent ::@:: Some white dwarf can repeat the above process multiple times and have multiple novae. Sometimes the white dwarf may gain mass after each nova, until it approaches the Chandrasekhar limit and produce a Type Ia supernova instead (and no more novae are possible afterwards as the white dwarf is completely exploded apart). <!--SR:!2024-12-21,110,387!2025-01-12,122,387-->

  - [Type Ia supernova](../../../../general/Type%20Ia%20supernova.md) vs [nova](../../../../general/nova.md) ::@:: The former is much more luminous (~10 million times) than the latter. Another difference is that in the former, the entire white dwarf is completely exploded (energy from runaway carbon fusion exceeding the gravitational binding energy), leaving behind nothing but an expanding cloud of hot gas. No more novae are possible. In the latter, only the accreted matter is expelled. More novae are possible. <!--SR:!2025-05-20,230,387!2025-05-24,234,387-->
  - [Type Ia supernova](../../../../general/Type%20Ia%20supernova.md) vs [Type II supernova](../../../../general/Type%20II%20supernova.md) ::@:: Their light curves (decay of luminosity with time) differ. Both peaks and decreases quickly initially, and then decays slowly. A difference is that, in the former, the remaining energy comes from the radioactive decay of unstable heavy elements produced in the explosion. The latter may (Type II-P) have a plateau (temporarily decaying much slower) due to the expansion and cooling of the outer envelope (hydrogen in the outer envelope prevents photons from escaping temporarily due to being ionized). Most importantly, the former has no hydrogen spectra lines (hydrogen mostly consumed during novas) while the latter does have. <!--SR:!2025-02-05,134,347!2025-06-08,229,367-->
- [neutron star](../../../../general/neutron%20star.md) ::@:: A ball of neutrons (in the simplest models) left behind by a supernova of a massive star. The neutron degeneracy pressure supports it against gravitational collapse. <!--SR:!2026-02-05,422,407!2026-02-28,461,407-->
  - [neutron star](../../../../general/neutron%20star.md) / radius ::@:: A neutron star of 1.4 solar masses has 10 km radius, which is the size of Hong Kong Island!!! <!--SR:!2025-05-31,235,387!2025-06-20,244,387-->
  - [neutron star](../../../../general/neutron%20star.md) / brief history ::@:: Neutrons were discovered in 1932. Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky postulated the existence of neutron stars 2 years later in 1934, but it seemed to exist on paper and impossible to be detected. The idea did not receive much attention until 1967. <!--SR:!2025-02-24,147,347!2025-05-04,214,367-->
- [pulsar](../../../../general/pulsar.md) ::@:: a highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation (e.g. infrared, X-ray) out of its magnetic poles (not necessarily aligned with its rotational axis) <!--SR:!2025-07-31,287,387!2026-07-13,579,427-->
  - [pulsar](../../../../general/pulsar.md) / brief history ::@:: While making observations using a radio telescope in 1967, Jocelyn Bell noticed very regular pulses of radio emission coming from a single part of the sky. <!--SR:!2025-01-22,120,347!2025-10-13,317,367-->
  - [pulsar](../../../../general/pulsar.md) / examples ::@:: The pulsar in Crab Nebula (M1, produced by SN 1054) pulses ~30 times per second. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,150,347!2025-04-07,181,367-->
  - [pulsar](../../../../general/pulsar.md) / radiation sources ::@:: As of 2024, still not precisely known. There are 2 radiation sources (at least in the slides). One is the _non-thermal_ synchrotron radiation emitted by particles accelerated rapidly along the magnetic field of the neutron star. The other is the _thermal_ radiation emitted by particles colliding with the star surface at the magnetic poles, which can range from radio waves to X-rays. (Think of the extremely strong magnetic fields of a neutron star as an extremely powerful particle accelerator.) <!--SR:!2025-11-08,330,347!2026-01-10,396,387-->
  - [pulsar](../../../../general/pulsar.md) / lighthouse model ::@:: The radiation from a pulsar can be observed only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth, similar to the way a lighthouse can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer.  (This model does not imply a complete rotation of a pulsar produces 2 pulses though! If the "lighthouse" is tilted slightly but not too much, it is possible for a complete rotation to produce only 1 pulse.) <!--SR:!2025-01-18,136,407!2025-07-15,262,387-->
  - [pulsar](../../../../general/pulsar.md) / [angular momentum § conservation of angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md#conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum) ::@:: Pulsars spin extremely quickly (~20% speed of light) due to conservation of angular momentum. To preserve the angular momentum they had when they were large in radius, they must spin very quickly (considering their radii are in the order of 10 km only). <!--SR:!2024-12-20,102,387!2025-08-27,294,387-->
    - [pulsar](../../../../general/pulsar.md) / [angular momentum § conservation of angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md#conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum) / back-of-the-envelope calculation ::@:: Consider a neutron star that has a radius of 10 km and spins 1&nbsp;000 times per second (as of 2024, the maximum confirmed spinning rate is 716 Hz). The surface rotation velocity would be about 60&nbsp;000 km/s, or approximately 20% of the speed of light, which is also close to the escape velocity of the neutron star. So a pulsar must be a neutron star to withstand said spinning rate. (Ok, actually there are pulsar-like white dwarfs... But we have only found 2 or 3, as of 2024.) <!--SR:!2025-01-19,117,347!2025-01-24,132,387-->
- [neutron star § spin up](../../../../general/neutron%20star.md#spin%20up) ::@:: Similar to white dwarfs, neutron stars can also form an accretion disk. The accreting matter adds angular momentum to the neutron star, increasing its spin. <!--SR:!2025-10-31,340,387!2025-02-20,149,367-->
- [X-ray burster](../../../../general/X-ray%20burster.md) ::@:: The matter accreting onto a neutron star is typically rich in hydrogen and helium. Eventually, it is hot and dense enough that hydrogen fuses continuously into helium. Soon. a helium flash occurs, producing a burst of X-rays. <!--SR:!2025-05-07,219,387!2025-09-08,292,367-->
- [neutron star § structure](../../../../general/neutron%20star.md#structure) ::@:: A _possible_ internal structure is quark gluon plasma surrounded by neutron—proton Fermi liquid and electron Fermi gas, which is surrounded by an ion lattice soaked in superfluid neutrons, which is surrounded by ions and electrons, and lastly followed by a thin atmosphere of hydrogen, helium, carbon, etc. <!--SR:!2024-12-23,98,347!2025-05-10,205,367-->
- [Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit](../../../../general/Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff%20limit.md), neutron star limit ::@:: Similar to electron degeneracy pressure, neutron degeneracy pressure (and nuclear forces) also has a maximum limit. It (and nuclear forces) can no longer support a neutron star if its mass exceed about 3 solar masses. (As of 2024, the range is 2.2 to 2.9 solar masses.) <!--SR:!2025-01-02,113,387!2025-01-07,127,407-->
  - [Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit](../../../../general/Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff%20limit.md), neutron star limit / note ::@:: Actually, since degeneracy pressure comes from the rapid movement of fermions and neutrons are more massive (in mass) than electrons, neutron degeneracy pressure should be weaker than electron degeneracy pressure. Indeed, calculation would yield about 0.7 solar masses. Since neutron stars are so much denser than white dwarfs, nuclear repulsive forces become important. If we also consider said forces together with neutron degeneracy pressure, the limit becomes about 3 solar masses. <!--SR:!2025-09-14,297,367!2025-02-01,145,407-->

  - [black hole](../../../../general/black%20hole.md) / brief history ::@:: Issac Newton assumed light behaviors like ordinary matter in his _Opticks_, 1704. Later, John Michell (1784) and Pierre Laplace (1798) predicted that a mass of a body could be so large that light cannot leave its surface. The term "black hole" was first used by John A. Wheeler in 1967. <!--SR:!2024-12-16,93,347!2025-11-08,347,347-->
  - [escape velocity](../../../../general/escape%20velocity.md)
  - [Schwarzschild radius](../../../../general/Schwarzschild%20radius.md) ::@:: A boundary within events of any kind (light) cannot affect an outside observer. Light cannot escape inside it. It is given by: $$r_s = \frac {2GM} {c^2}$$. It can be derived from the escape velocity equation by setting the escape velocity to the speed of light. (This derivation is based on Newtonian mechanics, which is inaccurate in this situation, but the final answer is somehow correct.) <!--SR:!2024-12-28,119,407!2025-01-28,145,407-->
    - [Schwarzschild radius](../../../../general/Schwarzschild%20radius.md) / surprising implications ::@:: Consider a non-rotating uncharged spherical object, made of ordinary matter, with a radius same as its Schwarzschild radius. Assume there is no mass outside the Schwarzschild radius (this is an important but frequently unmentioned assumption of the Schwarzschild radius). Such an object is not yet a singularity (no infinite density), but will eventually become one given enough time, since the Schwarzschild radius is also the event horizon. So the first surprising thing is that an event horizon forms before its singularity forms. Next, consider the density of the above object and its proportionality with the Schwarzschild radius: $$r_s \propto M = \rho V = \frac 4 3 \rho r^3 \overset {r := r_s} \implies r_s \propto \rho r_s^3 \implies \rho \propto r_s^{-2}$$. The density of the above object is inversely proportional to the square of its Schwarzschild radius. So the second surprising thing is that even ordinary matter with low density can become a black hole eventually as long as there is sufficient mass close enough together. <!--SR:!2025-09-26,297,347!2025-07-26,272,387-->
  - [black hole](../../../../general/black%20hole.md) / types ::@:: There are 4 types of black holes. A black hole is either non-rotating or rotating. A black hole is also either uncharged or charged. An non-rotating uncharged black hole is the simplest. <!--SR:!2026-03-16,471,407!2026-07-23,587,427-->
  - [black hole § singularity](../../../../general/black%20dwarf.md#singularity) ::@:: For a non-rotating (uncharged or charged) black hole, there is a point in the center called the singularity, which contains all the black hole's mass, has zero volume, and thus infinite density. <!--SR:!2025-01-08,125,387!2026-05-16,529,427-->
  - [black hole § event horizon](../../../../general/black%20hole.md#event%20horizon) ::@:: For a non-rotating (uncharged or charged) black hole, the event horizon is the surface of a sphere centered at the singularity with radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole. An event that occurs inside the event horizon cannot be detected by anyone outside because even light cannot escape from it. <!--SR:!2025-01-05,127,407!2024-12-31,122,407-->
    - [black hole § event horizon](../../../../general/black%20hole.md#event%20horizon) / misconceptions ::@:: First, the event horizon is not a "physical" surface. Passing through an event horizon would not feel any different to moving through ordinary space. Second, an outside observer cannot see such something fall through the event horizon. Instead, the outside observer would find that thing falling increasingly slowly but never passing through the event horizon, becoming increasingly redshifted, until it can no longer be seen. <!--SR:!2024-12-27,118,407!2024-12-16,96,347-->
  - [black hole](../../../../general/black%20hole.md) / radius ::@:: The event horizon is only 9 km in radius for a black hole of 3 solar masses. <!--SR:!2025-01-14,122,387!2025-12-31,417,407-->
    - [neutron star](../../../../general/neutron%20star.md) / radius
  - [no-hair theorem](../../../../general/no-hair%20theorem.md) ::@:: All stationary black holes are _uniquely_ characterized by three _externally_ observable parameters: mass, electric charge, and angular momentum. (This is actually a hypothesis and has not yet been mathematically proven.) <!--SR:!2025-03-01,170,407!2024-12-19,111,407-->
  - [black hole](../../../../general/black%20hole.md) / visualizations ::@:: A common visualization is a gravity well. Objects deform a elastic sheet based on their mass, creating a well. For black holes, the gravity well is so deep that there is a hole in the sheet. <!--SR:!2025-01-27,144,407!2025-01-26,141,407-->

      - [spaghettification](../../../../general/spaghettification.md), noodle effect / equation ::@:: A simple (but not very accurate) equation: $$\Delta F = \frac {2 G M m \Delta x} {r^3}$$, where $\Delta F$ is the force difference between the nearest and farthest point, and $\Delta x$ is the length of a falling rod parallel to the direction of gravity. <!--SR:!2025-04-24,196,367!2025-01-15,123,387-->
        - [spaghettification](../../../../general/spaghettification.md), noodle effect / equation / derivation ::@:: $$\Delta F = \frac {GMm} {r^2} - \frac {GMm} {(r + \Delta x)^2} = \frac {GMm\left((r + \Delta x)^2 - r^2\right)} {r^2(r + \Delta x)^2} = \frac {GMm \Delta x (2 r + \Delta x)} {r^2(r + \Delta x)^2}$$. Assuming $\Delta x \ll r$ so that $r + \Delta x \approx r$: $$\frac {GMm \Delta x (2 r + \Delta x)} {r^2(r + \Delta x)^2} \approx \frac {2 GMm \Delta x r} {r^4} = \frac {2 GMm \Delta x} {r^3}$$. <!--SR:!2024-12-29,106,347!2025-04-17,189,367-->
      - [spaghettification](../../../../general/spaghettification.md), noodle effect / surprising fact ::@:: Find the tidal force at the Schwarzschild radius: $$\Delta F \approx \frac {2 GMm \Delta x} {r_s^3} = \frac {2 GMm \Delta x} {\left(\frac {2GM} {c^2} \right)^3} \propto M^{-2}$$. This means the tidal force at the Schwarzschild radius actually decreases as the Schwarzschild radius increases, which is in turn proportional to the mass. This implies that the larger the black hole, the gentler the tidal force is at the Schwarzschild radius. An astronaut or a spacecraft would probably torn apart before reaching the event horizon of a stellar mass black hole, but can survive well into the event horizon of a supermassive black hole. <!--SR:!2025-01-05,40,347!2025-04-03,177,367-->
      - [spaghettification](../../../../general/spaghettification.md), noodle effect / other effects ::@:: For stellar mass (but not supermassive) black holes, for which the tidal force is strong before the event horizon, the noodle effect would make the temperature of the falling object would become hot enough to emit X-ray before it crosses the event horizon. <!--SR:!2026-02-02,438,407!2025-04-17,191,367-->
- What if the Sun is substituted by a black hole of the same mass? ::@:: Nothing interesting would happen except that there is no more light. Everything would orbit around the Sun mostly the same as if it were not replaced. This is because of the shell theorem, where a _spherically symmetric_ object (like the Sun) affects external objects as if all of its mass were concentrated at a point at its center (like a black hole). <!--SR:!2025-02-01,138,387!2024-12-25,113,387-->

  - [gravitational time dilation](../../../../general/gravitational%20time%20dilation.md) / equation ::@:: $$t_0 = t_f \sqrt{1 - \frac {r_s} r }$$, where $t_0$ is the _proper time_ for an observer close to the mass, $t_f$ is the _coordinate time_ for an observer arbitrary large distance away, $r_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius of the mass, and $r$ is the distance of the observer close to the mass from the center of the mass. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,171,367!2025-11-29,361,387-->
- [gravitational redshift](../../../../general/gravitational%20redshift.md) ::@:: Light is red-shifted when moving out of a gravity well (and blue-shifted when moving in). This is a consequence of gravitational time dilation. (There are also other equivalent interpretations.) <!--SR:!2025-02-10,152,407!2026-02-13,427,407-->

  - [black hole](../../../../general/black%20hole.md) / detection / [X-ray binary](../../../../general/X-ray%20binary.md) ::@:: They are binary stars that are luminous in X-rays. By measuring the mass of the compact object (via measuring other properties), we can guess whether it is a black hole by seeing if the mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (~3 solar masses). <!--SR:!2025-01-11,114,347!2026-01-07,395,387-->

An _Einstein's cross_ may be seen when the massive object is elliptical. Complex massive objects produce complex lensing patterns. <!--SR:!2024-12-25,117,407!2025-02-01,149,407-->

  - [gravitational wave](../../../../general/gravitational%20wave.md) / detection ::@:: They are very weak, especially over long distances. So we can only directly detect those from binary neutron stars or binary black holes, and even then highly sensitive instrument such as Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) are needed. Indirect evidence includes decreasing orbital period of binary pulsar systems. <!--SR:!2025-01-24,132,387!2025-01-20,139,407-->

New telescopes in 1990s put this into question as they found many came from very distant galaxies. They are so luminous that, if we assume they emit light equally in all direction, their luminosities would exceed 1 million galaxies. This seems unlikely, and they are more likely to emit light collimated into a narrow jet. <!--SR:!2025-01-28,125,347!2026-01-14,403,407-->
  - [gamma-ray burst](../../../../general/gamma-ray%20burst.md) / explanations ::@:: They may come from supernova explosions, in which theoretically, gamma-rays may be released along the axis of rotation during the collapse of a rapidly rotating, high-mass star.

The cloud, called _protogalactic gas cloud_, however, was much larger. It also contained hydrogen and helium only, as it was very early in the universe's history. Fragmentation caused multiple star clusters to form in a random spheroidal distribution, which would later become the halo. This explains the random spheroidal orbit distribution of the halo. At the same time, the remaining gas settled into a spinning disk, and stars continuously form in the disk until now. This explains why the orbits are planar and in the same direction. (The process is similar to a protoplanetary disk.) Meanwhile, the halo has too little gas to form new stars. (This model is extremely oversimplified.) <!--SR:!2025-04-09,167,327!2025-08-12,285,387-->

  - [§ main sequence fitting](../../../../general/cosmic%20distance%20ladder.md#main%20sequence%20fitting), [spectroscopic parallax](../../../../general/spectroscopic%20parallax.md) ::@:: It may be applied to a main-sequence star or a star cluster containing many main sequence stars. In the former, we determine the spectral type of the star to know its approximate luminosity. Then compare it with its apparent brightness to find out its approximate distance. In a star cluster, we can obtain its main sequence strip in a HR diagram and compare it against with the strips of other star clusters with known distances. The latter is more accurate because more stars are used to estimate the distance. <!--SR:!2025-01-14,124,391!2024-12-25,107,391-->
    - [§ main sequence fitting](../../../../general/cosmic%20distance%20ladder.md#main%20sequence%20fitting) / limit ::@:: <~10 kpc, because the main-sequence stars are too dim to provide a spectrum to us <!--SR:!2025-04-29,179,371!2025-01-22,130,391-->
  - [Cepheid variable](../../../../general/Cepheid%20variable.md) ::@:: very luminous stars that varies in brightness periodically; brighter stars varies in brightness slower, like a blue whale's heart rate is lower than that of a mouse <!--SR:!2025-12-08,386,391!2025-01-10,120,391-->
    - [Cepheid variable](../../../../general/Cepheid%20variable.md) / limit ::@:: <~25 Mpc, because they are much more luminous than most main-sequence stars <!--SR:!2025-09-23,304,371!2025-01-13,123,391-->
    - [Cepheid variable](../../../../general/Cepheid%20variable.md) / examples ::@:: Delta Cephei, which has its apparent magnitude varies between 3.5 and 4.5 every 5.4 days <!--SR:!2024-12-16,105,391!2025-11-06,361,391-->
    - [Cepheid variable](../../../../general/Cepheid%20variable.md) / [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](../../../../general/Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md) ::@:: They occur in a region of the HR diagram called the instability strip, a straight line strip extending up-right from the middle of the main sequence strip. <!--SR:!2025-08-26,282,371!2025-09-26,306,371-->
    - [Cepheid variable](../../../../general/Cepheid%20variable.md) / [κ–mechanism](../../../../general/kappa–mechanism.md) ::@:: They pulsate because of periodic imbalance between thermal pressure and gravity. When the star contracts (and becomes dimmer), helium heats up by gravitational contraction. The helium is eventually hot enough to become doubly ionized, which is more opaque. It absorbs more light, which causes helium to heat up even more. Eventually, the thermal pressure expands the star (and becomes brighter). The helium cools down by gravitational contraction and becomes singly-ionized, which is more transparent. So the helium continues to cool down, causing the star to contract again. Then the cycle repeats. The stars become dimmest during the part of the cycle when the helium is doubly ionized. <!--SR:!2025-05-10,200,371!2024-12-26,108,391-->
    - [Cepheid variable](../../../../general/Cepheid%20variable.md) / reason Cepheid variable has a narrow temperature range ::@:: Hotter stars can never form a variable layer. Cooler stars have its variable layer located deeper, which cannot significantly vary the size and surface temperature of the star. <!--SR:!2024-12-18,107,391!2025-01-18,126,391-->
    - [Cepheid variable](../../../../general/Cepheid%20variable.md) / [RR Lyrae variable](../../../../general/RR%20Lyrae%20variable.md) ::@:: They are separate type of variable stars from Cepheid variables, which have short periods and lie on the instability strip where it crosses the horizontal branch. Its distribution is a horizontal rectangle, rather than a slope, on a (average) luminosity—period graph. <!--SR:!2024-12-20,109,391!2025-12-06,385,391-->
    - [Cepheid variable](../../../../general/Cepheid%20variable.md) / brief history ::@:: In 1912, Henrietta Leavitt, an astronomer at Harvard, discovered that the periods of these variable stars in a cluster was correlated with the brightness of the stars. <!--SR:!2025-07-20,271,371!2025-09-07,292,371-->
      - [Cepheid variable](../../../../general/Cepheid%20variable.md) / brief history / determination ::@:: This was determined by comparing thousands of photographic plates to get the period and the _relative_ brightness of each variable star. The absolute luminosity is determined by using Shapley's systematic study of globular clusters. _Spectrscopic parallax_ is used to determine cluster distances. Then the absolute luminosities are computed from the cluster distances and the relative brightnesses. <!--SR:!2025-01-02,119,391!2025-10-29,330,371-->
    - [Cepheid variable](../../../../general/Cepheid%20variable.md) / (average) luminosity & period (for classical Cepheid variables) ::@:: ($x$: $\log_{10} P - 1$, slope: -2.43, y-intercept: -4.05) $$M_{\mathrm {v} }=(-2.43\pm 0.12)\left(\log _{10}P-1\right)-(4.05\pm 0.02)$$, with _P_ measured in days. <!--SR:!2024-12-14,7,271!2025-01-14,129,391-->
      - [Cepheid variable](../../../../general/Cepheid%20variable.md) / (average) luminosity & period (for classical Cepheid variables) / graph ::@:: The resulting (average) luminosity—period log graph looks like a straight line from 3 days and 1000 solar luminosities to 100 days and 30&nbsp;000 solar luminosities. <!--SR:!2025-04-19,183,351!2025-01-17,45,351-->
  - [§ Type Ia light curves](../../../../general/cosmic%20distance%20ladder.md#Type%20Ia%20light%20curves) ::@:: As Type Ia supernovae are produced by white dwarfs of similar mass (~1.4 solar masses), their luminosities peaks at an absolute magnitude of about -19.3 or about 5 billion solar luminosities. <!--SR:!2025-02-02,51,371!2025-06-18,230,371-->

    - [Hubble's law](../../../../general/Hubble's%20law.md) / Edwin Hubble ::@:: Hubble received an undergraduate degree in math and astronomy, then a law degree from Oxford. After practicing law for a while, he decided to return to his first interest and pursued a PhD, graduating at age 30 in 1919 (after serving in WW1). <!--SR:!2025-03-26,160,351!2024-12-30,111,391-->
    - [Hubble's law](../../../../general/Hubble's%20law.md) / brief history ::@:: the Great Debate and "spiral nebulae": Is the Milky Way the entire universe or not? Some argued "spiral nebulae" were entire galaxies while others said they were smaller collections of stars within the Milky Way. Hubble settled the debate by measuring the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy __using Cepheid variables__ (tested in the [final examination](final%20examination.md)) as standard candles. (Shapley was on the wrong side of the Great Debate.) He also found that the spectral features of _virtually_ all galaxies are redshifted. More data at further distances were published on 1934-09. <!--SR:!2025-04-08,173,351!2025-08-03,268,371-->

    - [§ Hubble time](../../../../general/Hubble's%20law.md#Hubble%20time) ::@:: If we reverse time, then Hubble's law would eventually make all galaxies in the observable universe go back to a point. This hints at the beginning of the universe. The Hubble time is the time it takes for this to happen, assuming the Hubble constant is constant over time (which it is not; it is only constant over space). It is simply the reciprocal of the Hubble constant (after simplifying the units): $$t_H = \frac 1 {H_0}$$. <!--SR:!2025-02-12,148,417!2024-12-19,94,397-->
  - [expansion of the universe](../../../../general/expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md) ::@:: The universe appears to expand at the same rate everywhere in space. However, it is not expanding to "anything" (no center or edge, though the _observable_ universe does have an edge). An example of an expanding "thing" without a center of edge is the surface of an expanding balloon. <!--SR:!2025-02-02,131,397!2025-02-04,140,417-->
  - [cosmological principle](../../../../general/cosmological%20principle.md) ::@:: The universe should look the same on large enough scale anywhere. For example, matter should be distributed evenly on a large enough scale. This has not been proven formally but is consistent with observations so far. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,173,417!2026-05-09,512,417-->
  - [cosmic time § lookback time](../../../../general/cosmic%20time.md#lookback%20time)
    - [cosmic time § lookback time](../../../../general/cosmic%20time.md#lookback%20time) / uses ::@:: For extremely far objects, their distances to us would have changed drastically while their light travels to us. So it is more useful to use lookback time to indicate their locations for extremely far objects. <!--SR:!2026-01-05,403,397!2025-01-21,118,397-->
  - [Hubble's law](../../../../general/Hubble's%20law.md) / cosmological redshift ::@:: It is the stretching of photon wavelength by the expansion of the universe. An alternative way to view the Doppler redshift on a cosmological scale. Hubble hinted at this. (Okay, this is wrong... expanding space is only a choice of coordinates and thus cannot have physical consequences. So a Doppler redshift is really the only natural interpretation.) <!--SR:!2025-01-06,109,397!2025-10-09,308,377-->
    - [Doppler effect](../../../../general/Doppler%20effect.md)
  - [galaxy formation and evolution](../../../../general/galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md) ::@:: We can look at histories of galaxies by looking back into time. The farther you look back, the older you go. <!--SR:!2025-12-18,387,397!2025-01-16,114,397-->
    - [galaxy formation and evolution](../../../../general/galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md) / formation order ::@:: protogalaxies (young galaxies) → irregular galaxies → elliptical galaxies → spiral galaxies <!--SR:!2025-01-05,108,397!2025-01-03,106,397-->
    - [galaxy formation and evolution](../../../../general/galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md) / earliest galaxies ::@:: We cannot directly observe them and instead rely on theoretical models. The models assume hydrogen and helium initially fill the universe almost uniformly. The imperfections seed galaxy formation. <!--SR:!2025-02-10,146,417!2025-07-17,249,377-->
    - [§ commonly observed properties of galaxies](../../../../general/galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md#commonly%20observed%20properties%20of%20galaxies)
      - [galaxy formation and evolution](../../../../general/galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md) / forming spiral galaxies ::@:: Due to imperfections, gravity can form protogalatic clouds from the almost uniform hydrogen and helium. Very massive stars are formed and died quickly, before spiral disks can form. Supernovae heated the surrounding gas and slowed down the collapse. So new galaxies can attract more material before settling into spiral disks, such as NGC 4414. <!--SR:!2025-08-21,253,317!2025-07-17,247,377-->
      - [galaxy formation and evolution](../../../../general/galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md) / forming elliptical galaxies ::@:: It depends on initial conditions. Clouds that have large angular momentum or low density tend to form spiral galaxies. Clouds that have small angular momentum or high density tend to form elliptical galaxies, such as M87. <!--SR:!2025-09-24,323,397!2026-02-01,423,397-->
        - [Hubble sequence](../../../../general/Hubble%20sequence.md)

        - [galaxy formation and evolution](../../../../general/galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md) / factors / evidences ::@:: Distant red elliptical galaxies are observed. They are very old galaxies containing only red low-mass star without star formation activity. <!--SR:!2025-10-22,319,377!2026-03-09,453,397-->
      - [galaxy formation and evolution](../../../../general/galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md) / angular momentum ::@:: With the conservation of angular momentum in mind, initial angular momentum determines whether the cloud spins fast enough to form a spiral after collapsing. <!--SR:!2026-01-15,410,397!2025-01-01,105,397-->
      - [galaxy formation and evolution](../../../../general/galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md) / density ::@:: Initial density affects the star formation rate. High density clouds form stars faster and consumes much star-making material. The radiation pressure prevents said clouds from collapsing into spiral galaxies and becomes elliptical galaxies instead. Low density clouds form stars slower and allow sufficient time for gas to settle into spiral disks. <!--SR:!2026-01-04,402,397!2025-10-28,322,377-->
      - [galaxy formation and evolution § galaxy mergers and the formation of elliptical galaxies](../../../../general/galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md#galaxy%20mergers%20and%20the%20formation%20elliptical%20galaxies) (galaxy collision) ::@:: It is possible for galaxies to collide and form giant elliptical galaxies. The ratio of galaxy sizes over galaxy distances is much larger then the ratio of star sizes over star distances, so galaxies are much more likely than stars to collide (though stars could still collide). (Exercise: Compute the ratio of the solar radius over the distance to Alpha Centauri, the closest star. Then compute the ratio of the radius of the Milky Way galaxy over the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy. Compare the 2 ratios.) <!--SR:!2025-01-21,119,397!2025-03-11,167,417-->
        - [galaxy merger](../../../../general/galaxy%20merger.md)
    - [galaxy merger](../../../../general/galaxy%20merger.md) ::@:: Two galaxies collide. However, as mentioned above, stars are unlikely to collide in a collision due to the low ratio of star sizes over star distances. <!--SR:!2025-12-30,399,397!2024-12-22,101,397-->
      - [galaxy merger](../../../../general/galaxy%20merger.md) / Milky Way galaxy ::@:: In ~2.5 billion years, the Andromeda Galaxy will collide with our Milky Way galaxy. However, the Sun is unlikely to collide with other stars. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,192,417!2025-10-24,320,377-->
      - [galaxy merger](../../../../general/galaxy%20merger.md) / examples ::@:: tails and bridges: Antennae Galaxies, rings: Cartwheel Galaxy, mergers: NGC5128 <!--SR:!2025-02-22,111,277!2025-02-16,114,357-->
      - [interacting galaxy § galactic cannibalism](../../../../general/interacting%20galaxy.md#galactic%20cannibalism) ::@:: Large galaxies, due to their larger size and strong gravitational effect, tend to distort and consume galaxies. The Milky Way galaxy might be doing so on the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, distorting them into the irregular shapes we see now. <!--SR:!2025-02-20,149,417!2025-02-22,151,417-->
      - [galaxy merger](../../../../general/galaxy%20merger.md) / chances ::@:: They were more likely in the early universe because galaxies were much closer before much expansion took place. An evidence for this is that irregular galaxies at great distance (i.e. of old age) seem violently distributed. <!--SR:!2025-12-19,392,397!2025-12-17,388,397-->
      - [galaxy merger](../../../../general/galaxy%20merger.md) / results ::@:: It can trigger a sudden burst of star formation, called _starburst_, due to compressions of clouds. This consumes much of the interstellar medium, and the many new stars and subsequent supernovae blow away the remaining gases. Finally, there is little gas left to form a disk and to form stars, so the merged galaxy becomes an elliptical galaxy. (Computer models show that two colliding spiral galaxies can produce an elliptical galaxy.) This may explain why elliptical galaxies are found where galaxies are clustered together, and giant elliptical galaxies in the cluster centers seem to have consumed a number of smaller galaxies. <!--SR:!2024-12-14,91,377!2025-02-15,138,397-->
  - self-reading, not tested
    - [starburst galaxy](../../../../general/starburst%20galaxy.md) ::@:: Galaxies that are currently forming stars rapidly. The gas are used up in less than a billion years. The many supernovae can drive _galactic winds_. An example is M82. <!--SR:!2025-08-23,274,377!2024-12-31,105,397-->
    - [active galactic nucleus](../../../../general/active%20galactic%20nucleus.md) (AGN) ::@:: Centers of galaxies that are unusually luminous. <!--SR:!2025-08-07,279,377!2025-03-25,180,417-->
      - [quasar](../../../../general/quasar.md) ::@:: Also called _quasi-stellar objects_. The most luminous subtype of active galactic nuclei. They can be discovered by comparing objects in visible light and positions of strong radio sources. They are found at great distance, thus a long time ago (billions of years), when galaxies were very young. No quasars and few active galactic nuclei are found nearby. So quasar are probably one of the stages in galaxy evolution. <!--SR:!2024-12-31,104,397!2025-01-13,111,397-->
        - [quasar](../../../../general/quasar.md) / examples ::@:: 3C273: It looks like a bright blue star, but its hydrogen emission lines are strongly redshifted, indicating it is very distant. It has a luminosity exceeding 100 Milky Way galaxies. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,138,297!2025-06-17,199,377-->

        - [quasar](../../../../general/quasar.md) / sizes ::@:: Quasars can vary in brightness on the timescale of weeks, days, or even hours. In order for this to happen, quasar sizes must be smaller than the distance light travels in the time that the brightness changes. This indicates quasars can be smaller than one light-hour, which is about the size of our solar system. <!--SR:!2025-01-03,107,397!2025-05-10,191,357-->
        - [quasar](../../../../general/quasar.md) vs normal galaxies ::@:: For the latter, luminosities can range from 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;L<sub>⊙</sub> (the Milky Way galaxy: 2×10<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;L<sub>⊙</sub>). They emit a spectrum of thremal radiation. For the former, luminosities can exceed 10<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;L<sub>⊙</sub>, with strong radiation from radio waves to X-rays and beyond. <!--SR:!2025-01-25,123,397!2025-05-19,197,377-->
      - [radio galaxy](../../../../general/radio%20galaxy.md) ::@:: They are galaxies containing active nuclei shooting out jets of plasma matter close to the speed of light. Huge lobes of radio emission, which can extend up to hundreds of millions of light-years, are produced when the jets are decelerated by interaction with the intergalactic medium. <!--SR:!2025-10-06,307,377!2025-10-30,324,377-->

      - [§ unification of AGN species](../../../../general/active%20galactic%20nucleus.md#unification%20of%20AGN%20species) ::@:: There are models of AGN that propose different subtypes of AGN is a single type of AGN observed from different angles. If you look at a jet directly, it looks like a quasar. If you look at a jet almost directly, you can see an AGN with a single jet. If you look at it sideways, it looks like a radio galaxy, with double jets and lobes. However, said models are debated. <!--SR:!2025-01-18,115,397!2025-12-13,368,397-->
      - [active galactic nucleus](../../../../general/active%20galactic%20nucleus.md) / sources ::@:: The accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole seems to be the only way to explain all properties of AGN. Gravitational potential energy gets converted into kinetic energy by gravity, and then thermal energy by friction, and then photons by thermal radiation. 10—40% of energy can become radiation by this process. <!--SR:!2026-02-27,444,397!2025-01-20,118,397-->
      - [astrophysical jet](../../../../general/astrophysical%20jet.md) ::@:: Jets are thought to be charged particles emitted along the axis of the twisted magnetic field lines in the inner part of the accretion. It emits _thermal_ radiation. It also emits _non-thermal_ radiation called _synchrotron radiation_, caused by charged particles being accelerated rapidly. <!--SR:!2025-08-24,275,377!2025-06-17,229,377-->
    - [supermassive black hole](../../../../general/supermassive%20black%20hole.md) ::@:: They exists! Many galaxies, maybe even all of them, have supermassive black holes at their centers. Said supermassive black holes were probably all active galactic nuclei, and then became dormant (inactive) active galactic nuclei some time later. Also, their masses are closely related to the bulge of their belonging galaxies (with exceptions, of course). So we think the development of a central supermassive black hole is somehow related to galaxy evolution. <!--SR:!2025-03-26,181,417!2025-12-02,373,397-->

  - course parts
  - [cosmology](../../../../general/cosmology.md)
    - [cosmology](../../../../general/cosmology.md) / questions to ask ::@:: How much matter? How matter comes? Why expand? Is the expansion constant, accelerating, or decelerating? What is the shape (topology) of the universe (flat, curved, etc.)? What is the ultimate fate of the universe? (very abstract stuff ahead) <!--SR:!2026-03-12,454,397!2025-02-10,137,397-->
    - [universe](../../../../general/universe.md) / parameters (2020) ::@:: H<sub>0</sub> ≈ 67 km/s/Mpc, age: ~13.8 billion years, expansion: accelerate forever, geometry: flat <!--SR:!2024-12-30,102,397!2025-01-13,111,397-->
    - [universe § composition](../../../../general/universe.md#composition) (2020) ::@:: dark energy: 68.3%, dark matter: 26.8%, ordinary matter: 4.9% <!--SR:!2025-07-03,212,337!2025-08-22,277,377-->
      - [universe § composition](../../../../general/universe.md#composition) / ordinary matter ::@:: Hubble Edwin already gave an estimate in 1934. By counting luminous bodies and estimating the total mass, we get an average density of 10<sup>-30</sup> (more accurately, 4.5×10<sup>-31</sup>) g/cm<sup>3</sup>. But the observed gravitational effect indicate that there should be 10 times more mass than the above estimate. <!--SR:!2025-05-26,205,357!2025-10-29,323,377-->
      - [dark matter](../../../../general/dark%20matter.md) ::@:: Hypothetical matter that does not interact with light or the electromagnetic field, inferred from its gravitational effects (excess gravitational effect not explained by ordinary matter). <!--SR:!2025-03-15,172,417!2026-01-07,403,397-->
        - [dark matter](../../../../general/dark%20matter.md) / evidences ::@:: gravitational lensing in clusters of galaxies, orbital motion of stars and hydrogen in galaxies <!--SR:!2026-01-08,404,397!2025-03-05,162,417-->
          - [Milky Way](../../../../general/Milky%20Way.md) / a great mystery
          - measuring galactic mass ::@:: hydrogen orbital motion in _spirals_, spectral line broadening in _ellipticals_ <!--SR:!2025-06-25,233,377!2024-12-18,99,397-->
            - measuring galactic mass / [hydrogen line](../../../../general/hydrogen%20line.md) ::@:: As 21-cm radiation is produced by hydrogen, measuring its Doppler red- and blueshift can yield the radial velocity of hydrogen. If applied to opposite sides of _spiral_ galaxies, we can estimate its orbital velocity. In turns out the rotation curves (after the initial rapid increase) for spiral galaxies are flat instead of decreasing, implying the existence of dark matter. <!--SR:!2025-04-11,193,417!2025-01-08,106,397-->
              - [hydrogen line](../../../../general/hydrogen%20line.md)
            - measuring galactic mass / spectral line broadening ::@:: More massive _elliptical_ galaxies have stars moving faster due to higher gravity. So their velocity spreads, and hence Doppler shift spreads, are greater. Finally, their spectral lines are more broad, as the spectral lines of galaxies are a mix of spectral lines of each individual star in the galaxies. <!--SR:!2025-09-21,297,377!2024-12-24,97,377-->
          - measuring galaxy cluster mass ::@:: Doppler shift, gravitational equilibrium, gravitational lensing; all methods imply similar amounts of missing matter, called dark matter <!--SR:!2024-12-14,89,377!2025-02-24,153,417-->
            - measuring galaxy cluster mass / Doppler shift ::@:: Galaxies orbit each other in a cluster similar to stars orbit each other in a galaxy. So the Doppler shift can be applied to find their motions and orbital velocities. Then the mass can be found. <!--SR:!2025-08-02,262,377!2024-12-30,102,397-->
            - measuring galaxy cluster mass / gravitational equilibrium ::@:: Galaxy clusters contain large amount of hot (10<sup>6</sup>—10<sup>7</sup> K) X-ray-emitting gases, called the _intracluster medium_, which several times the mass of stars in clusters. The mass of the cluster can be then determined from gravitational equilibrium — the balance between gravitational attraction and "thermal gas pressure". <!--SR:!2025-03-04,138,357!2025-05-26,205,357-->
              - measuring galaxy cluster mass / gravitational equilibrium / results ::@:: dark matter: 85%, hot gas: 13%, stars: 2% <!--SR:!2025-08-21,289,377!2025-06-14,219,357-->
            - measuring galaxy cluster mass / gravitational lensing ::@:: The position of multiple images can provide cluster mass or even dark matter distribution. <!--SR:!2025-12-21,391,397!2025-06-28,235,377-->
              - [gravitational lens](../../../../general/gravitational%20lens.md)
        - [dark matter](../../../../general/dark%20matter.md) / alternatives ::@:: It exists. Or, gravity (general relativity) is wrong. Or, there are some unknown mechanism acting like gravity. Most astronomers prefer the first explanation because gravity is so well-tested, but we cannot be _absolutely_ sure. <!--SR:!2025-03-12,169,417!2025-04-12,194,417-->
        - [dark matter](../../../../general/dark%20matter.md) / nature ::@:: currently proposed: dark ordinary matter, exotic (extraordinary) matter, or both <!--SR:!2025-03-31,182,417!2025-01-15,113,397-->
          - [dark matter](../../../../general/dark%20matter.md) / nature / dark ordinary matter ::@:: massive compact halo object (MACHOS), like black holes, brown dwarfs, dead or failed stars, neutron stars, etc.; but currently not enough are found, even in the neighborhood of the Solar System <!--SR:!2025-10-14,313,377!2026-01-22,421,397-->
          - [dark matter](../../../../general/dark%20matter.md) / nature / exotic matter ::@:: axions (low-mass quasiparticles), mysterious neutrino-like particles (can only supply a small fraction of dark matter), primordial black holes, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS) <!--SR:!2024-12-20,93,377!2025-04-12,171,357-->
    - [static universe](../../../../general/static%20universe.md) ::@:: A universe that is unchanging, not even expanding. This is now known to be wrong. However, many people in older times thought the universe is static, including Albert Einstein. He even added a _cosmological constant_ to his field equations of relativity to make the universe static. The constant was removed when Hubble discovered the universe is expanding. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,423,397!2025-12-18,388,397-->
      - [Olbers's paradox](../../../../general/Olbers's%20paradox.md) ::@:: If the universe is homogeneous (everywhere the same), infinite, and static, then we would see stars in every direction and the night sky should be bright with stars covering all directions. This is obviously not the case. Mathematically, consider a unit of solid angle. The observed brightness is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. But the amount of star is proportional to the square of the distance. So these two proportionalities cancel out. No matter the distance, the observed brightness is the same for a unit of solid angle. <!--SR:!2024-12-18,93,397!2025-02-11,147,417-->
        - [Olbers's paradox](../../../../general/Olbers's%20paradox.md) / brief history ::@:: Kepler stated the problem in 1610, and the paradox took its mature form in the early 1800s. But it was named after Heinrich Olbers. <!--SR:!2025-08-27,280,377!2025-11-25,353,397-->
        - [Olbers's paradox](../../../../general/Olbers's%20paradox.md) / possible solutions ::@:: The universe has a finite number of stars surrounded by an infinite empty space (not homogeneous and infinite). Or, the universe is changing (not static; also the currently accepted solution). Non-solution: The universe is the surface of a 4-dimensional ball (not infinite). But paths of light can be circular in this case, so the sky is still infinitely bright. <!--SR:!2025-04-23,181,357!2024-12-29,108,397-->
    - [Big Bang](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md) ::@:: About 13.8 billion years ago, the hot and dense universe starts to expand from a very small size. This is the __Big Bang__. Before the age of about 1 second, the universe consists of energy (photons) at incredibly high temperature and pressure. At the age of 1 second, the universe is ~10<sup>10</sup> K and continues to cool as it expands. (But there are a lot of very weird physics happening in that 1 second, which we are skipping...) First stars were formed ~300 million years later. <!--SR:!2025-04-08,168,357!2025-07-25,256,377-->
      - [Big Bang](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md) / later ::@:: When the universe was still very hot, it was like a soup, mainly made of electrons, neutrinos, neutrons, and protons. Primordial nucleosynthesis created hydrogen (75%) and helium (25%) (and trace amounts of lithium and beryllium) nuclei when it got cooler, but before it cooled down to ~10<sup>9</sup> K. As it got even cooler, the conditions became favorable for the condensation of nebulae, galaxy formation, and star formation. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,339,377!2025-06-12,217,357-->
      - [Big Bang](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md) / misconceptions ::@:: The term "Big Bang" was used to make fun of the concept. The Big Bang was not an _explosion_ but _expansion_ of space. It does not imply a beginning in time, or the existence of a center of the universe, <!--SR:!2025-02-05,142,417!2025-02-02,130,397-->
      - [Big Bang](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md) / mathematics ::@:: An important parameter of the model is the expansion rate, which is derived from observed redshifts. Its exact value is very important. <!--SR:!2025-03-31,182,417!2025-01-12,118,397-->
      - Hubble's law implications
      - [Big Bang § observational evidence](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md#observational%20evidence) ::@:: 3 "pillars" (now 4): Hubble's law, cosmic background radiation, abundance of primordial elements; these make the Big Bang a basic framework of modern cosmology <!--SR:!2026-01-11,407,397!2025-01-08,106,397-->
        - [Big Bang § Hubble's law and the expansion of the universe](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md#Hubble's%20law%20and%20the%20expansion%20of%20the%20universe) ::@:: The observed red shift is not due to the _peculiar motion_ (local motion from gravitational interaction) of the galaxies, but is due to their recessions, caused by the expansion of spacetime itself. This is called _cosmological redshift_. But locally, peculiar motion of  individual galaxy still exists. <!--SR:!2025-02-07,134,397!2025-08-29,280,377-->

Alternative ways to explain the cosmological redshift were sought. There are also other predicted consequences of the Big Bang model that most ignored, such as the chemical composition of the early universe and the current temperature of the universe (no one tested this latter prediction experimentally until 1965). <!--SR:!2025-03-26,160,357!2024-12-19,93,377-->
        - [Big Bang § cosmic microwave background radiation](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md#cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation) ::@:: It is the background radiation from the Big Bang has been freely streaming across the universe since the universe became transparent to light when atoms formed at the temperature ~3000 K. After ~13.8 billion years, it has redshifted to a corresponding temperature of 2.725 K, which can also be described as the current temperature of the universe. <!--SR:!2025-12-28,399,397!2026-01-08,410,397-->
          - [Big Bang § cosmic microwave background radiation](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md#cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation) / brief history ::@:: The cosmic microwave background was discovered serendipitously (by accident). In 1965, Penzias and Wilson, two scientist working at Bell Telephone Laboratories, were working on microwave transmission. But they could not get rid of the omnidirectional and omnitemporal "background noise". It turned out to be _cosmic background radiation_ (CBR) (they hard the data but not theory). At nearby Princeton University, a team of scientists were setting up an experiment to look for CBR (they had the theory but not data). Two notes were published in _Astrophysics Journal Letters_ separately by the above 2 teams, each referencing each other. Wilson and Penzias received the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for this. <!--SR:!2025-03-26,160,357!2025-04-03,165,357-->
          - [Big Bang § cosmic microwave background radiation](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md#cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation) / Nobel Prize ::@:: 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics, to [Arno Allan Penzias](../../../../general/Arno%20Allan%20Penzias.md), [Robert Woodrow Wilson](../../../../general/Robert%20Woodrow%20Wilson.md), "for their discovery of [cosmic microwave background radiation](../../../../general/cosmic%20microwave%20background.md)". <!--SR:!2025-04-27,183,357!2025-10-25,321,377-->
          - [Big Bang § cosmic microwave background radiation](../../../../general/Big%20Bang.md#cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation) / details ::@:: When the early universe was hot, it was radiation-dominated. Matters were ions and electrons, which strongly scatter photons. The universe was opaque. When the universe cooled down enough (~3000 K), ions and electrons _recombine_ to form neutral atoms, which scatter photons much weakly. So the universe became transparent. The first photons to travel freely without being scattered and finally reaching Earth forms the cosmic microwave background, which is an almost perfect black body (follows the thermal radiation curve almost perfectly). The Big Bang predicts that the universe has expanded ~1000 times since the above recombination happened, so the radiation should be ~3 K now. This approximately matches the current value, 2.725 K. <!--SR:!2025-05-26,205,357!2025-12-10,382,397-->

But this cannot explain the relative abundance of H-1, H-2, and He-4, which comprises over 98% of normal matter _by mass_. The current hydrogen to helium ratio _by mass_ is about 3 to 1. But also, by the Big Bang model, shouldn't the temperature be high enough for _all_ (not just _some_, as observed) newly created hydrogen to fuse into helium in the very early universe? <!--SR:!2025-03-29,162,357!2025-04-19,157,357-->

Above ~10<sup>11</sup> K, the number of protons equaled that of neutrons. Below this, the former started to exceed the latter as protons are lighter than neutrons.

When all neutrons were consumed, nucleosynthesis ended. The ratio of hydrogen to helium _by mass_ is 3:1, which agrees with our current observations. Other element isotopes are predicted to have a ratio over hydrogen of 10<sup>-1</sup>:1 to 10<sup>-10</sup>:1, which mostly agrees with our current observations. <!--SR:!2025-11-05,330,377!2025-08-31,283,377-->

    - [cosmology](../../../../general/cosmology.md) / origin of cosmic structures ::@:: If the universe is _perfectly_ uniform initially, then gravity should not form any structures, as all forces are perfectly balanced. Indeed, the universe is only _almost perfectly_ uniform initially. The temperature of the cosmic background radiation (CBR) has small inhomogeneities with variations of 1 part in 100&nbsp;000. The inhomogeneities represent the inhomogeneities of the universe when recombination happens. <!--SR:!2025-12-09,381,397!2025-01-12,109,397-->

    - [cosmology](../../../../general/cosmology.md) / curvature of the universe ::@:: The angular size of variations in the cosmic background radiation (CBR) is determined by the curvature of the universe. If the universe is flat, the angular size is expected to be 1°, which agrees with current observations. <!--SR:!2025-01-16,114,397!2024-12-30,103,397-->

    - [cosmic inflation](../../../../general/cosmic%20inflation.md) ::@:: According to _inflation theory_, the universe began to suddenly inflate at the age of 10<sup>-38</sup> s (revised: 10<sup>-36</sup> s) by a factor of 10<sup>30</sup> within 10<sup>-36</sup> s (revised: 10<sup>-33</sup> to 10<sup>-32</sup> s). <!--SR:!2025-02-18,88,337!2025-02-26,141,357-->
      - [cosmic inflation](../../../../general/cosmic%20inflation.md) / causes ::@:: A _possible_ (unconfirmed, many other competing theories) cause is the massive amount of energy released by the separation of the strong force from the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) force. <!--SR:!2025-01-29,135,417!2026-04-18,494,417-->
      - [cosmic inflation](../../../../general/cosmic%20inflation.md) / explains... ::@:: It explains why the cosmic background radiation (CBR) is _almost perfect_. (A sentence in the slide that feels wrong: The small size of the universe allowed the temperature to almost equalize everywhere in the universe.) Inflation also explains why the universe looks flat, similar to the spherical Earth looking flat to us, as Earth is huge compared to us (the slide used an analogy based on an ant on a balloon being blown up). <!--SR:!2025-01-07,110,397!2025-12-27,392,397-->
    - [Planck units § Planck time](../../../../general/Planck%20units.md#Planck%20time) ::@:: $$\sqrt{\frac {\hbar G} {c^5} } \approx 5.39 \times 10^{-44}~\mathrm{s}$$, in which, within this time, quantum gravity governed and our current knowledge of physics breaks down! <!--SR:!2025-01-04,35,317!2024-12-15,58,317-->
    - [ultimate fate of the universe](../../../../general/ultimate%20fate%20of%20the%20universe.md) ::@:: Notice that the expansion of the universe competes with gravity. Will the universe continue to expand or collapse in the future? Is the rate of expansion constant, increasing, or decreasing? How is Hubble's constant changing over time? <!--SR:!2025-01-03,106,397!2025-12-25,394,397-->

      - [ultimate fate of the universe](../../../../general/ultimate%20fate%20of%20the%20universe.md) / models of expansion ::@:: There are 4 simple ones (suitable for a common core course, there are many others not mentioned here): recollapsing, critical, coasting, accelerating; characterized by the strength of gravity and a repulsive force <!--SR:!2025-03-26,160,357!2025-04-06,188,417-->

        - [ultimate fate of the universe](../../../../general/ultimate%20fate%20of%20the%20universe.md) / critical ::@:: moderate gravity, no repulsive force, expand forever while always decelerating (for example, imagine the expansion rate is described by a $v = 1 / t$ graph as $t$ approaches infinity) <!--SR:!2026-04-23,499,417!2025-06-29,235,377-->
        - [ultimate fate of the universe](../../../../general/ultimate%20fate%20of%20the%20universe.md) / coasting ::@:: weak gravity, no repulsive force, expand forever at the same rate (linear, so the Hubble time equals the age of the universe) <!--SR:!2026-04-22,498,417!2025-10-21,318,377-->
        - [ultimate fate of the universe](../../../../general/ultimate%20fate%20of%20the%20universe.md) / accelerating ::@:: has gravity, stronger-than-gravity repulsive force, expand forever while always accelerating <!--SR:!2025-02-22,156,417!2025-10-05,306,377-->
      - [ultimate fate of the universe](../../../../general/ultimate%20fate%20of%20the%20universe.md) / models of expansion / determination ::@:: We can try to determine to appropriate model of expansion by observing the expansion rates of distant galaxies. This is analogous to throwing a ball on Earth and watching it fall. The rising or falling of the ball corresponds to the universe expanding or collapsing. The initial velocity of the ball corresponds to the initial expansion rate. Gravity acting on the ball corresponds to gravity acting on the universe to collapse it. (But the repulsive force has no good analogy in this context.) <!--SR:!2025-12-15,383,397!2025-02-03,139,417-->
      - [ultimate fate of the universe](../../../../general/ultimate%20fate%20of%20the%20universe.md) / models of expansion / mathematics ::@:: One key parameter is the _normalized matter density_ $$\Omega_M = \frac \rho {\rho_c}$$, where $\rho$ is the matter density and $\rho_c$ is the _critical_ matter density. Then the past and future expansion rate of the universe depends on it. When $\Omega_M = 0$, the expansion model is coasting. When $\Omega_M = 1$, the expansion model is critical. When $\Omega_M > 1$, the expansion model is recollapsing. Interpolate for in between values. The resulting graph of expansion extent over time for all cases above looks somewhat similar to projectile motion. <!--SR:!2025-01-04,108,397!2025-08-16,268,377-->
        - [ultimate fate of the universe](../../../../general/ultimate%20fate%20of%20the%20universe.md) / models of expansion / mathematics / critical matter density ::@:: According to the Friedmann equations, the critical matter density is $$\rho_c = \frac {3 H^3} {8 \pi G} \approx 10^{-29}~\mathrm{g/cm^3}$$. <!--SR:!2024-12-20,40,257!2024-12-19,19,297-->
      - [ultimate fate of the universe](../../../../general/ultimate%20fate%20of%20the%20universe.md) / observations ::@:: It turns out the expansion of the universe is expanding. Initially, the universe inflated, and then expanded with a decreasing rate. Only after some billions of years did the universe start expanding with an increasing rate. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,368,397!2025-01-05,113,397-->

They discovered the accelerating expansion of the universe. It was named by _Science Magazine_ as the "Science Breakthrough of the Year" in 1998. They even got a Nobel Prize in 2011. <!--SR:!2025-01-16,113,397!2025-05-15,198,357-->
          - [ultimate fate of the universe](../../../../general/ultimate%20fate%20of%20the%20universe.md) / observations / brief history / quote: Brian Schmidt: "When we started in 1994 we were trying to literally weigh the universe by seeing how gravity would tug on the universe as it expands... We were expecting to measure how fast the universe was slowing down to weigh it. When we found that it was speeding up it was a big surprise..."
        - [ultimate fate of the universe](../../../../general/ultimate%20fate%20of%20the%20universe.md) / observations / Nobel Prize ::@:: 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, to [Saul Perlmutter](../../../../general/Saul%20Perlmutter.md), [Brian Schmidt](../../../../general/Brian%20Schmidt.md), [Adam Riess](../../../../general/Adam%20Riess.md), "for the discovery of the [accelerating expansion of the Universe](../../../../general/accelerating%20expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md) through observations of distant [supernovae](../../../../general/supernova.md)". <!--SR:!2025-05-15,198,357!2025-01-20,118,397-->

      - [dark energy](../../../../general/dark%20energy.md) ::@:: It turns out critical matter density is insufficient to explain our accelerating expansion of the universe. A repulsive force of unknown origin needs to be added, which we called __dark energy__. <!--SR:!2025-12-17,388,397!2025-03-05,162,417-->
        - [dark energy](../../../../general/dark%20energy.md) / details ::@:: As of 2024, like dark matter, we also have no idea what nature does dark energy have. But unlike dark matter, which we know must interact with gravity, we do not even know what dark energy interacts with. All we know is that it causes to universe to accelerate. (This is reminiscent of the _cosmological constant_ added and later removed by Einstein...) <!--SR:!2025-01-28,125,397!2024-12-30,107,397-->

        - [dark energy § evidence of existence](../../../../general/dark%20energy.md#evidence%20of%20existence) ::@:: We only have _indirect_ evidences. Apart from supernovae outlined above, the curvature of the universe (inferred from the cosmic background radiation (CBR)) is another indirect evidence. <!--SR:!2025-01-25,130,397!2025-02-15,149,417-->

          - [dark energy § cosmic microwave background](../../../../general/dark%20energy.md#cosmic%20microwave%20background) ::@:: As mentioned above, the cosmic background radiation (CBR) seem to indicate the universe is flat, so the matter density of the universe should equal the critical density. But the estimated the matter density is only one-fourth (1/4) the required. This can be solved by making the remaining three-fourths (3/4) dark energy. As energy is also mass by Einstein's mass–energy equivalence ($E = mc^2$), dark energy also exerts gravity. However, unlike ordinary and dark matter, it can also act like a repulsive force that accelerates the expansion of the universe. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,336,377!2025-01-18,116,397-->
        - [dark energy](../../../../general/dark%20energy.md) / debates ::@:: As of 2024, there are debates over its existence. For example, see debates in 2019, where a scientist at Oxford claims the Nobel-Prize-winning conclusion is wrong. (It is reminiscent of the great debate on "spiral nebulae", isn't it?) <!--SR:!2024-12-14,91,377!2025-01-06,114,397-->
