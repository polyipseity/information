# strip sequence test

- time limit: 20 minutes
- coverage: chapter 1—chapter 19
- contents: 3.8/4 marks
  - [questions](#questions)
    - question 1: 0.8/1 mark, 4 → 2 → 3 → 1 → 5
    - question 2: 1/1 mark
    - question 3: 1/1 mark
    - question 4: 1/1 mark

## marking scheme

Marking is done as follows. Full marks if 4 marks. Each strip sequence test carries 1 mark.

As each question has 5 choices, each question has are 5C2 = 10 pairs of choices. For each question, full marks is assumed originally. Each wrong pair deducts 0.2 marks. That is, if the ordering, when only considering the 2 choices in a pair, is correct, then no marks are deducted. Otherwise, there 0.2 marks is deducted. That means 5 or more wrong pairs result in 0 marks. This makes random guessing yields 0 marks on average.

> Q4. (exam, memory) Assume that now, after billions of years, Earth and the Moon has become mutually tidal locked. Under this situation, order the following points by increasing speed.
>
> Hint: speed of circular motion = 2 \* pi \* radius / period
>
> 1. a point on Earth's equator
> 2. north pole of Earth
> 3. Hong Kong (latitude 22°N)
> 4. a point on the Moon's equator
> 5. orbital motion of the Moon
>
> - solution: {@{2 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 5}@}
> - explanation: {@{Notice that in the hypothetical situation stated in the question, the angular velocity of all circular motions above are equal. So the linear velocity is directly proportional to the radius of the circular motion, i.e. $v \propto r$. This converts the above question into comparing the radii of above circular motions. For choice 3, its radius is given by multiplying Earth's (equatorial) radius by $\cos 22\degree$.}@} <!--SR:!2025-06-18,182,270!2026-12-13,567,310-->
