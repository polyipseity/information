# student-generated question

- HKUST PHYS 1002

## format

Each student should generate <u>ONE Multiple Choice (MC) question with FIVE choices (1 correct choice + 4 wrong choices)</u> based on the contents of the lecture notes.

## deadline

Deadline of submission of Students Generated Question (SGQ): 11:59 pm on 9 Aug 2024.

## late submission

Marks will be deducted for late submission of the SGQ according to the following formula:

For submissions that are late for _N_ days

Score = Original Score * (1 - 0.2 × _N_) for _N_ = 1, 2, 3, 4

Score = 0 for _N_ >= 5

For example, reports submitted from 9 Aug 11:59:01pm to 10 Aug 11:59:00pm will be counted as late for _N_ = 1 day and Score = Original Score × 0.8.

## policy on using generative AI

Students are prohibited from using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to produce any contents in their SGQ.

## marking scheme

- full mark = 10 = 1% of course overall score
