## Coulomb's law

1. 12 equal charges, $q$, are fixed to the corners of a regular 12-sided polygon (for instance, one on each numeral of a clock face). What is the net force on a test charge $Q$ at the center? :@: By symmetry, 0&nbsp;N. <p> To see this, rotate the system by 1/12 of a circle. The resulting system is the same as the original system. So the net force on $Q$ should be the same. This is only possible if the net force on $Q$ is zero, otherwise the net force would have rotated and become different. <!--SR:!2025-02-21,14,290-->
2. Suppose one of the 12 $q$'s is removed. What is the force on Q? Explain your reasoning carefully. :@: First, consider the system when one of the $q$ is _not_ removed. This is the same as the previous question. <p> Now imagine adding an opposite charge $-q$ at the same location as one of the $q$. By the superposition principle, the resulting system is the same as that obtained by removing that $q$ directly. <p> By the superposition principle again, the net force is the net force caused by the 12 $q$, which is 0 N, plus that caused by the added opposite charge $-q$, for which we can use Coulomb's law. <!--SR:!2025-02-22,15,290-->
3. Now 13 equal charges, $q$, are placed at the corners of a regular 13-sided polygon. What is the force on a test charge $Q$ at the center? :@: By symmetry, 0&nbsp;N. <p> To see this, rotate the system by 1/13 of a circle. The resulting system is the same as the original system. So the net force on $Q$ should be the same. This is only possible if the net force on $Q$ is zero, otherwise the net force would have rotated and become different. <!--SR:!2025-02-23,16,290-->

- idea ::@:: Use symmetry and superposition to solve physics problems! <!--SR:!2025-02-21,14,290!2025-02-23,16,290-->
