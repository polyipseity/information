- topic: introduction, electric charge and electric field
- course logistics
- [electric charge](../../../../general/electric%20charge.md) ::@:: positive/negative <br/> transferrable, via _electric current_ <br/> quantized, in multiples of the _elementary charge_ _e_ ≈ 1.602×10<sup>−19</sup>&nbsp;C <!--SR:!2025-03-23,32,270!2025-03-24,33,270-->
- [electroscope](../../../../general/electroscope.md) ::@:: It consists of a thin metal strip that is attached to a metallic rod. The metallic rod is contained in a glass window box and is electrically isolated from the supporting table. <!--SR:!2025-04-07,47,290!2025-03-23,32,270-->
  - electroscope / experiment ::@:: charged: Touching/almost touching it with a (positively or negatively) charged object, the metal strip deflects. <br/> uncharged: Grounding it with a metallic object, the metal strip is restored. <p> If the charged object touches it, charges are transferred to the metal strip, and like charges in the metal strip repel each other. Separately, the metal strip still deflects even if the charged object only almost touches it because this action can _induce_ electric charges. <!--SR:!2025-03-26,38,290!2025-03-22,31,270-->
- [Van de Graaff generator](../../../../general/Van%20de%20Graaff%20generator.md) ::@:: It uses the friction between a revolving belt and a pick-up brush to accumulate a net electric charge on the metal sphere. <!--SR:!2025-04-24,61,310!2025-04-08,45,290-->
  - Van de Graaff generator / experiment ::@:: When we place another metal sphere, grounded to the ground, next to the metal sphere of a running Van de Graaff generator, we can see periodic sparks between the two metal spheres and hear sounds. <p> Electric charges are flowing from the Van de Graaff generator to the other metal sphere through the air, which ionizes the air. This phenomenon is called _lightning_. <!--SR:!2025-05-01,67,310!2025-04-12,48,290-->
- [superposition principle](../../../../general/superposition%20principle.md) ::@:: It states that, for all linear systems, the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually. <!--SR:!2025-04-26,63,310!2025-04-18,55,310-->
  - superposition principle / total charge of a system ::@:: The total charge of a system is the summation of all individual charges. <!--SR:!2025-04-30,66,310!2025-04-21,58,310-->
  - superposition principle / electrostatic force ::@:: The electrostatic force on a test charge by a collection of charged objects is the vector sum over the electrostatic forces on the test charge by each charged object. <!--SR:!2025-04-06,46,290!2025-04-06,43,290-->
- [charge conservation](../../../../general/charge%20conservation.md) ::@:: In an _isolated_ (less accurately, _closed_) system the sum of positive and negative charges is constant. <!--SR:!2025-04-29,65,310!2025-04-05,45,290-->
- [Coulomb's law](../../../../general/Coulomb's%20law.md) ::@:: In a vacuum, $$\mathbf {F} _{1}={\frac {q_{1}q_{2} }{4\pi \varepsilon _{0} } }{ {\hat {\mathbf {r} } }_{12} \over {|\mathbf {r} _{12}|}^{2} }$$ where $\mathbf {r_{12}=r_{1}-r_{2} }$ is the [displacement vector](../../../../general/displacement%20vector.md) between the charges, ${\hat {\mathbf {r} } }_{12}$ a [unit vector](../../../../general/unit%20vector.md) pointing from $q_{2}$ to $q_{1}$, and $\varepsilon _{0} \approx 8.854 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{F/m}$ the [electric constant](../../../../general/electric%20constant.md) (a.k.a. _permittivity of the free space_). <!--SR:!2025-03-20,33,270!2025-04-23,60,310-->
  - Coulomb's law / experiment ::@:: Coulomb used the _torsion balance_ to study the effects of electric charges. It can measure very weak forces. <!--SR:!2025-04-19,56,310!2025-04-25,62,310-->

## week 1 lecture 2

- datetime: 2025-02-05T09:00:00+08:00/2025-02-05T10:20:00+08:00
- topic: electric field II
- [hierarchy problem](../../../../general/hierarchy%20problem.md) ::@:: Why is gravity so weak compared to electromagnetic force (and weak force and strong force)? <!--SR:!2025-03-03,17,313!2025-03-01,15,313-->
  - hierarchy problem / example ::@:: Consider two double positively charged helium ions. The electrostatic repulsion between them is about 10<sup>39</sup> times stronger than gravity. <!--SR:!2025-03-03,17,313!2025-03-01,15,313-->
  - hierarchy problem / idea ::@:: Even though gravity is very weak, it is the only force that matters at macroscopic scale. This is because gravity always attract but electrostatic force cancels out as objects have a net charge of zero. <!--SR:!2025-03-03,17,313!2025-03-01,15,313-->
- [scientific law](../../../../general/scientific%20law.md) ::@:: They are scientific generalizations based on _empirical observations_ of physical behavior. This highlights the _observational nature_ of the physical science. <!--SR:!2025-03-03,17,313!2025-03-02,16,313-->
- [electric field](../../../../general/electric%20field.md) ::@:: a vector field that associates to each point in space the force per unit of charge exerted on an infinitesimal test charge at rest at that point <!--SR:!2025-03-01,15,313!2025-03-02,16,313-->
  - electric field / experiment ::@:: We can "observe" the electric field by deflecting an electric beam. An electric beam are emitted electrons that pass through two plates electrodes with a potential difference. <p> The larger the potential difference, the more the electric beam deflects. Reversing the polarity of the potential difference leads to the electric beam being deflected the other way. <p> This shows the space between the plates are being permeated with a physical quantity that acts on charged particles, which should also be a vector. <!--SR:!2025-03-03,17,313!2025-03-02,16,313-->
  - electric field / calculation ::@:: $$\mathbf {E} _{1}(\mathbf {r} _{0})={\frac {\mathbf {F} _{01} }{q_{0} } }={\frac {q_{1} }{4\pi \varepsilon _{0} } }{ {\hat {\mathbf {r} } }_{01} \over {|\mathbf {r} _{01}|}^{2} }={\frac {q_{1} }{4\pi \varepsilon _{0} } }{\mathbf {r} _{01} \over {|\mathbf {r} _{01}|}^{3} }$$ where $\mathbf {E} _{1}(\mathbf {r} _{0})$ is the component of the electric field at $q_{0}$ due to $q_{1}$. <p> Make use of the superposition principle when there are multiple electric charges. <p> For continuous charge distribution, we replace the summation with a line, surface, or volume integral, and the charge with charge density (resp. per length, per area, per volume) instead. <!--SR:!2025-04-13,47,313!2025-03-01,15,313-->
  - electric field / visualization ::@:: As it is a vector field, we can visualize it as many arrows representing the vector at certain positions in a region of space. <p> For a positively charged particle, the surrounding arrows diverge outwards (positive divergence). For a negatively charged particle, the surrounding arrows converge inwards (negative divergence). <!--SR:!2025-03-02,16,313!2025-03-02,16,313-->
  - electric field / approximation ::@:: We can approximate electric fields in some situations. <p> For concreteness, consider two equal positively charged particles $q_1, q_2$ at distance $d$ from each other. The electric field at very far away from the two charged particles (the distance from the middle of the two particles $D$ is $D \gg d$) is approximately the same as that generated by one positively charged particle with double the charge located at the middle of $q_1$ and $q_2$. <p> Another example is similar to above, but with a line charge instead, which at far away distance approximately looks like a point charge. Make use of symmetry when trying to work out this example. <!--SR:!2025-03-02,16,313!2025-03-03,17,313-->
  - electric field / interpretation ::@:: What is the electric field? Humans cannot detect it, but some other animals can. <p> Maxwell believed that electromagnetic fields are stress and strains in a medium that called _ether_, which permeates throughout the universe. But special relativity had forced us to abandon this idea. <p> Our current interpretation (at least in this course) is that it is a vector field determined by physical laws. <!--SR:!2025-03-02,16,313!2025-03-01,15,313-->

## week 1 tutorial

- datetime: 2025-02-06T18:00:00+08:00/2025-02-06T18:50:00+08:00
- topic: differential calculus
- [differential calculus](../../../../general/differential%20calculus.md)
  - differential calculus / [differential form](../../../../general/differential%20form.md) ::@:: No need to go too formal into its mathematical treatment for physics at this stage... <p> Treat $\mathrm dx$ as an infinitesimal amount. Then $f' = \frac {\mathrm df} {\mathrm dx}$. <p> $\mathrm d^2 x$ is an infinitesimal area. $\mathrm d^3 x$ is an infinitesimal volume. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,18,323!2025-03-07,18,323-->
- [gradient](../../../../general/gradient.md) ::@:: It of a scalar-valued differentiable function $f$ of several variables is the vector field (or vector-valued function) $\nabla f$ whose value at a point $p$ gives the direction and the rate of fastest increase. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,18,323!2025-03-07,18,323-->
  - gradient / definition ::@:: You have a 3D scalar field $\varphi$. Gather its partial derivatives along the Cartesian axes to get the gradient vector field. <p> Mathematically, the gradient is $\nabla \varphi(x, y, z) = \left. \frac {\partial \varphi} {\partial x} \right|_{(x, y, z)} \vec x + \left. \frac {\partial \varphi} {\partial y} \right|_{(x, y, z)} \vec y + \left. \frac {\partial \varphi} {\partial z} \right|_{(x, y, z)} \vec z$. Using infinitesimals, we have $\mathrm d\varphi = \frac {\partial \varphi} {\partial x} \mathrm dx + \frac {\partial \varphi} {\partial y} \mathrm dy + \frac {\partial \varphi} {\partial z} \mathrm dz$. <!--SR:!2025-02-28,11,303!2025-03-07,18,323-->
- [del](../../../../general/del.md) ::@:: We can treat $\nabla$ as an linear vector operator (but it is _not_ simply a vector as it has neither a magnitude nor a direction by itself): $\begin{bmatrix} \frac \partial {\partial x} & \frac \partial {\partial y} & \frac \partial {\partial z} \end{bmatrix}^\intercal$. Then it becomes clear $\nabla$ acts on a scalar, which in this case is $\varphi : \mathbb R^3 \to \mathbb R$, and returns its gradient $\nabla \varphi : \mathbb R^3 \to \mathbb R^3$. <p> This would make more sense later when we have the Laplace operator, which is $\nabla^2 = \nabla \cdot \nabla = \begin{bmatrix} \frac \partial {\partial x} & \frac \partial {\partial y} & \frac \partial {\partial z} \end{bmatrix}^\intercal \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \frac \partial {\partial x} & \frac \partial {\partial y} & \frac \partial {\partial z} \end{bmatrix}^\intercal = \begin{bmatrix} \frac {\partial^2} {\partial x^2} & \frac {\partial^2} {\partial y^2} & \frac {\partial^2} {\partial z^2} \end{bmatrix}^\intercal$. In this, we can see that the dot product works as expected. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,18,323!2025-03-07,18,323-->
- [gradient](../../../../general/gradient.md)
  - gradient / rules ::@:: The rules are quite similar to single-variable calculus. For example, let $\varphi(\vec r) = \vec r \cdot \vec r = \lVert \vec r \rVert^2 = r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2$. Then $\nabla \varphi(\vec r) = 2 \vec r = 2r_1 + 2r_2 + 2r_3$. Compare this with the derivative of $f(x) = x^2$ being $2x$. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,18,323!2025-03-07,18,323-->
- [divergence](../../../../general/divergence.md) ::@:: It is a vector operator that operates on a vector field, producing a scalar field giving the quantity of the vector field's source at each point. More technically, the divergence represents the volume density of the outward flux of a vector field from an infinitesimal volume around a given point. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,18,323!2025-02-28,11,303-->
  - divergence / definition ::@:: $\nabla \cdot \mathbf v = \begin{bmatrix} \frac \partial {\partial x} & \frac \partial {\partial y} & \frac \partial {\partial z} \end{bmatrix}^\intercal \cdot \begin{bmatrix} v_x & v_y & v_z \end{bmatrix}^\intercal = \frac {\partial v_x} {\partial x} + \frac {\partial v_y} {\partial y} + \frac {\partial v_z} {\partial z}$ <p> It looks like the dot product works as expected. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,18,323!2025-03-07,18,323-->
- [curl](../../../../general/curl%20(mathematics).md) ::@::  It is vector operator that describes the infinitesimal circulation of a vector field in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The curl at a point in the field is represented by a vector whose length and direction denote the magnitude and axis of the maximum circulation. The curl of a field is formally defined as the circulation density at each point of the field. <!--SR:!2025-04-02,34,303!2025-02-28,11,303-->
  - curl / definition ::@:: $\nabla \times \mathbf v = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf x & \mathbf y & \mathbf z \\ \frac \partial {\partial x} & \frac \partial {\partial y} & \frac \partial {\partial z} \\ v_x & v_y & v_z \end{vmatrix} = \left\langle \frac {\partial v_z} {\partial y} - \frac {\partial v_y} {\partial z}, \frac {\partial v_x} {\partial z} - \frac {\partial v_z} {\partial x}, \frac {\partial v_y} {\partial x} - \frac {\partial v_x} {\partial y} \right\rangle$ <!--SR:!2025-03-22,25,283!2025-02-28,11,303-->
- [del](../../../../general/del.md)
  - del / properties
    - del / properties / linearity ::@:: It is a linear vector operator. So $\nabla$, $\nabla \cdot$, and $\nabla \times$ distributes over addition and is homogenous under _scalar_ (scalar in this context are scalar fields) multiplication. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,18,323!2025-03-07,18,323-->
    - del / properties / product rules (easier) ::@:: These 4 rules are the easier ones: $$\begin{aligned} \nabla (fg) & = f \nabla g + g \nabla f \\ \nabla \cdot (f \mathbf v) & = f (\nabla \cdot \mathbf v) + \mathbf v \cdot (\nabla f) \\ \nabla \times (f \mathbf v) & = f (\nabla \times \mathbf v) - \mathbf v \times (\nabla f) \\ \nabla \cdot (\mathbf u \times \mathbf v) & = -\mathbf u \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf v) + \mathbf v \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf u) \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-03-01,4,223!2025-02-28,4,263-->
    - del / properties / product rules (harder) ::@:: These 2 rules are the harder ones: $$\begin{aligned} \nabla (\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v) & = \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf v) + (\mathbf u \cdot \nabla) \mathbf v + \mathbf v \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u) + (\mathbf v \cdot \nabla)\mathbf u \\ \nabla \times (\mathbf u \times \mathbf v) & = \mathbf u \, (\nabla \cdot \mathbf v) - (\mathbf u \cdot \nabla) \, \mathbf v - \mathbf v \, (\nabla \cdot \mathbf u) + (\mathbf v \cdot \nabla) \, \mathbf u \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-03-06,7,243!2025-03-18,22,283-->

- datetime: 2025-02-10T09:00:00+08:00/2025-02-10T10:20:00+08:00
- topic: Maxwell equations of electrostatics
- [field line](../../../../general/field%20line.md) ::@:: It is a graphical visual aid for visualizing vector fields. It consists of an imaginary integral curve which is tangent to the field vector at each point along its length. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,342!2025-03-13,18,342-->
  - field line / examples
    - field line / examples / point source ::@:: The field lines radiate outwards/inwards. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,342!2025-03-13,18,342-->
    - field line / examples / parallel plate capacitor ::@:: The field lines are roughly straight from one plate to another when far away from the capacitor edges. Close to the edges, the field lines start bending. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,342!2025-03-13,18,342-->
  - field lines / caution ::@:: The field lines should not cross each other. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,342!2025-03-13,18,342-->
- [flux](../../../../general/flux.md) ::@:: It describes any effect that appears to pass or travel (whether it actually moves or not) through a surface or substance. Flux is a concept in applied mathematics and vector calculus which has many applications in physics. <p> In vector calculus flux is a scalar quantity, defined as the surface integral of the perpendicular component of a vector field over a surface. <!--SR:!2025-03-08,13,322!2025-03-13,18,342-->
  - flux / equation (for electric field) ::@:: $$\Phi_E \equiv \oiint_S \! \mathbf E \cdot \mathrm d \mathbf A \,,$$ where $\Phi_E$ is the flux out of the surface $S$, which encloses a volume; $\mathbf E$ is the electric field, $\cdot$ is the dot product, and $\mathrm d\mathbf A$ is an infinitesimal area of the surface oriented outwards (outward normal of the surface). <!--SR:!2025-03-08,13,322!2025-03-13,18,342-->
- [Gauss's law](../../../../general/Gauss's%20law.md) ::@:: In its integral form, it states that the flux of the electric field out of an arbitrary closed surface is proportional to the electric charge enclosed by the surface, irrespective of how that charge is distributed. <p> In its differential form, it states that the divergence of the electric field is proportional to the local density of charge. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,342!2025-03-07,12,322-->
  - Gauss's law / mathematical theorem ::@:: an application of the divergence theorem <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,342!2025-03-14,19,342-->
  - Gauss's law / interpretation ::@:: For the integral form: Consider a volume. The (net) flux out of its surface is only affected by the charge enclosed in the volume. Any charges outside the volume does not change the (net) flux, since for an outside charge, any flux entering the volume is canceled by the same amount of flux exiting the volume. <p> However, this does _not_ mean the flux on the surface is solely determined by the charge enclosed by the volume. Charge outside can modify the flux, it is just that the (net) flux out of the surface does not change. <p> For the derivative form: Charge causes divergence in the electric field. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,342!2025-03-13,18,342-->
  - Gauss's law / integral form ::@:: $$\oiint_S \! \mathbf E \cdot \mathrm d \mathbf A = \frac {Q_{\text{enc} } } {\varepsilon_0} \,,$$ where $Q_{\text{enc} }$ is the charge in the volume enclosed by the surface $S$. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,12,322!2025-03-14,19,342-->
  - Gauss's law / differential form ::@:: $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf E = \frac \rho {\varepsilon_0} \,,$$ where $\rho$ is the charge _density_. <p> This form may be obtained fro the integral form using the divergence theorem. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,342!2025-03-08,13,322-->
    - Gauss's law / differential form / from Coulomb's law ::@:: We can consider the electric field for a continuous charge distribution. Then apply the divergence operator, and make use of the identity: $$\nabla \cdot \left( \frac {\mathbf r} {\lvert \mathbf r \rvert^3} \right) = 4 \pi \delta(\mathbf r)$$ and the "sifting property" of the Dirac delta function. <p> The above identity says that the vector field given by $$\frac {\mathbf r} {\lvert \mathbf r \rvert^3}$$ has zero divergence except for the origin, which has a divergence such that when (volume-)integrated over results in $4\pi$. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,12,322!2025-03-07,12,322-->
- [Gaussian surface](../../../../general/Gaussian%20surface.md) ::@:: It is a closed surface in three-dimensional space through which the flux of a vector field is calculated. <p> They are usually carefully chosen to exploit _symmetries_ of a situation to simplify the calculation of the surface integral. If the Gaussian surface is chosen such that for every point on the surface the component of the electric field along the normal vector is _constant_, then the calculation will not require difficult integration as the constants which arise can be taken out of the integral. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,342!2025-03-13,18,342-->
  - Gaussian surface / spherical symmetry ::@:: If we use a sphere surface to calculate the electric field produced by a spherically symmetric charge that is fully enclosed by the surface, we find that the electric field it produces is as-if all charges were at the center. (For more, see shell theorem.) <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,342!2025-03-04,10,302-->

## week 2 lecture 2

- datetime: 2025-02-12T09:00:00+08:00/2025-02-12T10:20:00+08:00
- topic: electric potential
- [electric potential](../../../../general/electric%20potential.md) ::@:: It is the amount of work/energy needed per unit of electric charge to move the charge from a reference point to a specific point in an electric field. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,342!2025-03-14,19,342-->
  - electric potential / definition (electrostatic) ::@:: In an _static_ electric field, we have $$V_{\mathbf {E} }=-\int _{\mathcal {C} }\mathbf {E} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell } }\,.$$ Since the electric field is conservative, by the gradient theorem we have $$\mathbf {E} =-\mathbf {\nabla } V_{\mathbf {E} }\,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-03-07,12,322!2025-03-14,19,342-->
  - electric potential / continuous calculation ::@:: $$V_{\mathbf {E} }(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0} } }\int _{R}{\frac {\rho (\mathbf {r} ')}{|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r} '|} }\mathrm {d} ^{3}r'\,,$$ which can be derived by knowing that $\nabla \left(\frac 1 {\lvert \mathbf r \rvert} \right) = -\frac {\hat{\mathbf r} } {\lvert \mathbf r \rvert^2}$. (Notice the similarity to $\left(\frac 1 x \right)' = -\frac 1 {x^2}$.) <!--SR:!2025-03-07,12,322!2025-03-08,13,322-->
  - electric potential / curl ::@:: It is curl-free for a _static_ electric field. So it means the produced electric field by a potential is _conservative_. <p> Consider a closed loop (curve) $L$ in the static electric field and apply Stokes' theorem: $$\oint_L \! \mathbf E \cdot \mathrm d\mathbf l = \iint_S \! (\nabla \times \mathbf E) \cdot \mathrm d\mathbf A \,,$$ where $S$ is an oriented surface with $L$ as its boundary. Since the field is curl-free, the integrand in the right hand side is always 0. So the left hand side is 0. This means after following a closed loop in the electric field, the net work done is 0. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,12,322!2025-03-07,12,322-->
  - electric potential / [Maxwell's equations](../../../../general/Maxwell's%20equations.md) ::@:: For a _static_ electric field (no changing magnetic field), the curl-free nature of the field gives us the 2nd equation: $$\nabla \times \mathbf E = \mathbf 0 \,.$$ <p> (With a changing magnetic field, an additional term is needed.) <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,342!2025-03-14,19,342-->
  - electric potential / reference point ::@:: We can set any arbitrary point as the point where the electric potential is 0. Another common point to use as a reference is the point at infinity. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,342!2025-03-14,19,342-->
  - electric potential / finding electric field ::@:: We can use the gradient to find the electric field. Use symmetry if needed to simplify the calculation. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,342!2025-03-13,18,342-->
  - electric potential / [equipotential](../../../../general/equipotential.md) ::@:: We can visualize the electric potential using this. They are basically contour lines of the electric potential. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,342!2025-03-14,19,342-->
- [electric field](../../../../general/electric%20field.md)
  - electric field / near a surface ::@:: Consider a surface with surface charge density $\rho$. We consider the _difference_ of the electric field _just_ above and below the surface. <p> First, consider the difference's normal component. Using a Gaussian pillow box (a rectangle box) and shrinking one of its side such that the box approaches the surface, we can apply Gauss's law and find that the difference's normal component has a magnitude of $\frac {\rho} {\varepsilon_0}$. This means a discontinuity in the electric field crossing the surface. <p> Next, consider the difference's tangential component. Using a loop and shrinking one of its side such that the loop approaches a line on the surface, apply that the electric field is conservative and find that the difference's tangential component has 0 magnitude. This means continuity in the electric field moving along the surface. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,357!2025-03-07,9,317-->
    - electric field / near a surface / implications ::@:: Consider an ideal electric conductor with zero electric resistance. Any electrostatic field inside the conductor would arrange the charges inside to cancel out the electric field. Thus the electric field inside is 0. So if the conductor has any overall net charge, it must reside on the surface. <p> This is exactly the situation we have described above. We also have that the electric field outside infinitely close to the surface is ${\frac {\sigma }{\varepsilon _{0} } }{\hat {\mathbf {n} } }$, where $\hat {\mathbf n}$ is the outward normal, by the _difference_ of the electric field we have just calculated above. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,357!2025-03-12,13,337-->
- electric potential
  - electric potential / near a surface ::@:: Consider a surface with surface charge density $\rho$. We consider the _difference_ of the electric potential _just_ above and below the surface. <p> We simply notice that the path length approaches zero and the electric field magnitude is not unbounded (infinite), so as the distance approaches 0, the potential difference approaches 0. <!--SR:!2025-03-19,20,357!2025-03-13,14,337-->

  - line integral / single-variable calculus ::@:: The single-variable calculus you have been doing has always been a line integral! It is just that the space is 1D, i.e. the real number line, and obviously, the only curves in a 1D space are straight lines. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,357!2025-03-17,18,357-->

  - surface integral / over a vector field ::@:: $${\begin{aligned}\iint _{S}{\mathbf {v} }\cdot \mathrm {d} {\mathbf {s} }&=\iint _{S}\left({\mathbf {v} }\cdot {\mathbf {n} }\right)\,\mathrm {d} s\\&{}=\iint _{T}\left({\mathbf {v} }(\mathbf {r} (s,t))\cdot { {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial s} }\times {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial t} } \over \left\|{\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial s} }\times {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial t} }\right\|}\right)\left\|{\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial s} }\times {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial t} }\right\|\mathrm {d} s\,\mathrm {d} t\\&{}=\iint _{T}{\mathbf {v} }(\mathbf {r} (s,t))\cdot \left({\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial s} }\times {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial t} }\right)\mathrm {d} s\,\mathrm {d} t.\end{aligned} }$$ The cross product on the right-hand side of this expression is a \(not necessarily unital\) surface normal determined by the parameterization. <p> If $S$ is a closed surface, we can use $\oiint$ instead of $\iint$. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,9,317!2025-03-19,20,357-->

- topic: electric potential energy
- experiment: fluorescent tube ::@:: Bring a fluorescent tube near the surface of a van der Graff generator. The tube lights up, as the distance to the sphere of the van der Graff generator decreases. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,357!2025-03-12,13,337-->
  - experiment: fluorescent tube / interpretation ::@:: Strong electric fields created by the van der Garff generator causes arc discharges in the tube. Atoms becomes a plasma of positively charged ions and electrons. They gain kinetic energy due to Coulomb forces. This energy is transferred to mercury atoms via inelastic collisions. Mercury atoms emit this energy away via radiation. <!--SR:!2025-03-12,13,337!2025-03-13,14,337-->
- [work](../../../../general/work%20(physics).md)
  - work / line integral ::@:: If the force is variable, then work is given by the [line integral](../../../../general/line%20integral.md): $$W=\int {\vec {F} }\cdot d{\vec {s} }$$ where $d{\vec {s} }$ is the tiny change in displacement vector. <!--SR:!2025-03-19,20,357!2025-03-13,14,337-->
- electric potential
  - electric potential / work ::@:: The work of moving a charge $Q$ from $\mathbf a$ to $\mathbf b$ is $$W = Q(V(\mathbf b) - V(\mathbf a)) \,.$$ The negative sign (in the definition of electric potential $\nabla V = -\mathbf E$) is missing from here because moving a charge requires fighting _against_ the Coulomb force, so two negative signs cancel out. Further, the result is path independent because the Coulomb force is conservative. <p> Note this assumes two things: the charge being moved is assumed to not disturb the field; and the charge is moved with negligible acceleration, so as to avoid the test charge acquiring kinetic energy or producing radiation. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,357!2025-03-07,9,317-->
  - electric potential / reference point ::@:: A common reference point $\mathbf a$, where $V(\mathbf a) = 0$ is set, is at infinity. Then we obtain $$W = Q(V(\mathbf r) - V(\infty)) = QV(\mathbf r) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,357!2025-03-18,19,357-->
- [electric potential energy](../../../../general/electric%20potential%20energy.md) ::@:: It is a potential energy (measured in joules) that results from conservative Coulomb forces and is associated with the configuration of a particular set of point charges within a defined system. An object may be said to have \(_this_\) energy by virtue of either its own electric charge or its relative position to other electrically charged objects. <!--SR:!2025-03-19,20,357!2025-03-19,20,357-->
  - electric potential energy / point charges ::@:: $$U_E = \frac 1 2 \sum_{i = 1}^n q_i V_i(\mathbf r_i) \,,$$ for $n$ charges, each of charge $q_i$ at position $\mathbf r_i$, and $V_i$ is the electrostatic potential due to all point charges except the one at $\mathbf r_i$. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,357!2025-03-17,18,357-->
    - electric potential energy / point charges / derivation ::@:: Consider bringing the $n$ charges from infinity to $\mathbf r_i$ one-by-one. <p> The 1st charge takes no work. The 2nd charge takes some work due to the 1st charge. The 3rd charge takes some work due to the 1st charge and 2nd charge. So we can see the $i$-th charge take work that is proportional to the sum of 1 to $i - 1$-th charges. This forms a triangular sum when visualized in a $n \times n$ 2D grid. Double each term to get a square sum, where the diagonals are 0 (self-interactions take no work). So we have $$U_E = \frac 1 2 \frac 1 {4\pi \varepsilon_0} \sum_{\substack{1 \le i,j \le n \\ i \ne j} } \frac {q_i q_j} {\lvert \mathbf r_i - \mathbf r_j \rvert} = \frac 1 2 \frac 1 {4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \sum_{i = 1}^n q_i \sum_{\substack{j = 1 \\ i \ne j}^n } \frac {q_j} {\lvert \mathbf r_i - \mathbf r_j \rvert} = \frac 1 2 \sum_{i = 1}^n q_i V_i(\mathbf r_i) \,,$$ where $V_i$ is the electrostatic potential due to all point charges except the one at $\mathbf r_i$. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,14,337!2025-03-07,9,317-->
  - electric potential energy / continuous charge ::@:: The energy density, or energy per unit volume, ${\frac {dU}{dV} }$, of the [electrostatic field](../../../../general/electrostatic%20field.md#electrostatic%20fields) of a continuous charge distribution is: $$u_{e}={\frac {dU}{dV} }={\frac {1}{2} }\varepsilon _{0}\left|{\mathbf {E} }\right|^{2} \,.$$ To get the configuration energy for the whole continuous charge, integrate the above over the entire space. <p> An alternative way, if the charge density $\rho$ and potential $V$ are known beforehand, is $$U_E = \frac 1 2 \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! \rho(\mathbf r) V(\mathbf r) \,\mathrm dV \,.$$ (Of course, you can restrict the integration domain to where $\rho$ is nonzero.) <!--SR:!2025-03-07,9,317!2025-03-07,9,317-->
    - electric potential energy / continuous charge / derivation ::@:: A similar argument to that for point charges but with infinitesimal charges would yield: $$U_E = \frac 1 2 \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! \rho(\mathbf r) V(\mathbf r) \,\mathrm dV \,.$$ Manipulate it using vector calculus: $$\begin{aligned} U_E & = \frac 1 2 \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! \rho(\mathbf r) V(\mathbf r) \,\mathrm dV \\ & = \frac {\varepsilon_0} 2 \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf E) \,\mathrm{d}V \\ & = \frac {\varepsilon_0} 2 \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! (\nabla \cdot (V \mathbf E) - \mathbf E \cdot (\nabla V)) \,\mathrm dV \\ & = \frac {\varepsilon_0} 2 \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! \lvert \mathbf E \rvert^2 \,\mathrm dV \,. \end{aligned}$$ The last equality uses the divergence theorem: $$\left\lvert \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! \nabla \cdot (V \mathbf E) \,\mathrm dV \right\rvert = \left\lvert \oiint\limits_{\text{boundary} } \! V \mathbf E \cdot \mathrm d\mathbf A \right\rvert \le \max_{\text{boundary} } \lvert V \rvert \left\lvert \oiint\limits_{\text{boundary} } \! \mathbf E \cdot \mathrm d\mathbf A \right\rvert = 0 \,.$$ The last equality is because $V \to 0$ as $r \to \infty$ (expanding the boundary to cover all space) but the integral is bounded ($\frac {Q_{\text{enc} } } {\varepsilon_0}$ by Gauss's law). <p> Finally, for the above integral to hold for all space, the integrand must equal $\frac {\mathrm dU_E} {\mathrm dV}$. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,9,317!2025-03-07,9,317-->
  - electric potential energy / self-energy of point charges ::@:: Note that point charges have infinite self-energy. That is, to assemble a point charge from infinitesimal charges infinitely far away, you need infinite work. This can be found out using the equation for continuous charge to calculate the self-energy of a spherical shell charge of finite radius, and then shrinking it to a point charge. <p> This explains discrepancy between the equations for point charges and continuous charge. For example, trying to apply the continuous charge equation for a lone point charge results does not work well (the electric field is infinite at the point charge), while that using the point charge equation is zero work. We can say that the equation for point charges _excludes_ the self-energy of point charges, because it is meaningless (infinite). <!--SR:!2025-03-19,20,357!2025-03-18,19,357-->

- topic: Dirac delta function, Taylor expansion
- [Dirac delta function](../../../../general/Dirac%20delta%20function.md) ::@:: It is _generalized function_ (which is not a _function_) that is zero everywhere except at zero, and its "value" (it is not a _value_ in the sense of a _function_) at zero is infinite such that the integral over the entire real number line is 1. <p> It makes less sense to think of it as a function by itself, and more sense to think of it as an _action_ on another function inside an integral. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,357!2025-03-19,20,357-->
  - Dirac delta function / motivation ::@:: How do we represent a point charge as charge density? Such a point charge must have infinite charge density since the charge is nonzero but volume is zero. <p> Dirac delta function can be used to represent such point charges. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,357!2025-03-13,14,337-->
  - Dirac delta function / sifting property ::@:: $$\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(t)\,\delta (t-T)\,dt=f(T) \,.$$ The delta function is said to "sift out" the value of _f\(t\)_ at _t_ = _T_. <p> (there are some conditions of $f$  that we will ignore here) <!--SR:!2025-03-19,20,357!2025-03-19,20,357-->
  - Dirac delta function / multiple dimension ::@:: Multiply the 1-dimensional Dirac delta functions multiple times. Each "sifts out" the value of _f_ of a coordinate (noting that a point in multiple dimensions is represented by multiple coordinates) at a fixed value. <p> In that case, all coordinates of a point must match for the value of _f_ to be "sifted out" in the integrand of an integral. Otherwise the integrand is 0 (since at least one Dirac delta function does not "sift out" the value of _f_). <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,357!2025-03-13,14,337-->
- [Taylor series](../../../../general/Taylor%20series.md) ::@:: It of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at a single point. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,357!2025-03-18,19,357-->
  - Taylor series / motivation ::@:: We want to approximate a function near a point by a simpler function, and also want to know estimate the approximation error. <!--SR:!2025-03-12,13,337!2025-03-19,20,357-->
  - Taylor series / expression ::@:: Given a a [real](../../../../general/real-valued%20function.md) or [complex-valued function](../../../../general/complex-valued%20function.md) _f_<!-- markdown separator --> \(_x_\), that is [infinitely differentiable](../../../../general/infinitely%20differentiable%20function.md) at a [real](../../../../general/real%20number.md) or [complex number](../../../../general/complex%20number.md) _a_, it is $$f(a)+{\frac {f'(a)}{1!} }(x-a)+{\frac {f''(a)}{2!} }(x-a)^{2}+\cdots =\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} }(x-a)^{n}.$$ Here, _n_! denotes the [factorial](../../../../general/factorial.md) of _n_. The function _f_<sup>\(_n_\)</sup>\(_a_\) denotes the _n_-th [derivative](../../../../general/derivative.md) of _f_ evaluated at the point _a_. The derivative of order zero of _f_ is defined to be _f_ itself and \(_x_ − _a_\)<sup>0</sup> and 0! [are both defined to be 1](../../../../general/empty%20product.md). <p> _a_ is usually chosen to be 0. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,9,317!2025-03-07,9,317-->
  - Taylor series / conditions ::@:: Apart from being infinitely differentiable, the infinite series should also converge. The input values for which the series converge is the _region of convergence_. <p> Also, even if the series converges, it may not converge to the actual function value. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,357!2025-03-19,20,357-->
  - Taylor series / approximation ::@:: To approximate a function near a point, assuming the series converges, we truncate the series to a certain number of terms. The approximation is more accurate for inputs closer to _a_. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,357!2025-03-13,14,337-->
    - Taylor series / approximation / error ::@:: We use the _Lagrange form_ of Taylor's theorem. Assume we truncate the terms up to $x^k$ (the $x^k$ term is not truncated away). <p> Let _f_ : __R__ → __R__ be _k_ + 1 times [differentiable](../../../../general/differentiable%20function.md) on the [open interval](../../../../general/open%20interval.md#open%20interval) with _f_<sup>\(_k_\)</sup> [continuous](../../../../general/continuous%20function.md) on the [closed interval](../../../../general/closed%20interval.md#definitions%20and%20terminology) between $a$ and $x$. Then $$R_{k}(x)={\frac {f^{(k+1)}(\xi _{L})}{(k+1)!} }(x-a)^{k+1}$$ for some real number $\xi _{L}$ between $a$ and $x$. <p> We can thus find the maximum error by finding the maximum value of the above function in its domain. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,9,317!2025-03-07,9,317-->
