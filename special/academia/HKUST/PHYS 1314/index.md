- topic: Introduction, Electric Charge and Electric Field
- course logistics
- [electric charge](../../../../general/electric%20charge.md) ::@:: positive/negative <br/> transferrable, via _electric current_ <br/> quantized, in multiples of the _elementary charge_ _e_ ≈ 1.602×10<sup>−19</sup>&nbsp;C
- [electroscope](../../../../general/electroscope.md) ::@:: It consists of a thin metal strip that is attached to a metallic rod. The metallic rod is contained in a glass window box and is electrically isolated from the supporting table.
  - electroscope / experiment ::@:: charged: Touching/almost touching it with an charged object, the metal strip deflects. <br/> discharged: Grounding it with a metallic object, the metal strip is restored. <p> This is because like charges in the metal strip repel each other. The metal strip still deflects even if the charged object only almost touches it because this action can _induce_ electric charges.
- [Van de Graaff generator](../../../../general/Van%20de%20Graaff%20generator.md) ::@:: It uses the friction between a revolving belt and a pick-up brush to accumulate a net electric charge on the metal sphere.
  - Van de Graaff generator / experiment ::@:: When we place another metal sphere, grounded to the ground, next to a running Van de Graaff generator, we can see periodic sparks between the two metal spheres and hear sounds. <p> Electric charges are flowing from the Van de Graaff generator to the other metal sphere through the air, which ionizes the air. This phenomenon is called _lightning_.
- [superposition principle](../../../../general/superposition%20principle.md) ::@:: It states that, for all linear systems, the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually.
  - superposition principle / total charge of a system ::@:: The total charge of a system is the summation of all individual charges.
  - superposition principle / electrostatic force ::@:: The electrostatic force on a test charge by a collection of charged objects is the vector sum over the electrostatic forces on the test charge by each charged object.
- [charge conservation](../../../../general/charge%20conservation.md) ::@:: In an isolated (less accurately, _closed_) system the sum of positive and negative charges is constant.
- [Coulomb's law](../../../../general/Coulomb's%20law.md) ::@:: In a vacuum, $$\mathbf {F} _{1}={\frac {q_{1}q_{2} }{4\pi \varepsilon _{0} } }{ {\hat {\mathbf {r} } }_{12} \over {|\mathbf {r} _{12}|}^{2} }$$ where $\mathbf {r_{12}=r_{1}-r_{2} }$ is the [displacement vector](../../../../general/displacement%20vector.md) between the charges, ${\hat {\mathbf {r} } }_{12}$ a [unit vector](../../../../general/unit%20vector.md) pointing from $q_{2}$ to $q_{1}$, and $\varepsilon _{0}$ the [electric constant](../../../../general/electric%20constant.md) (a.k.a. _permittivity of the free space_).
  - Coulomb's law / experiment ::@:: Coulomb used the _torsion balance_ to study the effects of electric charges. It can measure very weak forces.
- [questions § Coulomb's law](questions.md#Coulomb's%20law)
