- topic: Introduction, Electric Charge and Electric Field
- course logistics
- [electric charge](../../../../general/electric%20charge.md) ::@:: positive/negative <br/> transferrable, via _electric current_ <br/> quantized, in multiples of the _elementary charge_ _e_ ≈ 1.602×10<sup>−19</sup>&nbsp;C <!--SR:!2025-02-19,12,270!2025-02-19,12,270-->
- [electroscope](../../../../general/electroscope.md) ::@:: It consists of a thin metal strip that is attached to a metallic rod. The metallic rod is contained in a glass window box and is electrically isolated from the supporting table. <!--SR:!2025-02-19,12,270!2025-02-19,12,270-->
  - electroscope / experiment ::@:: charged: Touching/almost touching it with a (positively or negatively) charged object, the metal strip deflects. <br/> uncharged: Grounding it with a metallic object, the metal strip is restored. <p> If the charged object touches it, charges are transferred to the metal strip, and like charges in the metal strip repel each other. Separately, the metal strip still deflects even if the charged object only almost touches it because this action can _induce_ electric charges. <!--SR:!2025-02-16,10,270!2025-02-19,12,270-->
- [Van de Graaff generator](../../../../general/Van%20de%20Graaff%20generator.md) ::@:: It uses the friction between a revolving belt and a pick-up brush to accumulate a net electric charge on the metal sphere. <!--SR:!2025-02-22,15,290!2025-02-22,15,290-->
  - Van de Graaff generator / experiment ::@:: When we place another metal sphere, grounded to the ground, next to the metal sphere of a running Van de Graaff generator, we can see periodic sparks between the two metal spheres and hear sounds. <p> Electric charges are flowing from the Van de Graaff generator to the other metal sphere through the air, which ionizes the air. This phenomenon is called _lightning_. <!--SR:!2025-02-23,16,290!2025-02-23,16,290-->
- [superposition principle](../../../../general/superposition%20principle.md) ::@:: It states that, for all linear systems, the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually. <!--SR:!2025-02-22,15,290!2025-02-21,14,290-->
  - superposition principle / total charge of a system ::@:: The total charge of a system is the summation of all individual charges. <!--SR:!2025-02-23,16,290!2025-02-21,14,290-->
  - superposition principle / electrostatic force ::@:: The electrostatic force on a test charge by a collection of charged objects is the vector sum over the electrostatic forces on the test charge by each charged object. <!--SR:!2025-02-19,12,270!2025-02-21,14,290-->
- [charge conservation](../../../../general/charge%20conservation.md) ::@:: In an _isolated_ (less accurately, _closed_) system the sum of positive and negative charges is constant. <!--SR:!2025-02-23,16,290!2025-02-19,12,270-->
- [Coulomb's law](../../../../general/Coulomb's%20law.md) ::@:: In a vacuum, $$\mathbf {F} _{1}={\frac {q_{1}q_{2} }{4\pi \varepsilon _{0} } }{ {\hat {\mathbf {r} } }_{12} \over {|\mathbf {r} _{12}|}^{2} }$$ where $\mathbf {r_{12}=r_{1}-r_{2} }$ is the [displacement vector](../../../../general/displacement%20vector.md) between the charges, ${\hat {\mathbf {r} } }_{12}$ a [unit vector](../../../../general/unit%20vector.md) pointing from $q_{2}$ to $q_{1}$, and $\varepsilon _{0} \approx 8.854 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{F/m}$ the [electric constant](../../../../general/electric%20constant.md) (a.k.a. _permittivity of the free space_). <!--SR:!2025-02-15,9,250!2025-02-22,15,290-->
  - Coulomb's law / experiment ::@:: Coulomb used the _torsion balance_ to study the effects of electric charges. It can measure very weak forces. <!--SR:!2025-02-21,14,290!2025-02-22,15,290-->
