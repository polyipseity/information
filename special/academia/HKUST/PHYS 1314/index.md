- topic: introduction, electric charge and electric field
- course logistics
- [electric charge](../../../../general/electric%20charge.md) ::@:: positive/negative <br/> transferrable, via _electric current_ <br/> quantized, in multiples of the _elementary charge_ _e_ ≈ 1.602×10<sup>−19</sup>&nbsp;C <!--SR:!2025-07-22,120,290!2025-07-24,122,290-->
- [electroscope](../../../../general/electroscope.md) ::@:: It consists of a thin metal strip that is attached to a metallic rod. The metallic rod is contained in a glass window box and is electrically isolated from the supporting table. <!--SR:!2025-10-15,190,310!2025-07-23,121,290-->
  - electroscope / experiment ::@:: charged: Touching/almost touching it with a (positively or negatively) charged object, the metal strip deflects. <br/> uncharged: Grounding it with a metallic object, the metal strip is restored. <p> If the charged object touches it, charges are transferred to the metal strip, and like charges in the metal strip repel each other. Separately, the metal strip still deflects even if the charged object only almost touches it because this action can _induce_ electric charges. <!--SR:!2025-08-26,153,310!2026-05-20,328,290-->
- [Van de Graaff generator](../../../../general/Van%20de%20Graaff%20generator.md) ::@:: It uses the friction between a revolving belt and a pick-up brush to accumulate a net electric charge on the metal sphere. <!--SR:!2026-01-14,265,330!2025-10-05,180,310-->
  - Van de Graaff generator / experiment ::@:: When we place another metal sphere, grounded to the ground, next to the metal sphere of a running Van de Graaff generator, we can see periodic sparks between the two metal spheres and hear sounds. <p> Electric charges are flowing from the Van de Graaff generator to the other metal sphere through the air, which ionizes the air. This phenomenon is called _lightning_. <!--SR:!2026-02-26,294,330!2025-10-21,192,310-->
- [superposition principle](../../../../general/superposition%20principle.md) ::@:: It states that, for all linear systems, the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,276,330!2025-12-10,236,330-->
  - superposition principle / total charge of a system ::@:: The total charge of a system is the summation of all individual charges. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,290,330!2025-12-21,243,330-->
  - superposition principle / electrostatic force ::@:: The electrostatic force on a test charge by a collection of charged objects is the vector sum over the electrostatic forces on the test charge by each charged object. <!--SR:!2025-10-07,182,310!2025-09-26,171,310-->
- [charge conservation](../../../../general/charge%20conservation.md) ::@:: In an _isolated_ (less accurately, _closed_) system the sum of positive and negative charges is constant. <!--SR:!2026-02-09,285,330!2025-10-02,177,310-->
- [Coulomb's law](../../../../general/Coulomb's%20law.md) ::@:: In a _vacuum_, $$\mathbf {F} _{1}={\frac {q_{1}q_{2} }{4\pi \varepsilon _{0} } }{ {\hat {\mathbf {r} } }_{12} \over {|\mathbf {r} _{12}|}^{2} }$$ where $\mathbf {r_{12}=r_{1}-r_{2} }$ is the [displacement vector](../../../../general/displacement%20vector.md) between the charges, ${\hat {\mathbf {r} } }_{12}$ a [unit vector](../../../../general/unit%20vector.md) pointing from $q_{2}$ to $q_{1}$, and $\varepsilon _{0} \approx 8.854 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{F/m}$ the [electric constant](../../../../general/electric%20constant.md) (a.k.a. _permittivity of the free space_). <!--SR:!2025-07-25,127,290!2026-01-10,262,330-->
  - Coulomb's law / experiment ::@:: Coulomb used the _torsion balance_ to study the effects of electric charges. It can measure very weak forces. <!--SR:!2025-12-15,240,330!2026-01-21,271,330-->

## week 1 lecture 2

- datetime: 2025-02-05T09:00:00+08:00/2025-02-05T10:20:00+08:00
- topic: electric field II
- [hierarchy problem](../../../../general/hierarchy%20problem.md) ::@:: Why is gravity so weak compared to electromagnetic force (and weak force and strong force)? <!--SR:!2026-05-20,356,353!2026-03-12,308,353-->
  - hierarchy problem / example ::@:: Consider two double positively charged helium ions. The electrostatic repulsion between them is about 10<sup>39</sup> times stronger than gravity. <!--SR:!2026-05-23,359,353!2026-03-22,318,353-->
  - hierarchy problem / idea ::@:: Even though gravity is very weak, it is the only force that matters at macroscopic scale. This is because gravity always attract but electrostatic force cancels out as objects have a net charge of zero. <!--SR:!2026-05-22,358,353!2026-03-18,314,353-->
- [scientific law](../../../../general/scientific%20law.md) ::@:: They are scientific generalizations based on _empirical observations_ of physical behavior. This highlights the _observational nature_ of the physical science. <!--SR:!2026-05-21,357,353!2026-04-22,328,353-->
- [electric field](../../../../general/electric%20field.md) ::@:: a vector field that associates to each point in space the force per unit of charge exerted on an infinitesimal test charge at rest at that point <!--SR:!2026-03-08,304,353!2025-11-28,217,333-->
  - electric field / experiment ::@:: We can "observe" the electric field by deflecting an electric beam. An electric beam are emitted electrons that pass through two plates electrodes with a potential difference. <p> The larger the potential difference, the more the electric beam deflects. Reversing the polarity of the potential difference leads to the electric beam being deflected the other way. <p> This shows the space between the plates are being permeated with a physical quantity that acts on charged particles, which should also be a vector. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,239,333!2025-09-21,151,313-->
  - electric field / calculation ::@:: In a _vacuum_, $$\mathbf {E} _{1}(\mathbf {r} _{0})={\frac {\mathbf {F} _{01} }{q_{0} } }={\frac {q_{1} }{4\pi \varepsilon _{0} } }{ {\hat {\mathbf {r} } }_{01} \over {|\mathbf {r} _{01}|}^{2} }={\frac {q_{1} }{4\pi \varepsilon _{0} } }{\mathbf {r} _{01} \over {|\mathbf {r} _{01}|}^{3} }$$ where $\mathbf {E} _{1}(\mathbf {r} _{0})$ is the component of the electric field at $q_{0}$ due to $q_{1}$. <p> Make use of the superposition principle when there are multiple electric charges. <p> For continuous charge distribution, we replace the summation with a line, surface, or volume integral, and the charge with charge density (resp. per length, per area, per volume) instead. <!--SR:!2025-09-08,147,313!2026-03-18,314,353-->
  - electric field / visualization ::@:: As it is a vector field, we can visualize it as many arrows representing the vector at certain positions in a region of space. <p> For a positively charged particle, the surrounding arrows diverge outwards (positive divergence). For a negatively charged particle, the surrounding arrows converge inwards (negative divergence). <!--SR:!2026-04-14,320,353!2025-12-06,220,333-->
  - electric field / approximation ::@:: We can approximate electric fields in some situations. <p> For concreteness, consider two equal positively charged particles $q_1, q_2$ at distance $d$ from each other. The electric field at very far away from the two charged particles (the distance from the middle of the two particles $D$ is $D \gg d$) is approximately the same as that generated by one positively charged particle with double the charge located at the middle of $q_1$ and $q_2$. <p> Another example is similar to above, but with a line charge instead, which at far away distance approximately looks like a point charge. Make use of symmetry when trying to work out this example. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,208,333!2025-12-26,240,333-->
  - electric field / interpretation ::@:: What is the electric field? Humans cannot detect it, but some other animals can. <p> Maxwell believed that electromagnetic fields are stress and strains in a medium that called _ether_, which permeates throughout the universe. But special relativity had forced us to abandon this idea. <p> Our current interpretation (at least in this course) is that it is a vector field determined by physical laws. <!--SR:!2026-04-25,331,353!2026-03-18,314,353-->

## week 1 tutorial

- datetime: 2025-02-06T18:00:00+08:00/2025-02-06T18:50:00+08:00
- topic: differential calculus
- [differential calculus](../../../../general/differential%20calculus.md)
  - differential calculus / [differential form](../../../../general/differential%20form.md) ::@:: No need to go too formal into its mathematical treatment for physics at this stage... <p> Treat $\mathrm dx$ as an infinitesimal amount. Then $f' = \frac {\mathrm df} {\mathrm dx}$. <p> $\mathrm d^2 x$ is an infinitesimal area. $\mathrm d^3 x$ is an infinitesimal volume. <!--SR:!2026-07-01,398,363!2026-06-30,397,363-->
- [gradient](../../../../general/gradient.md) ::@:: It of a scalar-valued differentiable function $f$ of several variables is the vector field (or vector-valued function) $\nabla f$ whose value at a point $p$ gives the direction and the rate of fastest increase. <!--SR:!2026-06-29,396,363!2026-06-29,396,363-->
  - gradient / definition ::@:: You have a 3D scalar field $\varphi$. Gather its partial derivatives along the Cartesian axes to get the gradient vector field. <p> Mathematically, the gradient is $\nabla \varphi(x, y, z) = \left. \frac {\partial \varphi} {\partial x} \right|_{(x, y, z)} \vec x + \left. \frac {\partial \varphi} {\partial y} \right|_{(x, y, z)} \vec y + \left. \frac {\partial \varphi} {\partial z} \right|_{(x, y, z)} \vec z$. Using infinitesimals, we have $\mathrm d\varphi = \frac {\partial \varphi} {\partial x} \mathrm dx + \frac {\partial \varphi} {\partial y} \mathrm dy + \frac {\partial \varphi} {\partial z} \mathrm dz$. <!--SR:!2025-11-01,201,343!2026-06-30,397,363-->
- [del](../../../../general/del.md) ::@:: We can treat $\nabla$ as an linear vector operator (but it is _not_ simply a vector as it has neither a magnitude nor a direction by itself): $\begin{bmatrix} \frac \partial {\partial x} & \frac \partial {\partial y} & \frac \partial {\partial z} \end{bmatrix}^\intercal$. Then it becomes clear $\nabla$ acts on a scalar, which in this case is $\varphi : \mathbb R^3 \to \mathbb R$, and returns its gradient $\nabla \varphi : \mathbb R^3 \to \mathbb R^3$. <p> This would make more sense later when we have the Laplace operator, which is $\nabla^2 = \nabla \cdot \nabla = \begin{bmatrix} \frac \partial {\partial x} & \frac \partial {\partial y} & \frac \partial {\partial z} \end{bmatrix}^\intercal \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \frac \partial {\partial x} & \frac \partial {\partial y} & \frac \partial {\partial z} \end{bmatrix}^\intercal = \begin{bmatrix} \frac {\partial^2} {\partial x^2} & \frac {\partial^2} {\partial y^2} & \frac {\partial^2} {\partial z^2} \end{bmatrix}^\intercal$. In this, we can see that the dot product works as expected. <!--SR:!2026-06-29,396,363!2026-07-01,398,363-->
- [gradient](../../../../general/gradient.md)
  - gradient / rules ::@:: The rules are quite similar to single-variable calculus. For example, let $\varphi(\vec r) = \vec r \cdot \vec r = \lVert \vec r \rVert^2 = r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2$. Then $\nabla \varphi(\vec r) = 2 \vec r = 2r_1 + 2r_2 + 2r_3$. Compare this with the derivative of $f(x) = x^2$ being $2x$. <!--SR:!2026-07-02,399,363!2026-07-01,398,363-->
- [divergence](../../../../general/divergence.md) ::@:: It is a vector operator that operates on a vector field, producing a scalar field giving the quantity of the vector field's source at each point. More technically, the divergence represents the volume density of the outward flux of a vector field from an infinitesimal volume around a given point. <!--SR:!2026-07-02,399,363!2025-08-24,142,323-->
  - divergence / definition ::@:: $\nabla \cdot \mathbf v = \begin{bmatrix} \frac \partial {\partial x} & \frac \partial {\partial y} & \frac \partial {\partial z} \end{bmatrix}^\intercal \cdot \begin{bmatrix} v_x & v_y & v_z \end{bmatrix}^\intercal = \frac {\partial v_x} {\partial x} + \frac {\partial v_y} {\partial y} + \frac {\partial v_z} {\partial z}$ <p> It looks like the dot product works as expected. <!--SR:!2026-06-29,396,363!2026-07-02,399,363-->
- [curl](../../../../general/curl%20(mathematics).md) ::@::  It is vector operator that describes the infinitesimal circulation of a vector field in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The curl at a point in the field is represented by a vector whose length and direction denote the magnitude and axis of the maximum circulation. The curl of a field is formally defined as the circulation density at each point of the field. <!--SR:!2025-08-22,142,323!2025-08-23,141,323-->
  - curl / definition ::@:: $\nabla \times \mathbf v = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf x & \mathbf y & \mathbf z \\ \frac \partial {\partial x} & \frac \partial {\partial y} & \frac \partial {\partial z} \\ v_x & v_y & v_z \end{vmatrix} = \left\langle \frac {\partial v_z} {\partial y} - \frac {\partial v_y} {\partial z}, \frac {\partial v_x} {\partial z} - \frac {\partial v_z} {\partial x}, \frac {\partial v_y} {\partial x} - \frac {\partial v_x} {\partial y} \right\rangle$ <!--SR:!2025-12-27,206,283!2025-11-04,204,343-->
- [del](../../../../general/del.md)
  - del / properties
    - del / properties / linearity ::@:: It is a linear vector operator. So $\nabla$, $\nabla \cdot$, and $\nabla \times$ distributes over addition and is homogenous under _scalar_ (scalar in this context are scalar fields) multiplication. <!--SR:!2026-06-30,397,363!2026-06-30,397,363-->
    - del / properties / product rules (easier) ::@:: These 4 rules are the easier ones: $$\begin{aligned} \nabla (fg) & = f \nabla g + g \nabla f \\ \nabla \cdot (f \mathbf v) & = f (\nabla \cdot \mathbf v) + \mathbf v \cdot (\nabla f) \\ \nabla \times (f \mathbf v) & = f (\nabla \times \mathbf v) - \mathbf v \times (\nabla f) \\ \nabla \cdot (\mathbf u \times \mathbf v) & = -\mathbf u \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf v) + \mathbf v \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf u) \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-02,28,203!2025-07-04,83,263-->
    - del / properties / product rules (harder) ::@:: These 2 rules are the harder ones: $$\begin{aligned} \nabla (\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v) & = \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf v) + (\mathbf u \cdot \nabla) \mathbf v + \mathbf v \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u) + (\mathbf v \cdot \nabla)\mathbf u \\ \nabla \times (\mathbf u \times \mathbf v) & = \mathbf u \, (\nabla \cdot \mathbf v) - (\mathbf u \cdot \nabla) \, \mathbf v - \mathbf v \, (\nabla \cdot \mathbf u) + (\mathbf v \cdot \nabla) \, \mathbf u \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-22,26,183!2025-11-29,184,283-->

## week 2 lecture

- datetime: 2025-02-10T09:00:00+08:00/2025-02-10T10:20:00+08:00
- topic: Maxwell equations of electrostatics
- [field line](../../../../general/field%20line.md) ::@:: It is a graphical visual aid for visualizing vector fields. It consists of an imaginary integral curve which is tangent to the field vector at each point along its length. <!--SR:!2026-05-17,336,362!2026-07-31,421,382-->
  - field line / examples
    - field line / examples / point source ::@:: The field lines radiate outwards/inwards. <!--SR:!2026-09-28,459,382!2026-08-08,428,382-->
    - field line / examples / parallel plate capacitor ::@:: The field lines are roughly straight from one plate to another when far away from the capacitor edges. Close to the edges, the field lines start bending. <!--SR:!2026-09-27,458,382!2026-08-07,427,382-->
  - field lines / caution ::@:: The field lines should not cross each other. <!--SR:!2026-07-30,420,382!2026-08-30,431,382-->
- [flux](../../../../general/flux.md) ::@:: It describes any effect that appears to pass or travel (whether it actually moves or not) through a surface or substance. Flux is a concept in applied mathematics and vector calculus which has many applications in physics. <p> In vector calculus flux is a scalar quantity, defined as the surface integral of the perpendicular component of a vector field over a surface. <!--SR:!2026-02-09,277,362!2026-09-09,441,382-->
  - flux / equation (for electric field) ::@:: $$\Phi_E \equiv \oiint_S \! \mathbf E \cdot \mathrm d \mathbf A \,,$$ where $\Phi_E$ is the flux out of the surface $S$, which encloses a volume; $\mathbf E$ is the electric field, $\cdot$ is the dot product, and $\mathrm d\mathbf A$ is an infinitesimal area of the surface oriented outwards (outward normal of the surface). <!--SR:!2026-02-15,283,362!2026-08-21,432,382-->
- [Gauss's law](../../../../general/Gauss's%20law.md) ::@:: In its integral form, it states that the flux of the electric field out of an arbitrary closed surface is proportional to the electric charge enclosed by the surface, irrespective of how that charge is distributed. <p> In its differential form, it states that the divergence of the electric field is proportional to the local density of charge. <!--SR:!2026-07-28,419,382!2026-01-09,254,362-->
  - Gauss's law / mathematical theorem ::@:: an application of the divergence theorem <!--SR:!2026-09-29,460,382!2026-09-18,449,382-->
  - Gauss's law / interpretation ::@:: For the integral form: Consider a volume. The (net) flux out of its surface is only affected by the charge enclosed in the volume. Any charges outside the volume does not change the (net) flux, since for an outside charge, any flux entering the volume is canceled by the same amount of flux exiting the volume. <p> However, this does _not_ mean the flux on the surface is solely determined by the charge enclosed by the volume. Charge outside can modify the flux, it is just that the (net) flux out of the surface does not change. <p> For the derivative form: Charge causes divergence in the electric field. <!--SR:!2026-08-09,429,382!2026-09-13,444,382-->
  - Gauss's law / integral form ::@:: $$\oiint_S \! \mathbf E \cdot \mathrm d \mathbf A = \frac {Q_{\text{enc} } } {\varepsilon_0} \,,$$ where $Q_{\text{enc} }$ is the _total_ (including both _free_ and _bound_) charge in the volume enclosed by the surface $S$. <!--SR:!2026-01-20,265,362!2026-09-11,442,382-->
  - Gauss's law / differential form ::@:: $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf E = \frac \rho {\varepsilon_0} \,,$$ where $\rho$ is the _total_ (including both _free_ and _bound_) charge _density_. <p> This form may be obtained fro the integral form using the divergence theorem. <!--SR:!2026-08-28,439,382!2026-02-17,286,362-->
    - Gauss's law / differential form / from Coulomb's law ::@:: We can consider the electric field for a continuous charge distribution. Then apply the divergence operator, and make use of the identity: $$\nabla \cdot \left( \frac {\mathbf r} {\lvert \mathbf r \rvert^3} \right) = 4 \pi \delta(\mathbf r)$$ and the "sifting property" of the Dirac delta function. <p> The above identity says that the vector field given by $$\frac {\mathbf r} {\lvert \mathbf r \rvert^3}$$ has zero divergence except for the origin, which has a divergence such that when (volume-)integrated over results in $4\pi$. <!--SR:!2025-10-31,184,342!2025-10-30,183,342-->
- [Gaussian surface](../../../../general/Gaussian%20surface.md) ::@:: It is a closed surface in three-dimensional space through which the flux of a vector field is calculated. <p> They are usually carefully chosen to exploit _symmetries_ of a situation to simplify the calculation of the surface integral. If the Gaussian surface is chosen such that for every point on the surface the component of the electric field along the normal vector is _constant_, then the calculation will not require difficult integration as the constants which arise can be taken out of the integral. <!--SR:!2026-09-10,441,382!2026-08-26,427,382-->
  - Gaussian surface / spherical symmetry ::@:: If we use a sphere surface to calculate the electric field produced by a spherically symmetric charge that is fully enclosed by the surface, we find that the electric field it produces is as-if all charges were at the center. (For more, see shell theorem.) <!--SR:!2026-09-12,443,382!2025-10-11,179,342-->

## week 2 lecture 2

- datetime: 2025-02-12T09:00:00+08:00/2025-02-12T10:20:00+08:00
- topic: electric potential
- [electric potential](../../../../general/electric%20potential.md) ::@:: It is the amount of work/energy needed per unit of electric charge to move the charge from a reference point to a specific point in an electric field. <!--SR:!2026-04-25,314,362!2026-09-09,451,382-->
  - electric potential / definition (electrostatic) ::@:: In an _static_ electric field, we have $$V_{\mathbf {E} }=-\int _{\mathcal {C} }\mathbf {E} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell } }\,.$$ Since the electric field is conservative, by the gradient theorem we have $$\mathbf {E} =-\mathbf {\nabla } V_{\mathbf {E} }\,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-01-10,255,362!2026-09-14,446,382-->
  - electric potential / continuous calculation ::@:: In a _vacuum_ (or if $\rho$ does not exclude the _bound_ charges), $$V_{\mathbf {E} }(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0} } }\int _{R}{\frac {\rho (\mathbf {r} ')}{|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r} '|} }\mathrm {d} ^{3}r'\,,$$ which can be derived by knowing that $\nabla \left(\frac 1 {\lvert \mathbf r \rvert} \right) = -\frac {\hat{\mathbf r} } {\lvert \mathbf r \rvert^2}$. (Notice the similarity to $\left(\frac 1 x \right)' = -\frac 1 {x^2}$.) <!--SR:!2025-08-12,120,322!2025-10-10,176,342-->
  - electric potential / curl ::@:: It is curl-free for a _static_ electric field. So it means the produced electric field by a potential is _conservative_. <p> Consider a closed loop (curve) $L$ in the static electric field and apply Stokes' theorem: $$\oint_L \! \mathbf E \cdot \mathrm d\mathbf l = \iint_S \! (\nabla \times \mathbf E) \cdot \mathrm d\mathbf A \,,$$ where $S$ is an oriented surface with $L$ as its boundary. Since the field is curl-free, the integrand in the right hand side is always 0. So the left hand side is 0. This means after following a closed loop in the electric field, the net work done is 0. <!--SR:!2026-01-09,254,362!2025-10-29,182,342-->
  - electric potential / [Maxwell's equations](../../../../general/Maxwell's%20equations.md) ::@:: For a _static_ electric field (no changing magnetic field), the curl-free nature of the field gives us the 2nd equation: $$\nabla \times \mathbf E = \mathbf 0 \,.$$ <p> (With a changing magnetic field, an additional term is needed.) <!--SR:!2026-09-17,448,382!2026-09-10,452,382-->
  - electric potential / reference point ::@:: We can set any arbitrary point as the point where the electric potential is 0. Another common point to use as a reference is the point at infinity. <!--SR:!2026-08-31,442,382!2026-09-17,459,382-->
  - electric potential / finding electric field ::@:: We can use the gradient to find the electric field. Use symmetry if needed to simplify the calculation. <!--SR:!2026-08-31,432,382!2026-04-02,302,362-->
  - electric potential / [equipotential](../../../../general/equipotential.md) ::@:: We can visualize the electric potential using this. They are basically contour lines of the electric potential. <!--SR:!2026-08-19,430,382!2026-10-03,464,382-->
- [electric field](../../../../general/electric%20field.md)
  - electric field / near a surface ::@:: Consider a surface in _vacuum_ with surface charge density $\rho$. We consider the _difference_ of the electric field _just_ above and below the surface. <p> First, consider the difference's normal component. Using a Gaussian pillow box (a rectangle box) and shrinking one of its side such that the box approaches the surface, we can apply Gauss's law and find that the difference's normal component has a magnitude of $\frac {\rho} {\varepsilon_0}$. This means a discontinuity in the electric field crossing the surface. <p> Next, consider the difference's tangential component. Using a loop and shrinking one of its side such that the loop approaches a line on the surface, apply that the electric field is conservative and find that the difference's tangential component has 0 magnitude. This means continuity in the electric field moving along the surface. <!--SR:!2026-05-19,355,377!2025-10-04,173,357-->
    - electric field / near a surface / implications ::@:: Consider an ideal electric conductor with zero electric resistance in a _vacuum_. Any electrostatic field inside the conductor would arrange the charges inside to cancel out the electric field. Thus the electric field inside is 0. So if the conductor has any overall net charge, it must reside on the surface. <p> This is exactly the situation we have described above. We also have that the electric field outside infinitely close to the surface is ${\frac {\sigma }{\varepsilon _{0} } }{\hat {\mathbf {n} } }$, where $\hat {\mathbf n}$ is the outward normal, by the _difference_ of the electric field we have just calculated above. <!--SR:!2026-10-16,477,397!2025-11-24,208,357-->
- electric potential
  - electric potential / near a surface ::@:: Consider a surface with surface charge density $\rho$. We consider the _difference_ of the electric potential _just_ above and below the surface. <p> We simply notice that the path length approaches zero and the electric field magnitude is not unbounded (infinite), so as the distance approaches 0, the potential difference approaches 0. <!--SR:!2026-11-08,501,397!2026-05-01,337,377-->

  - line integral / single-variable calculus ::@:: The single-variable calculus you have been doing has always been a line integral! It is just that the space is 1D, i.e. the real number line, and obviously, the only curves in a 1D space are straight lines. <!--SR:!2026-10-16,477,397!2026-10-14,476,397-->
- [surface integral](../../../../general/surface%20integral.md) ::@:: A generalization of multiple integrals to integration over surfaces. It can be thought of as the double integral analogue of the line integral. <!--SR:!2026-11-21,513,397!2026-05-02,338,377-->

- datetime: 2025-02-17T09:00:00+08:00/2025-02-17T10:20:00+08:00
- topic: electric potential energy
- experiment: fluorescent tube ::@:: Bring a fluorescent tube near the surface of a van der Graff generator. The tube lights up, as the distance to the sphere of the van der Graff generator decreases. <!--SR:!2026-11-07,499,397!2026-04-03,309,377-->
  - experiment: fluorescent tube / interpretation ::@:: Strong electric fields created by the van der Garff generator causes arc discharges in the tube. Atoms becomes a plasma of positively charged ions and electrons. They gain kinetic energy due to Coulomb forces. This energy is transferred to mercury atoms via inelastic collisions. Mercury atoms emit this energy away via radiation. <!--SR:!2026-03-26,301,377!2026-05-04,340,377-->
- [work](../../../../general/work%20(physics).md)
  - work / line integral ::@:: If the force is variable, then work is given by the [line integral](../../../../general/line%20integral.md): $$W=\int {\vec {F} }\cdot d{\vec {s} }$$ where $d{\vec {s} }$ is the tiny change in displacement vector. <!--SR:!2026-11-09,502,397!2026-05-03,339,377-->
- electric potential
  - electric potential / work ::@:: The work of moving a charge $Q$ from $\mathbf a$ to $\mathbf b$ is $$W = Q(V(\mathbf b) - V(\mathbf a)) \,.$$ The negative sign (in the definition of electric potential $\nabla V = -\mathbf E$) is missing from here because adding work to a particle means fighting _against_ the Coulomb force, so two negative signs cancel out. Further, the result is path independent because the Coulomb force is conservative. <p> Note this assumes two things: the charge being moved is assumed to not disturb the field; and the charge is moved with negligible acceleration, so as to avoid the test charge acquiring kinetic energy or producing radiation. <!--SR:!2026-10-14,476,397!2025-10-05,174,357-->
  - electric potential / reference point ::@:: A common reference point $\mathbf a$, where $V(\mathbf a) = 0$ is set, is at infinity. Then we obtain $$W = Q(V(\mathbf r) - V(\infty)) = QV(\mathbf r) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-09-26,457,397!2026-11-06,499,397-->
- [electric potential energy](../../../../general/electric%20potential%20energy.md) ::@:: It is a potential energy (measured in joules) that results from conservative Coulomb forces and is associated with the configuration of a particular set of point charges within a defined system. An object may be said to have \(_this_\) energy by virtue of either its own electric charge or its relative position to other electrically charged objects. <!--SR:!2026-11-07,500,397!2026-11-15,507,397-->
  - electric potential energy / point charges ::@:: In a _vacuum_ (or if _bound_ charges are considered), $$U_E = \frac 1 2 \sum_{i = 1}^n q_i V_i(\mathbf r_i) \,,$$ for $n$ charges, each of charge $q_i$ at position $\mathbf r_i$, and $V_i$ is the electrostatic potential due to all point charges except the one at $\mathbf r_i$. <!--SR:!2026-10-15,476,397!2026-10-04,466,397-->
    - electric potential energy / point charges / derivation ::@:: Consider bringing the $n$ charges from infinity to $\mathbf r_i$ one-by-one, in a _vacuum_ (or if _bound_ charges are also considered). <p> The 1st charge takes no work. The 2nd charge takes some work due to the 1st charge. The 3rd charge takes some work due to the 1st charge and 2nd charge. So we can see the $i$-th charge take work that is proportional to the sum of 1 to $i - 1$-th charges. This forms a triangular sum when visualized in a $n \times n$ 2D grid. Double each term to get a square sum, where the diagonals are 0 (self-interactions take no work). So we have $$U_E = \frac 1 2 \frac 1 {4\pi \varepsilon_0} \sum_{\substack{1 \le i,j \le n \\ i \ne j} } \frac {q_i q_j} {\lvert \mathbf r_i - \mathbf r_j \rvert} = \frac 1 2 \frac 1 {4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \sum_{i = 1}^n q_i \sum_{\substack{j = 1 \\ i \ne j} }^n \frac {q_j} {\lvert \mathbf r_i - \mathbf r_j \rvert} = \frac 1 2 \sum_{i = 1}^n q_i V_i(\mathbf r_i) \,,$$ where $V_i$ is the electrostatic potential due to all point charges except the one at $\mathbf r_i$. <!--SR:!2025-10-02,155,337!2025-08-10,124,337-->
  - electric potential energy / continuous charge ::@:: The energy density, or energy per unit volume, ${\frac {dU}{dV} }$, of the [electrostatic field](../../../../general/electrostatic%20field.md#electrostatic%20fields) of a continuous charge distribution is \(works even with _bounded_ charges\): $$u_{e}={\frac {dU}{dV} }={\frac {1}{2} }\varepsilon _{0}\left|{\mathbf {E} }\right|^{2} \,.$$ To get the configuration energy for the whole continuous charge, integrate the above over the entire space. <p> An alternative way, if the _total_ (including _free_ and _bound_) charge density $\rho$ and potential $V$ are known beforehand, is $$U_E = \frac 1 2 \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! \rho(\mathbf r) V(\mathbf r) \,\mathrm dV \,.$$ (Of course, you can restrict the integration domain to where $\rho$ is nonzero.) <!--SR:!2025-08-23,131,337!2025-07-11,94,317-->
    - electric potential energy / continuous charge / derivation ::@:: A similar argument to that for point charges but with infinitesimal charges would yield: $$U_E = \frac 1 2 \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! \rho(\mathbf r) V(\mathbf r) \,\mathrm dV \,.$$ Manipulate it using vector calculus: $$\begin{aligned} U_E & = \frac 1 2 \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! \rho(\mathbf r) V(\mathbf r) \,\mathrm dV \\ & = \frac {\varepsilon_0} 2 \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf E) \,\mathrm{d}V \\ & = \frac {\varepsilon_0} 2 \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! (\nabla \cdot (V \mathbf E) - \mathbf E \cdot (\nabla V)) \,\mathrm dV \\ & = \frac {\varepsilon_0} 2 \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! \lvert \mathbf E \rvert^2 \,\mathrm dV \,. \end{aligned}$$ The last equality uses the divergence theorem: $$\left\lvert \iiint\limits_{\text{all space} } \! \nabla \cdot (V \mathbf E) \,\mathrm dV \right\rvert = \left\lvert \oiint_{\text{boundary} } \! V \mathbf E \cdot \mathrm d\mathbf A \right\rvert \le \max_{\text{boundary} } \lvert V \rvert \left\lvert \oiint_{\text{boundary} } \! \mathbf E \cdot \mathrm d\mathbf A \right\rvert = 0 \,.$$ The last equality is because $V \to 0$ as $r \to \infty$ (expanding the boundary to cover all space) but the integral is bounded ($\frac {Q_{\text{enc} } } {\varepsilon_0}$ by Gauss's law). <p> Finally, for the above integral to hold for all space, the integrand must equal $\frac {\mathrm dU_E} {\mathrm dV}$. <!--SR:!2025-07-15,98,317!2025-07-15,98,317-->
  - electric potential energy / self-energy of point charges ::@:: Note that point charges have infinite self-energy. That is, to assemble a point charge from infinitesimal charges infinitely far away, you need infinite work. This can be found out using the equation for continuous charge to calculate the self-energy of a spherical shell charge of finite radius, and then shrinking it to a point charge. <p> This explains discrepancy between the equations for point charges and continuous charge. For example, trying to apply the continuous charge equation for a lone point charge results does not work well (the electric field is infinite at the point charge), while that using the point charge equation is zero work. We can say that the equation for point charges _excludes_ the self-energy of point charges, because it is meaningless (infinite). <!--SR:!2026-11-08,500,397!2026-05-18,354,377-->

- topic: electric dipoles and multipoles
- [dipole](../../../../general/dipole.md) ::@:: It is the separation of the positive and negative electric charges found in any electromagnetic system. A simple example of this system is a pair of charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign separated by some typically small distance. <!--SR:!2026-06-28,387,389!2026-06-18,379,388-->
  - dipole / electric potential ::@:: Consider two opposite electric charges $+q$ and $-q$ separated by a distance of $2d$. Let their center be the origin. We want to find the electric potential at $\mathbf r$, $V(\mathbf r)$, where $\lvert \mathbf r \rvert \gg d$. <p> We could say $V(\mathbf r) \approx 0$, which is true, but we can get a better approximation. <!--SR:!2025-08-05,128,389!2025-08-06,129,388-->
    - dipole / electric potential / approximation ::@:: We want to find $V(\mathbf r)$ in a _vacuum_. Obviously, $V(\mathbf r) = \frac q {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \left(\frac 1 {\lvert \mathbf r - \mathbf d \rvert} - \frac 1 {\lvert \mathbf r + \mathbf d \rvert} \right)$. But we only want the approximating expression to contain $r, d, \theta$ instead of vectors, where $r = \lvert \mathbf r \rvert$, $d = \lvert \mathbf d \rvert$, and $\theta$ is the angle between the aforementioned two vectors. <p> We can use the cosine law: $$\begin{aligned} V(\mathbf r) & = \frac q {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \left(\frac 1 {\sqrt{r^2 + d^2 - 2rd \cos \theta} } - \frac 1 {\sqrt{r^2 + d^2 + 2rd \cos \theta} } \right) \\ & = \frac q {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac 1 r \left(\frac 1 {\sqrt{1 + (d / r)^2 - 2(d/r) \cos\theta} } - \frac 1 {\sqrt{1 + (d/r)^2 + 2(d/r) \cos\theta} } \right) \,. \end{aligned}$$ However, this looks messy, and we want an expression in terms of some integer power of some variables... <p> Let $\varepsilon_\pm = (d / r) (d / r \pm 2 \cos\theta)$. We can use Taylor series to approximate the square roots: $$\begin{aligned} \frac 1 {\sqrt{1 + \varepsilon_\pm} } & = \binom {-1/2} 0 \varepsilon_\pm^0 + \binom {-1/2} 1 \varepsilon_\pm^1 + \binom {-1/2} 2 \varepsilon_\pm^2 + \cdots \\ & = 1 + \frac {(-1/2)} {1!} \varepsilon_\pm + \frac {(-1/2)(-3/2)} {2!} \varepsilon_\pm^2 + \cdots \\ & = 1 - \frac 1 2 \varepsilon_\pm + \frac 3 8 \varepsilon_\pm^2 + \cdots \,. \end{aligned}$$ Now we consider each tem of the above approximation in the context of $V(\mathbf r)$. Consider the first term $1$. If we truncate the series here, we are basically saying $V(\mathbf r) = 0$, which is approximately correct, but we want a more accurate approximation. Truncating at the second term $-\frac 1 2 \varepsilon_\pm$ suffices, since it produces $-\frac 1 2 \varepsilon_- + \frac 1 2 \varepsilon_+ = \frac 1 2 \frac d r 4 \cos \theta = \frac {2d \cos \theta} r$, a non-zero term. Also, the higher terms $\varepsilon_\pm^2$ and so on do not produce any more terms with $d/r$ having the exponent 1. <p> So finally, we have the better approximation: $$V(\mathbf r) \approx \frac q {4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac {2d \cos \theta} {r^2} \,.$$ It shows that the potential of a dipole is approximately proportional to $1 / r^2$ when $r \gg d$. Now consider what happens if we have more terms...? <!--SR:!2025-08-02,107,329!2025-08-01,106,329-->
    - dipole / electric potential / better approximations ::@:: It turns out the higher terms correspond to quadrupole (a square with alternating charges as its vertices), octopole (a cube with alternating charges as its vertices), and so on. And we can also see that an electric charge is a monopole. <p> There is also a pattern with regards to the electric potential. A monopole has $V \propto 1/r$, a dipole has $V \propto 1 / r^2$, a quadrupole has $V \propto 1 / r^3$, a octopole has $V \propto 1 / r^4$, and so on. <!--SR:!2025-08-06,129,389!2026-06-15,376,388-->
- [axial multipole moments](../../../../general/axial%20multipole%20moments.md) ::@:: It is a series expansion of the electric potential of a charge distribution localized close to the origin along one Cartesian axis. <!--SR:!2025-07-27,120,388!2025-09-11,147,349-->
  - axial multipole moments / point charges ::@:: If we repeat the above dipole approximation derivation in a _vacuum_, but with only 1 charge, we have $$V(\mathbf r) = \frac q {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac 1 r \left(1 - \frac 1 2 \varepsilon + \frac 3 8 \varepsilon^2 + \cdots \right) \,,$$ where $\varepsilon = (d / r) (d / r - 2\cos\theta)$. With some care, we can convert the above expansion from in terms of $\varepsilon$ to $d / r$: $$\begin{aligned} V(\mathbf r) & = \frac q {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac 1 r \left(1 + \left(\frac d r\right) \cos \theta + \left(\frac d r \right)^2 \left(\frac {3 \cos^2 \theta - 1} 2 \right) + \left(\frac d r \right)^3 \left(\frac {5 \cos^3\theta - 3 \cos \theta} 2 + \cdots \right)\right) \\ & = \frac q {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac 1 r \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \left(\frac d r \right)^k P_k(\cos\theta) \,, \end{aligned}$$ where $P_k$ are the _Legendre polynomials_. <p> If we have multiple point charges, simply add the potentials together. The following form is more convenient for a system of _n_ point charges: $$V(\mathbf r) = \frac 1 {4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac 1 {r^{k + 1} } P_k(\cos \theta) \sum_{i = 1}^n q_i d_i^k  \,.$$ It is more convenient because terms that depend only on $\mathbf r$ are separated from terms that depend only on the charge configuration. <p> Note that if the charges are not all at a line (axial, as required by axial multipole moments), then $P_k(\cos \theta)$ also depends on the charge configuration and should be moved inside the integral. <!--SR:!2025-07-28,102,329!2025-11-30,185,349-->
  - axial multipole moments / continuous charge ::@:: The derivation is very similar to above, but using charge density instead. We have, in a _vacuum_ (or if $\rho$ considers _bound_ charges): $$V(\mathbf r) = \frac 1 {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac 1 {r^{k + 1} } P_k(\cos \theta) \int \! \rho(l) l^k \,\mathrm{d}l \,.$$ <p> Note that if the charges are not all at a line (axial, as required by axial multipole moments), then $P_k(\cos \theta)$ also depends on the charge configuration and should be moved inside the integral. The integral would also need to integrate over a volume instead, with $l$ replaced by a vector $\mathbf l$ (and $l^k$ with $\lvert \mathbf l \rvert^k$). <!--SR:!2025-10-24,148,308!2025-09-19,142,328-->
  - axial multipole moments / interpretation ::@:: The first term in the approximation ($k = 0$) is the contribution to $V(\mathbf r)$ by treating the charge as a monopole. The second term is the contribution by treating the charge as a dipole, and so on. <p> We can see in the case of a electric dipole, the monopole term contributes nothing because the entire configuration has zero net charge, which allows the second term to dominate at large $r$. Compare with there being a nonzero net charge in the configuration, where the first term dominates at large $r$. This explains why we truncate up to $(d / r)^2$ to get an approximation for dipoles. <!--SR:!2026-03-09,284,369!2026-06-04,368,388-->
- [electric dipole moment](../../../../general/electric%20dipole%20moment.md) ::@:: It is a measure of the separation of positive and negative electrical charges within a system. <p> Theoretically, an electric dipole is defined by the first-order term of the multipole expansion; it consists of two equal and opposite charges that are infinitesimally close together, although real dipoles have separated charge. <!--SR:!2026-08-08,408,389!2025-07-21,115,389-->
  - electric dipole moment / motivation (approximation) ::@:: We can see that in the approximation of the electric potential of a configuration in a _vacuum_ (or if $\rho$ includes _bound_ charges) using multipole moments, the first term is $$\frac 1 {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac 1 {r^1} \int_V \! P_0(\cos \theta) \rho(\mathbf r') (r')^0 \,\mathrm d^3\mathbf r' = \frac 1 {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac 1 r Q \,,$$ where $Q$ is the net charge, since $P_0(x) = 1$. The second term is $$\begin{aligned} & \phantom = \frac 1 {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac 1 {r^2} \int_V \! P_1(\cos \theta) \rho(\mathbf r')(r')^1 \,\mathrm{d}^3\mathbf r' \\ & = \frac 1 {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac 1 {r^2} \int_V \! r' \cos \theta \rho(\mathbf r') \,\mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf r' \\ & = \frac 1 {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac {\hat {\mathbf r} } {r^2} \cdot \int_V \! \mathbf r' \rho(\mathbf r')\,\mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf r' \,, \end{aligned}$$ since $P_1(x) = x$. <p> The motivation is that it would be nice to define something like $Q$ but for dipoles. We can define it like so: $$\mathbf p(\mathbf r) = \int_V \! (\mathbf r' - \mathbf r) \rho(\mathbf r') \,\mathrm d^3 \mathbf r' \,,$$ where $\mathbf r$ is a reference point. But for an electric dipole, since the net charge is zero, the above expression gives the same vector no matter what $\mathbf r$ is. So we can just remove the argument $\mathbf r$ for electric dipoles. <!--SR:!2025-09-12,148,348!2025-07-29,103,329-->
  - electric dipole moment / definition ::@:: We can define it like so: $$\mathbf p(\mathbf r) = \int_V \! (\mathbf r' - \mathbf r) \rho(\mathbf r') \,\mathrm d^3 \mathbf r' \,,$$ where $\mathbf r$ is a reference point. (Whether $\rho$ includes _bound_ charges depends on the calculation context.) <p> For an electric dipole, the argument $\mathbf r$ can be dropped, since it makes no difference. <p> For point charges: $$\mathbf p(\mathbf r) = \sum_{k = 1}^n (\mathbf r'_k - \mathbf r) q_k\,.$$ When the point charges are neutral overall, the argument $\mathbf r$ can be dropped. For an electric dipole consisting of two point charges: $$\mathbf p = q\mathbf d \,,$$ where $\mathbf d$ is the vector from the negative charge to the positive charge. <!--SR:!2026-02-12,259,369!2025-11-27,211,368-->
  - electric dipole moment / electric potential ::@:: The electric potential due to an _idealized_ electric dipole in a _vacuum_: $$V(\mathbf r) = \frac 1 {4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac {\mathbf p \cdot \hat {\mathbf r} } {r^2} \,.$$ For electric dipoles with separation $d$, the above is _only_ an approximation that is accurate when $d \ll r$. <!--SR:!2025-11-25,180,348!2026-06-14,375,388-->
  - electric dipole moment / direction ::@:: It is directed from negative to positive. <!--SR:!2025-07-28,121,389!2025-07-22,116,389-->
  - electric dipole moment / to electric field ::@:: Assume we have an _idealized_ electric dipole with moment $\mathbf p$ in a _vacuum_. Find the gradient of its potential: $$\begin{aligned} \mathbf E(\mathbf r) & = -\nabla V(\mathbf r) \\ & = -\nabla\left( \frac 1 {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac 1 {r^2} \mathbf p \cdot \hat{\mathbf r} \right) \\ & = -\nabla\left( \frac 1 {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac {p \cos \theta} {r^2} \right) \,. \end{aligned}$$ However, if we do the derivation in terms of Euclidean coordinates, it would be too complicated. Let's do it in terms of spherical coordinates, with $\mathbf r$ being the radial unit vector and $\mathbf p$ pointing upwards (so $\theta$ is the polar angle). Note that we need to be careful when taking the gradient \(very cursed\): $$\begin{aligned} E_r & = -\frac {\partial V} {\partial r} = \frac 1 {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac {2 p \cos \theta} {r^3} \\ E_\theta & = - \frac 1 r \frac {\partial V} {\partial \theta} = \frac 1 {4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac {p \sin \theta} {r^3} \\ E_\varphi & = - \frac 1 {r \sin\theta} \frac {\partial V} {\partial \varphi} = 0 \,. \end{aligned}$$ Combining: $$\mathbf E(r, \theta, \varphi) = \frac p {4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r^3} (2 \cos\theta \hat {\mathbf r} + \sin\theta \hat {\boldsymbol \theta}) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-30,104,329!2025-12-12,197,349-->

- topic: Dirac delta function, Taylor expansion
- [Dirac delta function](../../../../general/Dirac%20delta%20function.md) ::@:: It is _generalized function_ (which is not a _function_) that is zero everywhere except at zero, and its "value" (it is not a _value_ in the sense of a _function_) at zero is infinite such that the integral over the entire real number line is 1. <p> It makes less sense to think of it as a function by itself, and more sense to think of it as an _action_ on another function inside an integral. <!--SR:!2025-08-11,125,393!2025-08-09,123,393-->
  - Dirac delta function / motivation ::@:: How do we represent a point charge as charge density? Such a point charge must have infinite charge density since the charge is nonzero but volume is zero. <p> Dirac delta function can be used to represent such point charges. <!--SR:!2025-08-13,127,393!2025-08-01,119,393-->
  - Dirac delta function / sifting property ::@:: $$\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(t)\,\delta (t-T)\,dt=f(T) \,.$$ The delta function is said to "sift out" the value of _f\(t\)_ at _t_ = _T_. <p> (there are some conditions of $f$ that we will ignore here) <!--SR:!2025-07-30,117,393!2025-07-30,117,393-->
  - Dirac delta function / multiple dimension ::@:: Multiply the 1-dimensional Dirac delta functions multiple times. Each "sifts out" the value of _f_ of a coordinate (noting that a point in multiple dimensions is represented by multiple coordinates) at a fixed value. <p> In that case, all coordinates of a point must match for the value of _f_ to be "sifted out" in the integrand of an integral. Otherwise the integrand is 0 (since at least one Dirac delta function does not "sift out" the value of _f_). <!--SR:!2025-08-13,127,393!2025-07-28,115,393-->
  - Dirac delta function / boundary ::@:: If the Dirac delta function is on the integration boundary, there is no unique way to define the integration result. <p> One way \(used in this course\) is to consider the limit of integration of a sequence of normal distributions approaching the Dirac delta function. In the one-dimensional case, this means the result is 1/2. <!--SR:!2025-08-29,113,413!2025-11-03,158,433-->
- [Taylor series](../../../../general/Taylor%20series.md) ::@:: It of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at a single point. <!--SR:!2025-08-08,122,393!2025-08-02,120,393-->
  - Taylor series / motivation ::@:: We want to approximate a function near a point by a simpler function, and also want to know estimate the approximation error. <!--SR:!2025-08-08,122,393!2025-08-11,125,393-->
  - Taylor series / expression ::@:: Given a a [real](../../../../general/real-valued%20function.md) or [complex-valued function](../../../../general/complex-valued%20function.md) _f_<!-- markdown separator --> \(_x_\), that is [infinitely differentiable](../../../../general/infinitely%20differentiable%20function.md) at a [real](../../../../general/real%20number.md) or [complex number](../../../../general/complex%20number.md) _a_, it is $$f(a)+{\frac {f'(a)}{1!} }(x-a)+{\frac {f''(a)}{2!} }(x-a)^{2}+\cdots =\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} }(x-a)^{n}.$$ Here, _n_! denotes the [factorial](../../../../general/factorial.md) of _n_. The function _f_<sup>\(_n_\)</sup>\(_a_\) denotes the _n_-th [derivative](../../../../general/derivative.md) of _f_ evaluated at the point _a_. The derivative of order zero of _f_ is defined to be _f_ itself and \(_x_ − _a_\)<sup>0</sup> and 0! [are both defined to be 1](../../../../general/empty%20product.md). <p> _a_ is usually chosen to be 0. <!--SR:!2025-08-11,125,393!2025-07-29,116,393-->
  - Taylor series / conditions ::@:: Apart from being infinitely differentiable, the infinite series should also converge. The input values for which the series converge is the _region of convergence_. <p> Also, even if the series converges, it may not converge to the actual function value. <!--SR:!2025-08-03,121,393!2025-08-15,129,393-->
  - Taylor series / approximation ::@:: To approximate a function near a point, assuming the series converges, we truncate the series to a certain number of terms. The approximation is more accurate for inputs closer to _a_. <!--SR:!2025-07-28,115,393!2025-08-07,121,393-->
    - Taylor series / approximation / error ::@:: We use the _Lagrange form_ of Taylor's theorem. Assume we truncate the terms up to $x^k$ \(the $x^k$ term is included\). <p> Let _f_ : __R__ → __R__ be _k_ + 1 times [differentiable](../../../../general/differentiable%20function.md) on the [open interval](../../../../general/open%20interval.md#open%20interval) with _f_<sup>\(_k_\)</sup> [continuous](../../../../general/continuous%20function.md) on the [closed interval](../../../../general/closed%20interval.md#definitions%20and%20terminology) between $a$ and $x$. Then $$R_{k}(x)={\frac {f^{(k+1)}(\xi _{L})}{(k+1)!} }(x-a)^{k+1}$$ for some real number $\xi _{L}$ between $a$ and $x$. <p> We can thus find the maximum error by finding the _absolute_ maximum value of the above function in its domain. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,89,333!2025-07-13,90,333-->

- topic: physics of capacitors
- [electrical conductor](../../../../general/electrical%20conductor.md) ::@:: an object or type of material that allows the flow of charge (electric current) in one or more directions <!--SR:!2025-08-08,122,393!2025-07-31,118,393-->
  - electrical conductor / ideal ::@::  Consider an ideal electric conductor with zero electric resistance in a _vacuum_. Any electrostatic field inside the conductor would arrange the charges inside to cancel out the electric field. Thus the electric field inside is 0, and so is its electric charge density by Gauss's law. This means the whole conductor is an equipotential. <p> If the conductor has any overall net charge, it must reside on the surface to minimize its energy configuration. <p> We also have that the electric field outside infinitely close to the surface is perpendicular. More precisely, it is ${\frac {\sigma }{\varepsilon _{0} } }{\hat {\mathbf {n} } }$, where $\hat {\mathbf n}$ is the outward normal, by the _difference_ of the electric field we have just calculated some time ago. <!--SR:!2025-07-04,94,373!2026-02-11,258,373-->
- [electrostatic induction](../../../../general/electrostatic%20induction.md) ::@:: It is a redistribution of electric charge in an object that is caused by the influence of nearby charges. In the presence of a charged body, an insulated conductor develops a positive charge on one end and a negative charge on the other end. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,90,373!2025-08-09,123,393-->
  - electrostatic induction / charge in a cavity ::@:: If we put a point charge $q$ inside a cavity of conductor, induction makes it appear as if the conductor has the charge $q$ viewed from the outside. <p> This can be derived from using Gauss's law. Intuitively, it is explained by charges on the cavity surface canceling the point charge $q$, while their corresponding opposite charges move to the outside surface to exhibit a charge of $q$. <!--SR:!2025-08-07,121,393!2025-08-12,126,393-->
- [capacitor](../../../../general/capacitor.md) ::@:: a device that stores electrical energy by accumulating electric charges on two closely spaced surfaces that are insulated from each other <!--SR:!2025-08-09,123,393!2025-08-01,119,393-->
  - capacitor / description ::@:: Consider  two ideal conductors, one of charge $Q_1$, the other of charge $Q_2$. Since the potential in an ideal conductor is constant, we can speak of their _potential difference_: $$V = V_+ - V_- = -\int_{(-)}^{(+)} \! \mathbf E \cdot \mathrm d\mathbf l \,.$$ We do not know what the exact charge distribution is, but by Coulomb's law, it should be proportional be the charges on the conductors. The proportionality constant is known as the _capacitance_: $$C \equiv \frac {Q_1 - Q_2} {2V} \,,$$ which has the special case for $Q \equiv Q_1 = -Q_2$: $$C = \frac Q V \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-08-14,128,393!2025-07-02,89,373-->
- [capacitance](../../../../general/capacitance.md) ::@:: the ability of an object to store electric charge <!--SR:!2025-08-03,121,393!2025-07-28,115,393-->
  - capacitance / self-capacitance ::@:: It is defined by the ratio of charge and electric potential: $$C={\frac {q}{V} } \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-08-17,131,393!2025-08-14,128,393-->
  - capacitance / mutual capacitance ::@:: If the charges on the plates are $+q$ and $-q$, and $V$ gives the [voltage](voltage.md) between the plates, then the capacitance $C$ is given by $$C={\frac {q}{V} } \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-31,118,393!2025-07-29,116,393-->
  - capacitance / unit ::@:: farad, coulomb-per-volt; F = A<sup>2</sup> s<sup>4</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−2</sup> <!--SR:!2025-07-02,89,373!2025-06-28,85,373-->
  - capacitance / parallel plate capacitor ::@:: Consider two ideal conductors of the same area $A$, one of charge $+Q$, the other of charge $-Q$, separated by a distance of $d$. The charge density is $\rho = \frac Q A$. From above, we know that the electric field magnitude created infinitely close to the surface is $\frac \rho \varepsilon$. If $A \gg d$, then the electric field between the plates are approximately uniform. Thus the potential difference between them is about $\frac {\rho d} {\varepsilon}$, and capacitance is: $$C = \frac {Q} {\frac {\rho d} {\varepsilon}} = \frac {Q \varepsilon} {\rho d} = \frac {A \varepsilon} d \,,$$ where $\varepsilon$ is the electric permittivity of the intervening medium ($\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0$ for a vacuum). <!--SR:!2025-07-13,96,373!2025-08-16,130,393-->
- capacitor
  - capacitor / discharge ::@:: Electric potential energy can be stored inside a capacitor. This energy represents bringing the charges from infinity to the plates. <p> To see this, maintain a potential difference between two parallel plates. Then stop maintaining the difference while shorting the two plates with a lamp. The lamp should light up for a short time. This shows electric current can release this energy. <p> The larger the capacitance, the more energy can be stored (per potential difference). <!--SR:!2026-04-28,334,393!2025-08-15,129,393-->
  - capacitor / energy storage ::@:: Consider two neutral parallel plate. We move infinitesimal charges from one plate to the other so that one plate has $+Q$ while the other plate has $-Q$. Moving an infinitesimal against a potential difference of $V \,\mathrm dq = q / C \,\mathrm dq$, where $q$ is the charge moved so far. Then simply integrate it: $$W = \int_0^Q \! \frac q C \,\mathrm dq = \frac 1 2 \frac {Q^2} C = \frac 1 2 Q V = \frac 1 2 CV^2 \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-29,116,393!2025-08-09,123,393-->
    - capacitor / energy storage ::@:: We can also consider the energy stored in the electric field between the two plates of area $A$ and distance $d$. Assuming edge effects are negligible (i.e. $A \gg d$). Then the electric field is approximately uniform and has a magnitude of about $\frac \rho {\varepsilon}$. Calculate: $$W = Ad \frac \varepsilon 2 \left\lvert \frac \rho {\varepsilon} \right\rvert^2 = \frac {Ad \rho^2} {2 \varepsilon} = \frac {Q^2 d} {2 A \varepsilon} = \frac 1 2 \frac {Q^2} C = \frac 1 2 Q V = \frac 1 2 C V^2\,,$$ where $\varepsilon$ is the electric permittivity of the intervening medium ($\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0$ for a vacuum). <!--SR:!2026-05-27,335,373!2025-06-30,87,373-->
- capacitor
  - capacitor / capacitors in parallel ::@:: Using the schematic diagram to visualize parallel plates, it is apparent that each capacitor contributes to the total surface area. <!--SR:!2025-08-15,129,393!2025-08-03,121,393-->
    - capacitor / capacitors in parallel / voltage ::@:: Capacitors in a parallel configuration each have the same applied voltage. <!--SR:!2025-08-07,121,393!2025-08-02,120,393-->
    - capacitor / capacitors in parallel / capacitance ::@:: Their capacitance values add up. Charge is apportioned among them by capacitance value. $$C_{\mathrm {eq} }=\sum _{i=1}^{n}C_{i}=C_{1}+C_{2}+\cdots +C_{n}$$ <!--SR:!2025-08-09,123,393!2025-08-06,120,393-->
  - capacitor / capacitors in series ::@:: Connected in series, the schematic diagram reveals that the separation distance, not the plate area, adds up. <!--SR:!2025-08-08,122,393!2025-08-02,120,393-->
    - capacitor / capacitors in series / voltage ::@:: The total voltage difference from end to end is apportioned to each capacitor according to the inverse of its capacitance. <!--SR:!2025-08-06,120,393!2025-08-01,119,393-->
    - capacitor / capacitors in series / capacitance ::@:: The capacitors each store instantaneous charge build-up equal to that of every other capacitor in the series (in order to maintain charge neutrality of the wires connecting the capacitors). The entire series acts as a capacitor smaller than any of its components. $$C_{\mathrm {eq} }=\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {1}{C_{i} } }\right)^{-1}=\left({1 \over C_{1} }+{1 \over C_{2} }+{1 \over C_{3} }+\dots +{1 \over C_{n} }\right)^{-1}$$ <!--SR:!2025-08-03,121,393!2025-08-10,124,393-->

- topic: physics of dielectrics
- [dielectric](../../../../general/dielectric.md) ::@:: an electrical insulator that can be polarized by an applied electric field <!--SR:!2025-07-29,116,393!2025-08-06,120,393-->
  - dielectric / polarization ::@:: When a dielectric material is placed in an electric field, electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an electrical conductor, because they have no loosely bound, or free, electrons that may drift through the material, but instead they shift, only slightly, from their average equilibrium positions, causing _dielectric polarization_. <!--SR:!2025-08-12,126,393!2025-08-05,123,393-->
    - dielectric / polarization / effects ::@:: Because of dielectric polarization, positive charges are displaced in the direction of the field and negative charges shift in the direction opposite to the field. This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself. If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules, those molecules not only become polarized, but also reorient so that their symmetry axes align to the field. <!--SR:!2025-08-10,124,393!2025-08-03,121,393-->
  - dielectric / electric susceptibility ::@:: It is defined as the constant of proportionality \(which may be a [tensor](../../../../general/tensor.md)\) relating an electric field $\mathbf {E}$ to the induced dielectric polarization density $\mathbf {P}$ such that $$\mathbf {P} =\varepsilon _{0}\chi _{e}\mathbf {E} ,$$ where $\varepsilon _{0}$ is the [electric permittivity of free space](../../../../general/vacuum%20permittivity.md). <!--SR:!2025-08-14,128,393!2025-08-16,130,393-->
  - dielectric / relative permittivity ::@:: The susceptibility of a medium is related to its relative permittivity $\varepsilon _{r}$ by $$\chi _{e}\ =\varepsilon _{r}-1.$$ So in the case of a [classical vacuum](../../../../general/vacuum.md#electromagnetism), $$\chi _{e}\ =0.$$ <p> The [electric displacement](../../../../general/electric%20displacement.md) $\mathbf {D}$ is related to the polarisation density $\mathbf {P}$ by $$\mathbf {D} \ =\ \varepsilon _{0}\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {P} \ =\ \varepsilon _{0}\left(1+\chi _{e}\right)\mathbf {E} \ =\ \varepsilon _{0}\varepsilon _{r}\mathbf {E} .$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-02,89,373!2025-10-20,173,353-->
  - dielectric / applications
    - dielectric / applications / capacitors ::@:: Using dielectric with high permittivity as the intervening medium between the stored positive and negative charges allows a greater stored charge at a given voltage, i.e. capacitance is increased: $$C = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r \frac A D = \varepsilon \frac A D \,,$$ where $\varepsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $\varepsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity of the dielectric, and $\varepsilon$ is the (absolute) permittivity of the dielectric. <!--SR:!2025-08-14,128,393!2025-08-06,120,393-->
- electric field
  - electric field / electric displacement field ::@:: In the presence of matter, it is helpful to extend the notion of the electric field into three vector fields: $$\mathbf {D} =\varepsilon _{0}\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {P}$$ where __P__ is the [electric polarization](../../../../general/electric%20polarization.md) – the volume density of [electric dipole moments](../../../../general/electric%20dipole%20moment.md), and __D__ is the [electric displacement field](../../../../general/electric%20displacement%20field.md). Since __E__ and __P__ are defined separately, this equation can be used to define __D__. The physical interpretation of __D__ is not as clear as __E__ \(effectively the field applied to the material\) or __P__ \(induced field due to the dipoles in the material\), but still serves as a convenient mathematical simplification, since Maxwell's equations can be simplified in terms of [free charges and currents](../../../../general/Maxwell's%20equations.md#macroscopic%20formulation). <!--SR:!2025-08-13,127,393!2026-02-12,242,353-->
- [electric displacement field](../../../../general/electric%20displacement%20field.md) ::@:: It is a vector field that appears in Maxwell's equations. It accounts for the electromagnetic effects of polarization and that of an electric field, combining the two in an auxiliary field. <!--SR:!2025-08-02,120,393!2025-07-28,115,393-->
  - electric displacement field / intuition ::@:: Consider a vacuum. Apply an electric field by a free charge density field. Then $\mathbf D = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf E$, and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf D = \rho = \rho_{\text{free} }$. The divergence of the electric displacement field is the free charge density field. <p> Then consider a dielectric. Then $\mathbf D = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf E + \mathbf P$. Assuming the same applied electric field, compare with above. $\mathbf E$ is reduced since the dielectric is polarized. So we add up the polarization field to compensate for it, so that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf D = \rho - \rho_{\text{bound} } = \rho_{\text{free} }$ again says the divergence of the electric displacement field is the free charge density field. This is done by subtracting the opposing bound charge density field. <!--SR:!2025-08-01,119,393!2025-07-10,93,373-->
  - electric displacement field / thinking ::@:: Strictly speaking, bound charges are fundamentally the same as free charges. So Maxwell's laws work even if there are bound charges, as long as you know all the bound charges. <p> In practice, it is easier to treat bound charges separately from free charges. The electric displacement field reflects this. \(Absolute\) permittivity of a material is intuitively understood by treating the bound charges as part of the "vacuum" and considering only free charges in this "vacuum". <!--SR:!2025-09-01,140,407!2025-07-17,97,388-->
- phenomenological average ::@:: Essentially just the macroscopic average over space and time: $$\overline{f(\mathbf r, t)} = \frac 1 {\lvert V(\mathbf r) \rvert T(t)} \int_{V(\mathbf r) \times T} \! f(\mathbf r', t') \,\mathrm d^3 \mathbf r' \,\mathrm dt' \,,$$ where $V(\mathbf r)$ is an infinitesimal (microscopically large, macroscopically small) volume and $T$ is an infinitesimal time slice. (Very bad abuse of notation here... But the original lecture notes were much more worse...) <!--SR:!2025-07-28,115,393!2025-07-31,118,393-->
  - phenomenological average / usage ::@:: Using it, we can statistically turn microscopic behaviors of many particles into macroscopic behaviors of an area. <p> Assuming macroscopic behaviors dominates microscopic behaviors, this average commutates with $\nabla$, $\nabla \cdot$, and $\nabla \times$. <!--SR:!2025-08-03,121,393!2025-08-08,122,393-->
- electric displacement field
  - electric displacement field / derivation ::@:: We consider the microscopic behaviors of many atoms under an applied electric field. Find the resulting potential field. <p> First, we write the resulting potential field using multipole expansion up to the 1st order (dipole term), integrating over the entire space. Then apply phenomenological average (apply another integral on top of the existing integral) to turn the microscopic behaviors into macroscopic behaviors. Finally, one should get an equation containing macroscopic charge density $\rho = \overline{\rho_e}$ and macroscopic polarization $\mathbf P = \overline{\mathbf \Pi_e}$. Apply the Laplace operator to derive the electric field and then the electric displacement field. <!--SR:!2025-07-01,88,373!2025-07-10,93,373-->
  - electric displacement field / Gauss's law ::@:: The displacement field satisfies [Gauss's law](../../../../general/Gauss's%20law.md) in a dielectric: $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf {D} =\rho -\rho _{\text{b} }=\rho _{\text{f} }$$ <p> In this equation, $\rho _{\text{f} }$ is the number of free charges per unit volume. <!--SR:!2025-08-01,119,393!2025-08-15,129,393-->
    - electric displacement field / Gauss's law / interpretation ::@:: These free charges are the ones that have made the volume non-neutral, and they are sometimes referred to as the [space charge](../../../../general/space%20charge.md). This equation says, in effect, that the flux lines of __D__ must begin and end on the free charges. In contrast $\rho _{\text{b} }$, which is called the bound charge, is an effective density of the charges that are part of a [dipole](../../../../general/dipole.md). <!--SR:!2025-08-13,127,393!2025-08-11,125,393-->
  - electric displacement field / curl ::@:: __D__ is not determined exclusively by the free charge. As __E__ has a curl of zero in electrostatic situations, it follows that $$\nabla \times \mathbf {D} =\nabla \times \mathbf {P}$$ <!--SR:!2025-08-14,128,393!2025-08-02,120,393-->
    - electric displacement field / curl / interpretation ::@:: The effect of this equation can be seen in the case of an object with a "frozen in" polarization like a bar [electret](electret.md), the electric analogue to a bar magnet. There is no free charge in such a material, but the inherent polarization gives rise to an electric field, demonstrating that the __D__ field is not determined entirely by the free charge. <!--SR:!2025-06-29,86,373!2025-07-13,96,373-->
- [polarization density](../../../../general/polarization%20density.md) ::@:: It is the vector field that expresses the volumetric density of permanent or induced electric dipole moments in a dielectric material. When a dielectric is placed in an external electric field, its molecules gain electric dipole moment and the dielectric is said to be polarized. <!--SR:!2025-08-11,125,393!2025-08-12,126,393-->
  - polarization density / definition ::@:: The polarization density __P__ of a dielectric inside an infinitesimal volume d<!-- markdown separator -->_V_ with an infinitesimal dipole moment d<!-- markdown separator -->__p__ is: $$\mathbf {P} ={\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p} }{\mathrm {d} V} }$$ The net charge appearing as a result of polarization is called bound charge and denoted $Q_{b}$. <!--SR:!2025-08-07,121,393!2026-05-24,332,373-->
  - polarization density / integral form ::@:: For a given volume _V_ enclosed by a surface _S_, the bound charge $Q_{b}$ inside it is equal to the flux of __P__ through _S_ taken with the negative sign, or $$-Q_{b}= \oiint_S \mathbf {P} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {A}$$ <!--SR:!2025-08-12,126,393!2026-03-22,280,393-->
  - polarization density / source of bound charges ::@:: If the surface warps the entire object in a _vacuum_, then the _net_ bound charge included in the volume must vanish, since both the negative and positive induced charges are included. <p> This also implies that _bound_ dipoles that are not balanced by their other poles can only be found at the Gaussian surface, since the other poles can be located outside the volume. Those inside must have both poles included in the volume. <!--SR:!2025-08-03,121,393!2025-07-31,118,393-->
  - polarization density / differential form ::@:: By the divergence theorem, Gauss's law for the field __P__ can be stated in _differential form_ as: $$-\rho _{b}=\nabla \cdot \mathbf {P} ,$$ where ∇ · __P__ is the divergence of the field __P__ through a given surface containing the bound charge density $\rho _{b}$. <!--SR:!2025-08-10,124,393!2025-08-11,125,393-->
  - polarization density / sources ::@:: 3 main types: dielectric, paraelectric, ferroelectric <!--SR:!2025-08-16,130,393!2025-07-30,117,393-->
  - polarization density / dielectric ::@:: The applied electric field shifts the positive and negative charges bound in a neutral atom relatively to each other so that electric dipoles are created. This is _deformation polarization_. <!--SR:!2025-08-12,126,393!2025-08-10,124,393-->
  - polarization density / paraelectric ::@:: The material contains permanent dipoles. Without an applied electric field, they are randomly oriented, cancelling out each other. With an applied electric field, they align to decrease potential energy of the system. This is _orientation polarization_. <p> This ordering tendency is opposed by the disordering tendency from thermal motion, leading to temperature-dependent responses. <!--SR:!2025-08-06,120,393!2025-07-09,92,373-->
  - polarization density / ferroelectric ::@:: The material contains permanent dipoles. Further, they orient themselves spontaneously (below a critical temperature). Without an applied electric field, they themselves produce a electric field. With an applied field, they exhibit field-dependant complicated behaviors (and will not be considered for now). <!--SR:!2025-07-10,93,373!2025-07-30,117,393-->

- topic: integral theorems
- [gradient theorem](../../../../general/gradient%20theorem.md) ::@:: It says that a [line integral](../../../../general/line%20integral.md) through a [gradient field](../../../../general/conservative%20vector%20field.md) can be evaluated by evaluating the original scalar field at the endpoints of the curve. <!--SR:!2025-09-02,141,407!2025-08-17,129,408-->
  - gradient theorem / mathematical statement ::@:: If _φ_ : _U_ ⊆ __R__<sup>_n_</sup> → __R__ is a [differentiable function](../../../../general/differentiable%20function.md) and _γ_ a differentiable curve in _U_ which starts at a point __p__ and ends at a point __q__, then $$\int _{\gamma }\nabla \varphi (\mathbf {r} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} =\varphi \left(\mathbf {q} \right)-\varphi \left(\mathbf {p} \right)$$ where ∇<!-- markdown separator -->_φ_ denotes the gradient vector field of _φ_. <!--SR:!2025-08-24,135,408!2025-08-26,136,408-->
  - gradient theorem / interpretation ::@:: The gradient theorem implies that line integrals through gradient fields are [path-independent](../../../../general/conservative%20vector%20field.md#path%20independence). In physics this theorem is one of the ways of defining a [_conservative_ force](../../../../general/conservative%20force.md). By placing _φ_ as potential, ∇<!-- markdown separator -->_φ_ is a [conservative field](../../../../general/conservative%20field.md). [Work](../../../../general/work%20(physics).md) done by conservative forces does not depend on the path followed by the object, but only the end points, as the above equation shows. <!--SR:!2025-08-29,139,408!2025-09-01,140,407-->
  - gradient theorem / note ::@:: You can choose any path satisfying the conditions going from the starting point to the ending point. It does not affect the result. <p> For a closed curve, the line integral is 0, since the starting point and ending point are identical. <!--SR:!2025-08-17,129,408!2025-08-14,126,408-->
- [divergence theorem](../../../../general/divergence%20theorem.md) ::@:: It states that the [surface integral](../../../../general/surface%20integral.md) of a vector field over a closed surface, which is called the "flux" through the surface, is equal to the [volume integral](../../../../general/volume%20integral.md) of the divergence over the region enclosed by the surface. <!--SR:!2025-08-25,136,408!2025-08-18,130,408-->
  - divergence theorem / mathematical statement ::@:: Suppose _V_ is a [subset](../../../../general/subset.md) of $\mathbb {R} ^{n}$ \(in the case of _n_ = 3, _V_ represents a volume in [three-dimensional space](../../../../general/three-dimensional%20space.md)\) which is [compact](../../../../general/compact%20space.md) and has a [piecewise](../../../../general/piecewise.md) [smooth boundary](../../../../general/smooth%20surface.md) _S_ \(also indicated with $\partial V=S$\). If __F__ is a continuously differentiable vector field defined on a [neighborhood](../../../../general/neighbourhood%20(mathematics).md) of _V_, then: $$\iiint _{V}\left(\mathbf {\nabla } \cdot \mathbf {F} \right)\,\mathrm {d} V= \oiint_S (\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {\hat {n} } )\,\mathrm {d} S \,.$$ The left side is a [volume integral](../../../../general/volume%20integral.md) over the volume _V_, and the right side is the [surface integral](../../../../general/surface%20integral.md) over the boundary of the volume _V_. The closed, measurable set $\partial V$ is oriented by outward-pointing [normals](../../../../general/normal%20(geometry).md), and $\mathbf {\hat {n} }$ is the outward pointing unit normal at almost each point on the boundary $\partial V$. <!--SR:!2025-08-07,105,348!2025-07-15,96,388-->
  - divergence theorem / interpretation ::@:: Intuitively, it states that "the sum of all sources of the field in a region \(with sinks regarded as negative sources\) gives the net flux out of the region". <!--SR:!2025-08-16,128,408!2025-08-27,137,408-->
- [Stokes' theorem](../../../../general/Stokes'%20theorem.md) ::@:: The [line integral](../../../../general/line%20integral.md) of a vector field over a loop is equal to the [surface integral](../../../../general/surface%20integral.md) of its _[curl](../../../../general/curl%20(mathematics).md)_ over the enclosed surface. <!--SR:!2025-08-18,130,408!2025-09-02,141,407-->
  - Stokes' theorem / mathematical statement ::@:: Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth oriented surface in $\mathbb {R} ^{3}$ with boundary $\partial \Sigma \equiv \Gamma$. If a vector field $\mathbf {F} (x,y,z)=(F_{x}(x,y,z),F_{y}(x,y,z),F_{z}(x,y,z))$ is defined and has continuous first order [partial derivatives](../../../../general/partial%20derivatives.md) in a region containing $\Sigma$, then $$\iint _{\Sigma }(\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {\Sigma } =\oint _{\partial \Sigma }\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {\Gamma } .$$ More explicitly, the equality says that $${\scriptstyle {\begin{aligned}&\iint _{\Sigma }\left(\left({\frac {\partial F_{z} }{\partial y} }-{\frac {\partial F_{y} }{\partial z} }\right)\,\mathrm {d} y\,\mathrm {d} z+\left({\frac {\partial F_{x} }{\partial z} }-{\frac {\partial F_{z} }{\partial x} }\right)\,\mathrm {d} z\,\mathrm {d} x+\left({\frac {\partial F_{y} }{\partial x} }-{\frac {\partial F_{x} }{\partial y} }\right)\,\mathrm {d} x\,\mathrm {d} y\right)\\&=\oint _{\partial \Sigma }{\Bigl (}F_{x}\,\mathrm {d} x+F_{y}\,\mathrm {d} y+F_{z}\,\mathrm {d} z{\Bigr )}.\end{aligned} } }$$ <!--SR:!2025-08-31,141,408!2026-05-25,333,388-->
  - Stokes' theorem / interpretation ::@:: Recall that curl measures the "twist" of vectors in a vector field. If you add all the "twist" in a surface, it equals the "twist" obtained by going around the boundary. <!--SR:!2025-08-14,126,408!2025-08-17,129,408-->
  - Stokes' theorem / note ::@:: Given a closed curve, you can choose any surface satisfying the conditions with the closed curve as a boundary. It does not affect the result. <p> For a closed surface (enclosing a volume), there is no boundary. In that case, the total "twist" is 0. <!--SR:!2025-08-27,137,408!2025-08-18,130,408-->

- datetime: 2025-03-03T09:00:00+08:00/2025-03-03T10:20:00+08:00
- topic: electric conduction and currents
- [magnetostatics](../../../../general/magnetostatics.md) ::@:: It is the study of magnetic fields in systems where the currents are steady (not changing with time). It is the magnetic analogue of electrostatics, where the charges are stationary. <!--SR:!2025-08-21,132,408!2025-08-25,136,408-->
  - magnetostatics / vs. electrostatics ::@:: There are many similarities. The main difference is that while there are free electric monopoles \(free electric charges\), there are no free magnetic monopoles. <p> Thus it does not make sense to have a test magnetic monopole. Rather, we have test magnetic dipoles of magnetic moment __m__, and we calculate its magnetic moment ___τ___ \(see below\). <!--SR:!2025-08-12,124,408!2025-08-26,136,408-->
- [magnetic moment](../../../../general/magnetic%20moment.md) ::@:: It is the combination of strength and orientation of a magnet or other object or system that exerts a magnetic field. The magnetic dipole moment of an object determines the magnitude of torque the object experiences in a given magnetic field. <!--SR:!2025-08-25,136,408!2025-08-25,136,408-->
  - magnetic moment / definition ::@:: The relationship is given by: $${\boldsymbol {\tau } }=\mathbf {m} \times \mathbf {B}$$ where ___τ___ is the torque acting on the dipole, __B__ is the external magnetic field, and __m__ is the magnetic moment.  <p> More concretely, it can be defined as: $$\mathbf m(\mathbf r) = \int_V \! (\mathbf r' - \mathbf r) \times \mathbf J(\mathbf r') \,\mathrm d^3 \mathbf r' \,,$$ where $\mathbf r$ is a reference point. To derive this, consider the force per volume is $\mathbf J \times \mathbf B$, and thus the torque per volume is $(\mathbf r' - \mathbf r) \times \mathbf J \times \mathbf B$. Then we see $(\mathbf r' - \mathbf r) \times \mathbf J$ gives the magnetic moment per volume. <p> For a magnetic dipole, the above expression gives the same result no matter what $\mathbf r$ is. So we can just remove the argument $\mathbf r$ for magnetic dipoles \(which is always applicable unless you consider magnetic monopoles existing\). <!--SR:!2026-06-03,363,408!2025-07-02,89,388-->
    - magnetic moment / definition / analogy ::@:: For electric dipole moment, it can be defined as: $$\mathbf p(\mathbf r) = \int_V \! (\mathbf r' - \mathbf r) \rho(\mathbf r') \,\mathrm d^3 \mathbf r' \,,$$ where $\mathbf r$ is a reference point. (Whether $\rho$ includes _bound_ charges depends on the calculation context.) <p> Similarly, for magnetic moment, it can be defined as: $$\mathbf m(\mathbf r) = \int_V \! (\mathbf r' - \mathbf r) \times \mathbf J(\mathbf r') \,\mathrm d^3 \mathbf r' \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-14,46,373!2025-08-30,114,413-->
- [electric current](../../../../general/electric%20current.md) ::@:: It is a flow of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, moving through an electrical conductor or space.

  - electric current / experiment: electric current and conductivity of ions ::@:: We cannot conduct electricity through deionized \(DI\) water. But we can do so after adding sodium chloride \(NaCl\) to the DI water, which creates ions. <!--SR:!2025-08-25,136,408!2025-08-28,138,408-->
- [current density](../../../../general/current%20density.md) ::@:: It is the amount of charge per unit time that flows through a unit area of a chosen cross section. <!--SR:!2025-07-16,96,388!2025-08-13,125,408-->
  - current density / drift velocity ::@:: The velocity the charges drift at can be calculated from the equation: $$\mathbf J = n q \mathbf v \,,$$ where <p> - $n$ is number of charged particles per unit volume \(or charge carrier density\) <br/> - $\mathbf v$ is the [drift velocity](../../../../general/drift%20velocity.md), and <br/> - $q$ is the charge on each particle. <!--SR:!2025-09-08,142,420!2025-07-20,101,400-->
  - current density / to current through an area ::@:: The [surface integral](../../../../general/surface%20integral.md) of __j__ over a [surface](surface%20(mathematics).md) _S_ gives the total amount of current flowing through the surface: $$I=\iint _{S}\mathbf {j} \cdot \mathbf {\hat {n} } \,dA.$$ More concisely, this is the [flux](flux.md) of __j__ across _S_. <!--SR:!2025-08-18,130,408!2025-08-30,140,408-->
- [continuity equation](../../../../general/continuity%20equation.md) ::@:: It is an equation that describes the transport of some quantity. It is particularly simple and powerful when applied to a conserved quantity, but it can be generalized to apply to any extensive quantity. <!--SR:!2025-08-26,136,408!2025-08-30,140,408-->
  - continuity equation / vs. conservation laws ::@:: They are a stronger, local form of conservation laws. Conservation laws does not rule out the possibility that a quantity could disappear from one point while simultaneously appearing at another point. A stronger statement is that quantity is locally conserved: quantity can neither be created nor destroyed, nor can it "teleport" from one place to another—it can only move by a continuous flow. A continuity equation is the mathematical way to express this kind of statement. <!--SR:!2025-08-29,139,408!2025-08-16,128,408-->
  - continuity equation / integral form ::@:: Mathematically, the integral form of the continuity equation expressing the rate of increase of _q_ within a volume _V_ is: $${\frac {dq}{dt} }+\oint _{S}\mathbf {j} \cdot d\mathbf {S} =\Sigma$$ where <p> - _S_ is any imaginary [closed surface](../../../../general/closed%20surface.md#closed%20surfaces), that encloses a volume _V_, <br/> - $\oint _{S}d\mathbf {S}$ denotes a [surface integral](../../../../general/surface%20integral.md) over that closed surface, <br/> - _q_ is the total amount of the quantity in the volume _V_, <br/> - __j__ is the flux of _q_, <br/> - _t_ is time, <br/> - Σ is the net rate that _q_ is being generated inside the volume _V_ per unit time. <!--SR:!2025-08-24,135,408!2025-08-23,134,408-->
  - continuity equation / differential form ::@:: By the [divergence theorem](../../../../general/divergence%20theorem.md), a general continuity equation can also be written in a "differential form": $${\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t} }+\nabla \cdot \mathbf {j} =\sigma$$ where <p> - ∇⋅ is [divergence](../../../../general/divergence.md), <br/> - _ρ_ is the density of the amount _q_ \(i.e. the quantity _q_ per unit volume\), <br/> - __j__ is the flux of _q_ \(i.e. __j__ = ρ<!-- markdown separator -->__v__, where __v__ is the vector field describing the movement of the quantity _q_\), <br/> - _t_ is time, <br/> - _σ_ is the generation of _q_ per unit volume per unit time. <!--SR:!2025-08-24,135,408!2025-08-25,136,408-->
  - continuity equation / electromagnetism ::@:: It states that the [divergence](../../../../general/divergence.md) of the [current density](../../../../general/current%20density.md) __J__ \(in [amperes](../../../../general/amperes.md) per square meter\) is equal to the negative rate of change of the [charge density](../../../../general/charge%20density.md) _ρ_ \(in [coulombs](../../../../general/coulomb.md) per cubic meter\), $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf {J} =-{\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t} }$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-15,96,388!2025-08-27,137,408-->
- electric current
  - electric current / drift speed ::@:: The speed they drift at can be calculated from the equation: $$I=nAvQ\,,$$ where <p> - $I$ is the electric current <br/> - $n$ is number of charged particles per unit volume \(or charge carrier density\) <br/> - $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the conductor <br/> - $v$ is the [drift velocity](../../../../general/drift%20velocity.md), and <br/> - $Q$ is the charge on each particle. <!--SR:!2025-08-15,127,408!2026-02-05,252,388-->
- continuity equation
  - continuity equation / electromagnetism
    - continuity equation / electromagnetism / stationary ::@:: When $\frac {\partial \rho} {\partial t} = 0$, this is the stationary case. Then we can derive that current remains the same across any cross section of a wire and Kirchhoff's junction rule. <!--SR:!2025-08-30,140,408!2026-05-31,340,388-->
- [Kirchhoff's circuit laws](../../../../general/Kirchhoff's%20circuit%20laws.md) ::@:: They are two equalities that deal with the current and potential difference (commonly known as voltage) in the lumped element model of electrical circuits. They were first described in 1845 by German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff. <!--SR:!2025-08-14,126,408!2025-08-31,141,408-->
  - Kirchhoff's junction rule ::@:: Recalling that current is a signed \(positive or negative\) quantity reflecting direction towards or away from a node, this principle can be succinctly stated as: $$\sum _{i=1}^{n}I_{i}=0$$ where _n_ is the total number of branches with currents flowing towards or away from the node. <!--SR:!2025-08-25,136,408!2025-08-25,136,408-->
- [Ohm's law](Ohm's%20law.md) ::@:: It states that the [electric current](../../../../general/electric%20current.md) through a [conductor](../../../../general/electrical%20conductor.md) between two [points](../../../../general/node%20(circuits).md) is directly [proportional](../../../../general/proportionality%20(mathematics).md) to the [voltage](voltage.md) across the two points. <!--SR:!2025-08-15,127,408!2025-09-02,141,407-->
  - Ohm's law / equations ::@:: Introducing the constant of proportionality, the [resistance](../../../../general/electrical%20resistance.md), one arrives at the three mathematical equations used to describe this relationship: $$V=IR\quad {\text{or} }\quad I={\frac {V}{R} }\quad {\text{or} }\quad R={\frac {V}{I} }$$ where _I_ is the current through the conductor, _V_ is the voltage measured across the conductor and _R_ is the [resistance](../../../../general/electrical%20resistance.md) of the conductor. <!--SR:!2025-08-17,129,408!2025-08-18,130,408-->

However some materials do not obey Ohm's law; these are called [non-ohmic](../../../../general/non-ohmic%20resistance.md#static%20and%20differential%20resistance). <!--SR:!2025-08-24,135,408!2025-08-25,136,408-->
    - Ohm's law / validity / examples ::@:: Ohmic resistors obey Ohm's law: typical metal wire at typical temperature, etc. <br/> non-Ohmic resistors do not obey Ohm's law: semiconductor diode \(positive current increases nonlinearly with positive voltage; negative current is very little even with increasing negative voltage\), etc. <!--SR:!2025-09-01,140,407!2025-08-17,129,408-->
  - Ohm's law / vector form ::@:: is also used to refer to various generalizations of the law; for example the [vector](../../../../general/vector%20(mathematics%20and%20physics).md) form of the law used in [electromagnetics](../../../../general/electromagnetics.md) and material science: $$\mathbf {J} =\sigma \mathbf {E} ,$$ where __J__ is the [current density](../../../../general/current%20density.md) at a given location in a resistive material, __E__ is the electric field at that location, and _σ_ \([sigma](../../../../general/sigma.md)\) is a material-dependent parameter called the [conductivity](../../../../general/electrical%20conductivity.md), defined as the [inverse](../../../../general/inverse%20function.md) of [resistivity](../../../../general/electrical%20resistivity%20and%20conductivity.md) _ρ_ \([rho](../../../../general/rho.md)\). <p> In this case, Ohm's law refers to the conductivity _σ_ being independent of the electric field __E__. <!--SR:!2025-08-15,127,408!2025-08-25,136,408-->

  - electrical resistivity and conductivity / Pouillet's law ::@:: Assuming the electric field and electrical resistivity throughout a wire of length $\ell$ and area $A$ is constant. Then we have $$\lvert \mathbf E \rvert = \rho \lvert \mathbf J \rvert \implies \frac V \ell = \rho \frac I A \implies V = \rho \frac \ell A I \,,$$ where $$R = \rho \frac \ell A$$ can be identified as the _electrical resistance_ $R$. The latter equation is known as __Pouillet's law__. <!--SR:!2025-08-29,139,408!2025-08-25,136,408-->

  - electromotive force / motivation ::@:: Consider applying an electric field to a conductor. Charges inside would create a current temporarily, which is soon stopped by the build-up of charges at the ends, as the electric field inside the conductor is now zero. This is exactly same as the situation of an ideal conductor in an electric field. <p> For a current to last, the charges must be part of a _closed_ circuit. Additionally, something needs to _push_ it, thus we have electromotive force \(which is not actually a physical force\). <!--SR:!2025-09-09,145,413!2025-09-09,145,413-->
  - electromotive force / sources ::@:: Devices called electrical _[transducers](../../../../general/transducer.md)_ provide an emf by [converting](../../../../general/energy%20transformation.md) other forms of [energy](../../../../general/energy.md) into [electrical energy](../../../../general/electrical%20energy.md). Other types of electrical equipment also produce an emf, such as [batteries](../../../../general/battery%20(electricity).md), which convert [chemical energy](../../../../general/chemical%20energy.md), and [generators](../../../../general/electric%20generator.md), which convert [mechanical energy](../../../../general/mechanical%20energy.md). This energy conversion is achieved by [physical forces](../../../../general/force.md) applying [physical work](../../../../general/work%20(physics).md) on [electric charges](../../../../general/electric%20charge.md). <!--SR:!2025-08-30,137,413!2025-07-12,95,393-->
  - electromotive force / vs. potential difference ::@:: They are formally distinct concepts: <p> - Potential difference is a more general term that includes emf. <br/> - Emf is the cause of a potential difference. <br/> - In a circuit of a voltage source and a resistor, the sum of the source's applied voltage plus the ohmic voltage drop through the resistor is zero. But the resistor provides no emf, only the voltage source does: <br/> &emsp; - For a circuit using a battery source, the emf is due solely to the chemical forces in the battery. <br/> &emsp; - For a circuit using an electric generator, the emf is due solely to a time-varying magnetic forces within the generator. <br/> - Both a 1 volt emf and a 1 volt potential difference correspond to 1 joule per coulomb of charge. <!--SR:!2025-09-06,142,413!2025-08-29,136,413-->
- Kirchhoff's circuit laws
  - Kirchhoff's voltage law ::@:: Similarly to Kirchhoff's current law, the voltage law can be stated as: $$\sum _{i=1}^{n}V_{i}=0$$ Here, _n_ is the total number of voltages measured. <!--SR:!2025-09-04,140,413!2025-09-05,141,413-->
- electromotive force
  - electromotive force / circuit ::@:: In a circuit of a voltage source and a resistor, the sum of the source's applied voltage \(emf\) plus the ohmic voltage drop \(_not_ emf\) through the resistor is zero. <p> That is, when a charge moves through the source, it gains energy. When a charge moves through the resistor, it loses energy. When it finishes a cycle, it has the same energy as it started \(same potential\). <!--SR:!2025-07-10,93,393!2025-09-12,148,413-->
- [internal resistance](../../../../general/internal%20resistance.md) ::@:: In [electrical engineering](../../../../general/electrical%20engineering.md), a practical [electric power source](../../../../general/power%20supply.md) which is a [linear circuit](../../../../general/linear%20circuit.md) may, according to [Thévenin's theorem](../../../../general/Thévenin's%20theorem.md), be represented as an ideal [voltage source](../../../../general/voltage%20source.md) in [series](../../../../general/series%20and%20parallel%20circuits.md) with an [impedance](../../../../general/electrical%20impedance.md). This impedance is termed the __\(this\)__ of the source. <!--SR:!2025-09-09,145,413!2025-09-06,142,413-->
  - internal resistance / impedance ::@:: It is the opposition to [alternating current](../../../../general/alternating%20current.md) presented by the combined effect of [resistance](../../../../general/electrical%20resistance.md) and [reactance](../../../../general/electrical%20reactance.md) in a [circuit](../../../../general/electrical%20circuit.md). \(__this course__: for simplicity, we only consider resistance right now\) <!--SR:!2025-09-10,146,413!2025-09-07,143,413-->
  - internal resistance / electromotive force ::@:: As a result of internal resistance, the actual potential difference between the terminals of a practical battery is: $$V_{ab} = \varepsilon - Ir \,,$$ where $r$ is its internal resistance. Thus, with a resistor of resistance $R$, we have $\varepsilon - Ir - IR = 0$. <!--SR:!2025-08-29,136,413!2025-09-05,141,413-->
- [Lorentz force](../../../../general/Lorentz%20force.md) ::@:: The __Lorentz force law__ is the combination of electric and magnetic [force](../../../../general/force.md) on a [point charge](../../../../general/point%20charge.md#point%20charge) due to [electromagnetic fields](../../../../general/electromagnetic%20field.md). The __Lorentz force__, on the other hand, is a [physical effect](../../../../general/phenomenon.md) that occurs in the vicinity of electrically neutral, current-carrying conductors causing moving electrical charges to experience a __magnetic force__. <!--SR:!2025-08-27,134,413!2025-07-23,99,393-->
  - Lorentz force / experiment: magnetic force on a current carrying wire ::@:: A permanent magnet applies force on a current carrying wire. Reversing the current direction or the magnet orientation \(but not both at the same time\) reverses the force direction. <!--SR:!2025-09-07,143,413!2025-08-27,134,413-->
  - Lorentz force / experiment: magnetic force on an electric beam ::@:: A permanent magnet deflects an electron beam when the magnetic orientation is not parallel to the beam direction. Reversing the magnet orientation reverses the deflection direction. <!--SR:!2025-07-11,94,393!2025-09-08,144,413-->
  - Lorentz force / equation ::@:: It states that a particle of charge _q_ moving with a velocity __v__ in an [electric field](../../../../general/electric%20field.md) __E__ and a [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md) __B__ experiences a force \(in [SI units](../../../../general/International%20System%20of%20Units.md) of $$\mathbf {F} =q\left(\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} \right).$$ <!--SR:!2025-09-04,140,413!2026-06-04,343,393-->
    - Lorentz force / equation / interpretation ::@:: It says that the electromagnetic force on a charge _q_ is a combination of \(1\) a force in the direction of the electric field __E__ \(proportional to the magnitude of the field and the quantity of charge\), and \(2\) a force at right angles to both the magnetic field __B__ and the velocity __v__ of the charge \(proportional to the magnitude of the field, the charge, and the velocity\). <p> We also notice that the magnetic force does _not_ do work on electric charges, since it is always perpendicular to the velocity. <!--SR:!2025-07-21,97,393!2025-08-26,133,413-->
- [cyclotron motion](../../../../general/cyclotron%20motion.md) ::@:: It refers to the [circular motion](../../../../general/circular%20motion.md) exhibited by [charged particles](../../../../general/charged%20particle.md) in a uniform [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md). <!--SR:!2025-08-28,135,413!2025-08-28,135,413-->
  - cyclotron motion / Lorentz force ::@:: If a particle with electric charge $q$ and mass $m$ is moving with velocity ${\vec {v} }$ in a uniform magnetic field ${\vec {B} }$, then it will experience a [Lorentz force](../../../../general/Lorentz%20force.md) given by $${\vec {F} }=q({\vec {v} }\times {\vec {B} }).$$ The direction of the force is given by the [cross product](../../../../general/cross%20product.md) of the velocity and magnetic field. Thus, the Lorentz force will always act perpendicular to the direction of motion, causing the particle to [gyrate](../../../../general/gyration.md), or move in a circle. <!--SR:!2025-08-24,131,413!2025-09-10,146,413-->
  - cyclotron motion / cyclotron radius ::@:: The radius of this circle, $r_{\rm {c} }$, can be determined by equating the magnitude of the Lorentz force to the [centripetal force](../../../../general/centripetal%20force.md) as $${\frac {mv_{\perp }^{2} }{r_{\rm {c} } } }=|q|v_{\perp }B.$$ Rearranging, the cyclotron radius can be expressed as $$r_{\rm {c} }={\frac {mv_{\perp } }{|q|B} }.$$ Thus, the cyclotron radius is [directly proportional](../../../../general/directly%20proportional.md#direct%20proportionality) to the particle mass and perpendicular velocity, while it is inversely proportional to the particle electric charge and the magnetic field strength. <!--SR:!2026-01-16,232,373!2025-07-20,96,393-->
  - cyclotron motion / cyclotron frequency ::@:: The time it takes the particle to complete one revolution, called the [period](../../../../general/frequency.md#definitions%20and%20units), can be calculated to be $$T_{\rm {c} }={\frac {2\pi r_{\rm {c} } }{v_{\perp } } }.$$ The period is the [reciprocal](../../../../general/multiplicative%20inverse.md) of the cyclotron frequency: $$f_{\rm {c} }={\frac {1}{T_{\rm {c} } } }={\frac {|q|B}{2\pi m} }$$ or $$\omega _{\rm {c} }={\frac {|q|B}{m} }.$$ The cyclotron frequency is independent of the radius and velocity and therefore independent of the particle's kinetic energy; in the non-relativistic limit all particles with the same charge-to-mass ratio rotate around magnetic field lines with the same frequency. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,169,353!2026-07-12,382,393-->
  - cyclotron motion / parallel velocity ::@:: The velocity component parallel to the uniform magnetic field is unaffected. <!--SR:!2025-09-06,142,413!2025-08-25,132,413-->
- Lorentz force
  - Lorentz force / Laplace force ::@:: When a wire carrying an electric current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire \(sometimes called the __Laplace force__\). <!--SR:!2025-08-27,134,413!2025-07-11,94,393-->
    - Lorentz force / Laplace force / equation ::@:: If, in addition, the magnetic field is inhomogeneous, the net force on a stationary rigid wire carrying a steady current _I_ is given by integration along the wire, $$\mathbf {F} =I\int \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell } }\times \mathbf {B} .$$ \(This assumes the current is the same across the wire, which is typically the case.\) <!--SR:!2025-07-10,93,393!2026-01-15,231,373-->
    - Lorentz force / Laplace force / application ::@:: One application of this is [Ampère's force law](Ampère's%20force%20law.md), which describes how two current-carrying wires can attract or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the other's magnetic field. <!--SR:!2025-08-26,133,413!2025-07-12,95,393-->

## week 5 tutorial

- datetime: 2025-03-06T18:00:00+08:00/2025-03-06T18:50:00+08:00
- topic: Drude model
- [Drude model](../../../../general/Drude%20model.md) ::@:: It of [electrical conduction](../../../../general/electrical%20conduction.md) was proposed in 1900 by [Paul Drude](../../../../general/Paul%20Karl%20Ludwig%20Drude.md) to explain the transport properties of [electrons](../../../../general/electron.md) in materials \(especially metals\). <!--SR:!2025-07-11,94,393!2025-09-08,144,413-->
  - Drude model / motivation ::@:: The Drude model attempts to explain the resistivity of a conductor in terms of the scattering of electrons \(the carriers of electricity\) by the relatively immobile ions in the metal that act like obstructions to the flow of electrons. <!--SR:!2025-08-30,137,413!2025-09-04,140,413-->
  - Drude model / description ::@:: The model, which is an application of [kinetic theory](../../../../general/kinetic%20theory%20of%20gases.md), assumes that the microscopic behaviour of electrons in a solid may be treated classically and behaves much like a [pinball](../../../../general/pinball.md) machine, with a sea of constantly jittering electrons bouncing and re-bouncing off heavier, relatively immobile positive ions. <!--SR:!2025-07-25,99,393!2025-07-17,100,393-->
  - Drude model / mathematical treatment
    - Drude model / mathematical treatment / DC field ::@:: The simplest analysis of the Drude model assumes that electric field __E__ is both uniform and constant, and that the thermal velocity of electrons is sufficiently high such that they accumulate only an infinitesimal amount of momentum _d_<!-- markdownlint MD028 -->__p__ between collisions, which occur on average every _τ_ seconds. <!--SR:!2025-08-24,131,413!2025-08-25,132,413-->
      - Drude model / mathematical treatment / DC field / derivation ::@:: Then an electron isolated at time _t_ will on average have been travelling for time _τ_ since its last collision, and consequently will have accumulated momentum $$\Delta \langle \mathbf {p} \rangle =q\mathbf {E} \tau .$$ During its last collision, this electron will have been just as likely to have bounced forward as backward, so all prior contributions to the electron's momentum may be ignored, resulting in the expression $$\langle \mathbf {p} \rangle =q\mathbf {E} \tau .$$ Substituting the relations $${\begin{aligned}\langle \mathbf {p} \rangle &=m\langle \mathbf {v} \rangle ,\\\mathbf {J} &=nq\langle \mathbf {v} \rangle ,\end{aligned} }$$ results in the formulation of Ohm's law mentioned above: $$\mathbf {J} =\left({\frac {nq^{2}\tau }{m} }\right)\mathbf {E} \,,$$ where $n$ is number of charged particles per unit volume \(or charge carrier density\), $q$ is the charge on each particle, and $m$ is the mass of each particle. <!--SR:!2025-09-10,125,333!2026-07-15,385,393-->
      - Drude model / mathematical treatment / DC field / conductivity ::@:: The material can be shown to satisfy Ohm's law $\mathbf {J} =\sigma _{0}\mathbf {E}$ with a [DC](../../../../general/direct%20current.md)-conductivity _σ_<sub>0</sub>: $$\sigma _{0}={\frac {nq^{2}\tau }{m} } \,,$$ where $n$ is number of charged particles per unit volume \(or charge carrier density\), $q$ is the charge on each particle, and $m$ is the mass of each particle. <p> We can see materials with more charge carriers \(higher $n$\), e.g. metals, are more conductive, as opposed to, e.g. insulators. <p> We also see materials with higher collision time $\tau$, e.g. _elemental_ metals, are more conductive, as opposed to, e.g. alloys, which have more disorder. <!--SR:!2026-07-13,383,393!2026-07-14,384,393-->
- [network analysis](../../../../general/network%20analysis%20(electrical%20circuits).md) ::@:: It is the process of finding the [voltages](../../../../general/voltage.md) across, and the [currents](../../../../general/electric%20current.md) through, all network components. There are many techniques for calculating these values; however, for the most part, the techniques assume [linear](../../../../general/linear%20circuit.md) components. Except where stated, the methods described in this article are applicable only to _linear_ network analysis. <!--SR:!2025-08-25,132,413!2025-09-08,144,413-->
  - network analysis / note ::@:: In this course, we consider resistance only instead of impedance for now when doing network analysis. <!--SR:!2025-09-04,140,413!2025-07-30,104,393-->
  - network analysis / series, parallel ::@:: Some two terminal network of impedances can eventually be reduced to a single impedance by successive applications of impedances in series or impedances in parallel. <p> - Impedances in [series](../../../../general/series%20and%20parallel%20circuits.md#series%20circuits): $$Z_{\mathrm {eq} }=Z_{1}+Z_{2}+\,\cdots \,+Z_{n}.$$ <br/> - Impedances in [parallel](../../../../general/series%20and%20parallel%20circuits.md#parallel%20circuits): $${\frac {1}{Z_{\mathrm {eq} } } }={\frac {1}{Z_{1} } }+{\frac {1}{Z_{2} } }+\,\cdots \,+{\frac {1}{Z_{n} } }.$$ <!--SR:!2025-09-04,140,413!2025-09-03,139,413-->
  - network analysis / Kirchhoff's circuit laws ::@:: There are complicated circuits that cannot be reduced by using only series and parallel transformations. To analyze such circuits, we consider as a network of loops and junctions, and apply Kirchhoff's circuit laws on it. <p> \(The concrete steps involved are complex and is not listed here.\) <!--SR:!2025-09-10,146,413!2025-09-05,141,413-->
- [nodal analysis](../../../../general/nodal%20analysis.md) ::@:: It is a method of determining the voltage (potential difference) between "nodes" (points where elements or branches connect) in an electrical circuit in terms of the branch currents. <p> It is essentially a systematic application of Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) for circuit analysis. <!--SR:!2025-09-07,143,413!2025-08-26,133,413-->
- [mesh analysis](../../../../general/mesh%20analysis.md) ::@:: It is a circuit analysis method for planar circuits. Planar circuits are circuits that can be drawn on a plane surface with no wires crossing each other. A more general technique, called _loop analysis_ (with the corresponding network variables called _loop currents_) can be applied to any circuit, planar or not. <p> It makes systematic use of Kirchhoff’s voltage law to arrive at a set of equations guaranteed to be solvable if the circuit has a solution. <!--SR:!2025-09-03,139,413!2025-07-12,95,393-->

- topic: Biot–Savart law
- [Biot–Savart law](../../../../general/Biot–Savart%20law.md) ::@:: It is an equation describing the magnetic field generated by a constant electric current. It relates the magnetic field to the magnitude, direction, length, and proximity of the electric current. <!--SR:!2025-09-07,136,423!2025-09-25,148,423-->
  - Biot–Savart law / experiment ::@:: Applying current to an electric loop deflects a compass needle to a certain direction. Reversing the current reverses the deflection direction. <!--SR:!2025-07-31,103,403!2025-07-31,103,403-->
  - Biot–Savart law / equation ::@:: The equation in [SI](../../../../general/SI.md) units [teslas \(T\)](../../../../general/tesla%20(unit).md) is $$\mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mu _{0} }{4\pi } }\int _{C}{\frac {I\,d{\boldsymbol {\ell } }\times \mathbf {r'} }{|\mathbf {r'} |^{3} } }$$ where $d{\boldsymbol {\ell } }$ is a vector along the path $C$ whose magnitude is the length of the [differential](../../../../general/infinitesimal.md) element of the wire in the direction of _[conventional current](../../../../general/conventional%20current.md#conventions)_, ${\boldsymbol {\ell } }$ is a point on path $C$, and $\mathbf {r'} =\mathbf {r} -{\boldsymbol {\ell } }$ is the full [displacement vector](../../../../general/displacement%20vector.md) from the wire element \($d{\boldsymbol {\ell } }$\) at point ${\boldsymbol {\ell } }$ to the point at which the field is being computed \($\mathbf {r}$\), and _μ_<sub>0</sub> is the [magnetic constant](../../../../general/magnetic%20constant.md). <!--SR:!2025-07-06,79,383!2025-06-30,77,383-->
- [vacuum permeability](../../../../general/vacuum%20permeability.md) ::@:: It is the [magnetic permeability](../../../../general/magnetic%20permeability.md) in a [classical vacuum](../../../../general/classical%20vacuum.md#electromagnetism). It is a [physical constant](../../../../general/physical%20constant.md), conventionally written as ___μ_<sub>0</sub>__ \(pronounced "mu nought" or "mu zero"\). It quantifies the strength of the [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md) induced by an [electric current](../../../../general/electric%20current.md). <!--SR:!2025-09-27,150,423!2025-09-25,148,423-->
  - vacuum permeability / SI units ::@:: Expressed in terms of [SI base units](../../../../general/SI%20base%20units.md), it has the unit kg⋅m⋅s<sup>−2</sup>⋅A<sup>−2</sup>. It can be also expressed in terms of [SI derived units](../../../../general/SI%20derived%20units.md), [N](../../../../general/newton%20(unit).md)⋅A<sup>−2</sup>. <!--SR:!2025-09-17,145,423!2025-09-28,151,423-->
  - vacuum permeability / CODATA ::@:: _μ_<sub>0</sub> = 1.25663706127\(20\)×10<sup>−6</sup> N⋅A<sup>−2</sup> <br/> \(lecture slides: _μ_<sub>0</sub> ≈ 4π×10<sup>−7</sup> N⋅A<sup>−2</sup>\) <!--SR:!2025-07-14,67,323!2025-07-10,82,383-->
  - vacuum permeability / relation with vacuum permittivity ::@:: In the [International System of Quantities](../../../../general/International%20System%20of%20Quantities.md) \(ISQ\), the [speed of light](../../../../general/speed%20of%20light.md) in vacuum, _c_, is related to the magnetic constant and the [electric constant \(vacuum permittivity\)](../../../../general/vacuum%20permittivity.md), _ε_<sub>0</sub>, by the equation: $$c^{2}={1 \over {\mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0} } }.$$ This relation can be derived using [Maxwell's equations](../../../../general/Maxwell's%20equations.md) of classical electromagnetism in the medium of [classical vacuum](../../../../general/vacuum.md#in%20electromagnetism). <!--SR:!2025-07-31,103,403!2025-09-15,143,423-->
- Biot–Savart law
  - Biot–Savart law / infinitely long wire ::@:: We can derive the magnetic field strength at a point due to a straight segment of a current-carrying wire in terms of the initial and final angles from the point to the wire. Then we have $$\frac {\mu_0 I} {4 \pi r} \left(\sin \theta_2 - \sin \theta_1 \right) \,,$$ where $r$ is the closest distance to the wire. <p> Consider $\theta_2 = \pi / 2$ and $\theta_1 = -\pi / 2$ for an _infinitely long wire_. Then we have $$\frac {\mu_0 I} {2 \pi r} \,.$$ We also see that this force has cylindrical symmetry. <!--SR:!2025-09-27,150,423!2025-09-18,146,423-->
- [Ampère's force law](../../../../general/Ampère's%20force%20law.md) ::@:: In [magnetostatics](../../../../general/magnetostatics.md), the force of attraction or repulsion between two [current](../../../../general/electric%20current.md)-carrying wires \(see first figure below\) is often called __\(this\)__. The physical origin of this force is that each wire generates a [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md), following the [Biot–Savart law](../../../../general/Biot–Savart%20law.md), and the other wire experiences a magnetic force as a consequence, following the [Lorentz force law](../../../../general/Lorentz%20force%20law.md). <!--SR:!2025-09-11,140,423!2025-09-09,138,423-->
  - Ampère's force law / equation ::@:: It states that the magnetic force per unit length between two straight parallel conductors is $${\frac {F_{m} }{L} }=2k_{\rm {A} }{\frac {I_{1}I_{2} }{r} },$$ \(annotation: note the denominator is $r$ instead of $r^2$\) where $k_{\rm {A} }$ is the magnetic force constant from the [Biot–Savart law](../../../../general/Biot–Savart%20law.md), $F_{m}/L$ is the total force on either wire per unit length of the shorter \(the longer is approximated as infinitely long relative to the shorter\), $r$ is the distance between the two wires, and $I_{1}$, $I_{2}$ are the [direct currents](../../../../general/direct%20current.md) carried by the wires. <!--SR:!2026-03-26,273,383!2025-09-26,149,423-->
    - Ampère's force law / equation / general case ::@:: For two arbitrary wires, using Biot–Savart law and then Lorentz force law, we can use iterated line integral and cross product to express the equation. It looks like this: $$\mathbf {F} _{12}={\frac {\mu _{0} }{4\pi } }\int _{L_{1} }\int _{L_{2} }{\frac {I_{1}d{\boldsymbol {\ell } }_{1}\ \times \ (I_{2}d{\boldsymbol {\ell } }_{2}\ \times \ {\hat {\mathbf {r} } }_{21})}{|r|^{2} } } \,.$$  where <p> - $\mathbf {F} _{12}$ is the total magnetic force felt by wire 1 due to wire 2 \(usually measured in [newtons](../../../../general/newton%20(unit).md)\), <br/> - $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are the currents running through wires 1 and 2, respectively \(usually measured in [amperes](../../../../general/ampere.md)\), <br/> - The double line integration sums the force upon each element of wire 1 due to the magnetic field of each element of wire 2, <br/> - $d{\boldsymbol {\ell } }_{1}$ and $d{\boldsymbol {\ell } }_{2}$ are infinitesimal vectors associated with wire 1 and wire 2 respectively \(usually measured in [metres](../../../../general/metre.md)\); see [line integral](../../../../general/line%20integral.md) for a detailed definition, <br/> - The vector ${\hat {\mathbf {r} } }_{21}$ is the [unit vector](../../../../general/unit%20vector.md) pointing from the differential element on wire 2 towards the differential element on wire 1, and _\|r\|_ is the distance separating these elements, <br/> - The multiplication __×__ is a [vector cross product](../../../../general/cross%20product.md), <br/> - The sign of $I_{n}$ is relative to the orientation $d{\boldsymbol {\ell } }_{n}$ \(for example, if $d{\boldsymbol {\ell } }_{1}$ points in the direction of [conventional current](conventional%20current.md#conventions), then $I_{1}>0$\). <!--SR:!2025-10-07,131,343!2025-07-01,78,383-->
  - Ampère's force law / effect ::@:: Two wires attract each other if their current directions are the same. Two wires repel each other if their current directions are opposite. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,148,423!2025-09-11,140,423-->
- [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md) ::@:: It is a physical field that describes the magnetic influence on moving electric charges, electric currents, and magnetic materials. <!--SR:!2025-09-24,147,423!2025-09-24,147,423-->
  - magnetic field / experiment ::@:: Iron fillings around a magnetic field source \(e.g. powered solenoids\) experience a torque that aligns them to the magnetic field lines. <!--SR:!2025-09-23,146,423!2025-09-27,150,423-->
  - magnetic field / interpretation ::@:: A moving charge in a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity and to the magnetic field. <p> So what does the magnetic field direction represent? Recall that a magnetic dipole experiences a torque under a magnetic field: $\boldsymbol \tau = \mathbf m \times \mathbf B$. This torque is minimized if the dipole is parallel to the magnetic field direction. <!--SR:!2025-09-14,142,423!2025-09-22,145,423-->
  - magnetic field / visualization ::@:: Similar to electric field lines, it can be visualized using magnetic field lines. <p> The field lines start from the north poles and end at the south poles. The field line is always tangent to the magnetic field direction. The density of field lines indicates the magnetic field magnitude nearby \(denser is higher\). <!--SR:!2025-09-23,146,423!2025-09-27,150,423-->

    - Ampère's circuital law / differential form / derivation ::@:: Stokes' theorem can be used to derive this from the integral form of Ampère's circuital law. <!--SR:!2025-07-30,102,403!2025-09-23,146,423-->
  - Ampère's circuital law / analogy ::@:: This law is to Biot–Savart law like Gauss's law is to Coulomb's law. <!--SR:!2025-09-11,140,423!2025-09-24,147,423-->
  - Ampère's circuital law / application ::@:: We can use it to derive Biot–Savart law again. Or we can use it to derive the magnetic field inside a current-carrying wire with certain thickness \(for outside, it is the same as a wire of negligible thickness\). <!--SR:!2025-09-28,151,423!2025-09-22,145,423-->
- Biot–Savart law
  - Biot–Savart law / equation
    - Biot–Savart law / equation / current density ::@:: The proper formulation of the Biot–Savart law \(again in [SI](../../../../general/SI.md) units\) is: $$\mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mu _{0} }{4\pi } }\iiint _{V}\ {\frac {(\mathbf {J} \, \mathrm dV)\times \mathbf {r} '}{|\mathbf {r} '|^{3} } }$$ where $\mathbf {r'}$ is the vector from $\mathrm dV$ to the observation point $\mathbf {r}$, $\mathrm dV$ is the [volume element](../../../../general/volume%20element.md), and $\mathbf {J}$ is the [current density](../../../../general/current%20density.md) vector in that volume \(in SI in units of A/m<sup>2</sup>\). <!--SR:!2026-02-28,267,383!2026-02-27,266,383-->

We obtain Gauss's law for magnetism. <p> Applying curl and further derivation yields Ampère's circuital law \(without Maxwell's correction\). In particular, it makes use of $\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf r) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \mathbf r) - \nabla^2 \mathbf r$ \(similar to $\mathbf a \times (\mathbf b \times \mathbf c) = (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf c) \mathbf b - (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b) \mathbf c$\). <!--SR:!2026-01-16,205,363!2025-07-31,98,403-->
- [Gauss's law for magnetism](../../../../general/Gauss's%20law%20for%20magnetism.md) ::@:: It is one of the four [Maxwell's equations](../../../../general/Maxwell's%20equations.md) that underlie [classical electrodynamics](../../../../general/classical%20electrodynamics.md). It states that the [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md) __B__ has [divergence](../../../../general/divergence.md) equal to zero, in other words, that it is a [solenoidal vector field](../../../../general/solenoidal%20vector%20field.md). It is equivalent to the statement that [magnetic monopoles](../../../../general/magnetic%20monopole.md) do not exist. Rather than "magnetic charges", the basic entity for magnetism is the [magnetic dipole](../../../../general/magnetic%20dipole.md#field%20from%20a%20magnetic%20dipole). <!--SR:!2025-09-08,137,423!2025-09-28,151,423-->
  - Gauss's law for magnetism / differential form ::@:: It is: $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf {B} =0$$ where ∇ · denotes [divergence](../../../../general/divergence.md), and __B__ is the [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md). <!--SR:!2025-09-15,143,423!2025-09-22,145,423-->
  - Gauss's law for magnetism / integral form ::@:: It states: $$\Phi _{B}= \oiint_S \mathbf {B} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {S} =0$$ where _S_ is any [closed surface](../../../../general/closed%20surface.md#closed%20surfaces) \(see image right\), $\Phi _{B}$ is the magnetic flux through _S_, and d<!-- markdown separator -->__S__ is a [vector](../../../../general/vector%20(geometric).md), whose magnitude is the area of an [infinitesimal](../../../../general/infinitesimal.md) piece of the surface _S_, and whose direction is the outward-pointing [surface normal](../../../../general/surface%20normal.md) \(see [surface integral](../../../../general/surface%20integral.md) for more details\). <!--SR:!2025-09-08,137,423!2025-07-30,102,403-->
- [vector potential](../../../../general/vector%20potential.md) ::@:: It is a [vector field](../../../../general/vector%20field.md) whose [curl](../../../../general/curl%20(mathematics).md) is a given vector field. This is analogous to a _[scalar potential](../../../../general/scalar%20potential.md)_, which is a scalar field whose [gradient](../../../../general/gradient.md) is a given vector field. <p> Formally, given a vector field $\mathbf {v}$, a _vector potential_ is a $C^{2}$ vector field $\mathbf {A}$ such that $$\mathbf {v} =\nabla \times \mathbf {A} .$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-29,102,403!2025-09-16,144,423-->
  - vector potential / consequence ::@:: If a vector field $\mathbf {v}$ admits a vector potential $\mathbf {A}$, then from the equality $$\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf {A} )=0$$ \([divergence](../../../../general/divergence.md) of the [curl](../../../../general/curl%20(mathematics).md) is zero\) one obtains $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} =\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf {A} )=0,$$ which implies that $\mathbf {v}$ must be a [solenoidal vector field](../../../../general/solenoidal%20vector%20field.md). <!--SR:!2025-07-31,103,403!2025-09-17,145,423-->
  - vector potential / non-uniqueness ::@:: The vector potential admitted by a solenoidal field is not unique. If $\mathbf {A}$ is a vector potential for $\mathbf {v}$, then so is $$\mathbf {A} +\nabla f,$$where $f$ is any continuously differentiable scalar function. This follows from the fact that the curl of the gradient is zero. <p> This nonuniqueness leads to a degree of freedom in the formulation of electrodynamics, or gauge freedom, and requires [choosing a gauge](../../../../general/gauge%20fixing.md). <!--SR:!2025-09-07,136,423!2025-09-13,141,423-->
- [magnetic vector potential](../../../../general/magnetic%20vector%20potential.md) ::@:: It is the [vector quantity](vector%20quantity.md) defined so that its [curl](curl%20(mathematics).md) is equal to the [magnetic field](magnetic%20field.md): $\nabla \times \mathbf {A} =\mathbf {B}$. Together with the [electric potential](electric%20potential.md) _φ_, the magnetic vector potential can be used to specify the [electric field](electric%20field.md) __E__ as well. <!--SR:!2025-09-14,142,423!2025-09-24,147,423-->
  - magnetic vector potential / magnetostatics ::@:: In [magnetostatics](../../../../general/magnetostatics.md), if the Coulomb gauge $\ \nabla \cdot \mathbf {A} =0$ is imposed, then one can integrate to obtain the potentials: $$\mathbf {A} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mu _{0} }{4\pi } }\int _{R}{\frac {\mathbf {J} (\mathbf {r} ')}{\left|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r} '\right|} }\mathrm {d} ^{3}r' \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-08-04,107,403!2025-07-01,78,383-->
    - magnetic vector potential / magnetostatics / derivation ::@:: Biot–Savart law can be rewritten into $$\mathbf B(\mathbf r) = \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \nabla_{\mathbf r} \times \iiint_V \! \frac {\mathbf J(\mathbf \ell)} {\lvert \mathbf r - \mathbf \ell \rvert} \,\mathrm dV \,.$$ We exclude the curl operator to define the vector potential. <!--SR:!2025-08-18,110,403!2026-04-16,295,383-->
    - magnetic vector potential / magnetostatics / analogy ::@:: In [magnetostatics](../../../../general/magnetostatics.md), if the Coulomb gauge $\ \nabla \cdot \mathbf {A} =0$ is imposed, then there is an analogy between $\mathbf {A} ,\mathbf {J}$ and $V,\rho$ in [electrostatics](../../../../general/electrostatics.md): $$\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {A} =-\mu _{0}\mathbf {J}$$ just like the electrostatic equation $$\nabla ^{2}V=-{\frac {\rho }{\epsilon _{0} } }$$ Likewise one can integrate to obtain the potentials: $$\mathbf {A} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mu _{0} }{4\pi } }\int _{R}{\frac {\mathbf {J} (\mathbf {r} ')}{\left|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r} '\right|} }\mathrm {d} ^{3}r'$$ just like the equation for the [electric potential](../../../../general/electric%20potential.md): $$V(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0} } }\int _{R}{\frac {\rho (\mathbf {r} ')}{|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r} '|} }\mathrm {d} ^{3}r'$$ <!--SR:!2026-01-05,194,363!2025-08-06,103,403-->
  - magnetic vector potential / gauge choices ::@:: The above definition does not define the magnetic vector potential uniquely because, by definition, we can arbitrarily add [curl](../../../../general/curl%20(mathematics).md)-free components to the magnetic potential without changing the observed magnetic field. Thus, there is a [degree of freedom](../../../../general/degrees%20of%20freedom%20(../../../../general/physics%20and%20chemistry).md) available when choosing $\mathbf {A}$. This condition is known as [gauge invariance](../../../../general/gauge%20invariance.md). <!--SR:!2025-09-18,146,423!2025-09-10,139,423-->
    - magnetic vector potential / gauge choices / common ::@:: The [Lorenz gauge](../../../../general/Lorenz%20gauge.md): $$\ \nabla \cdot \mathbf {A} +{\frac {1}{\ c^{2} } }{\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial t} }=0$$ <br/> The [Coulomb gauge](Coulomb%20gauge.md#Coulomb%20gauge): $$\ \nabla \cdot \mathbf {A} =0$$ <!--SR:!2025-08-19,111,403!2025-07-31,98,403-->

- datetime: 2025-03-20T18:00:00+08:00/2025-03-20T18:50:00+08:00
- topic: boundary value problem of magnetostatics
- magnetic moment
  - magnetic moment / models ::@:: Classically, magnetic moment can be modeled as a magnetic pole \(similar to electric dipoles\) or Ampèrian loop \(what we use nowadays\). <!--SR:!2025-09-25,148,423!2025-09-16,144,423-->
    - magnetic moments / models / magnetic pole ::@:: The sources of magnetic moments in materials can be represented by poles in analogy to [electrostatics](../../../../general/electrostatics.md). This is sometimes known as the Gilbert model. In this model, a small magnet is modeled by a pair of _fictitious_ magnetic monopoles of equal magnitude but opposite [polarity](../../../../general/magnetic%20polarity.md#polarity). Each pole is the source of magnetic force which weakens with distance. <p> The magnetic dipole moment __m__ is related to the fictitious poles as $$\mathbf {m} =p\,\mathrm {\boldsymbol {\ell } } \,.$$ It points in the direction from South to North pole. The analogy with electric dipoles should not be taken too far because magnetic dipoles are associated with [angular momentum](../../../../general/angular%20momentum.md). <!--SR:!2025-07-30,102,403!2025-07-30,102,403-->
    - magnetic moments / models / Ampèrian loop ::@:: In this model developed by Ampère, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small amperian loop of current _I_. The dipole moment of this loop is $$\mathbf {m} =I{\boldsymbol {S} },$$ where _S_ is the area of the loop. The direction of the magnetic moment is in a direction normal to the area enclosed by the current consistent with the direction of the current using the right hand rule. <!--SR:!2025-08-17,109,403!2025-09-25,148,423-->
  - magnetic moment / motivation ::@:: Consider the dipole term of the multipole approximation, but for the magnetic vector potential: $$\mathbf A(\mathbf r) = \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac 1 {r^{k + 1} } \iiint_V \! P_k(\cos \theta) \, \mathbf J(\mathbf \ell) \lvert \mathbf \ell \rvert^k \,\mathrm{d}V \,,$$ where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf r$ and $\mathbf \ell$. <p> The monopole term should disappear because there are no magnetic monopoles. The dipole term, which is dominant unless zero, is: $$\mathbf A_{\text{dip} }(\mathbf r) = \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \frac 1 {r^2} \iiint_V \! \cos \theta \, \mathbf J(\mathbf \ell) \lvert \mathbf \ell \rvert \,\mathrm dV = \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \frac 1 {r^2} \iiint_V \! (\hat{\mathbf r} \cdot \mathbf \ell) \mathbf J(\mathbf \ell) \,\mathrm dV \,.$$ Now if we restrict the current density to a current-carrying loop of current $I$, then we rewrite the integral into a closed loop integral: $$\mathbf A_{\text{dip} }(\mathbf r) = \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \frac I {r^2} \oint_C \! (\hat{\mathbf r} \cdot \mathbf \ell) \, \mathrm d\mathbf \ell$$ Using the identity $\oint_C \! (\mathbf v \cdot \mathbf \ell) \,\mathrm d\mathbf \ell = -\iint_A \! \mathbf v \times \mathrm d\mathbf A$ \(note that $\mathrm d\mathbf \ell$ points in the integration direction, which is different from $\mathbf \ell$\), we have $$\mathbf A_{\text{dip} }(\mathbf r) = -\frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \frac I {r^2} \hat{\mathbf r} \times \iint_A \! \mathrm d\mathbf A = \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \frac {\mathbf m \times \hat {\mathbf r} } {r^2} \,,$$ where $$\mathbf m = I \iint_A \! \mathrm d\mathbf A = I \mathbf A$$ is the _magnetic dipole moment_ we are after. The direction of the area vector follows the right hand rule. <!--SR:!2025-07-03,64,323!2025-07-05,82,383-->
    - magnetic moment / motivation / identity ::@:: $$\oint_C \! (\mathbf v \cdot \mathbf \ell) \,\mathrm d\mathbf \ell = -\iint_A \! \mathbf v \times \mathrm d\mathbf A$$ \(note that $\mathrm d\mathbf \ell$ points in the integration direction, which is different from $\mathbf \ell$\) <!--SR:!2025-07-26,79,392!2025-07-02,6,312-->
  - magnetic moment / magnetic vector potential ::@:: The magnetic vector potential due to an ideal magnetic dipole $\mathbf m$ is $$\mathbf A(\mathbf r) = \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \frac {\mathbf m \times \hat {\mathbf r} } {r^2} \,.$$ Assuming $\mathbf m$ points into the positive $z$-direction. In spherical coordinates: $$\mathbf A(r, \theta, \varphi) = \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \frac {m \sin \theta} {r^2} \hat{\boldsymbol \varphi} \,.$$ <p> Take the curl to find its magnetic field. In spherical coordinates, we need to be careful when taking the curl \(very cursed\). We have: $$\begin{aligned} \mathbf B = \nabla \times \mathbf A & = \frac 1 {r^2 \sin \theta} \begin{vmatrix} \hat{\mathbf r} & r \hat{\boldsymbol \theta} & r \sin \theta \hat{\boldsymbol \varphi} \\ \frac {\partial} {\partial r} & \frac {\partial} {\partial \theta} & \frac {\partial} {\partial \varphi} \\ 0 & r 0 & r \sin \theta \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \frac {m \sin \theta} {r^2} \end{vmatrix} \\ & = \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \frac m {r^3} \left(2 \cos \theta \hat{\mathbf r} + \sin \theta \hat{\boldsymbol \theta} \right) \,. \end{aligned}$$ Notice this is formally similar to that given by an electric dipole. <!--SR:!2025-10-09,133,343!2026-01-20,208,363-->

## week 8 lecture

- datetime: 2025-03-24T09:00:00+08:00/2025-03-24T10:20:00+08:00
- topic: magnetic moment, magnetostatics in materials
- [magnetism](../../../../general/magnetism.md) ::@:: It is the class of physical attributes that occur through a magnetic field, which allows objects to attract or repel each other. Because both electric currents and magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, magnetism is one of two aspects of electromagnetism. <!--SR:!2025-11-04,159,432!2025-11-06,161,433-->
  - magnetism / types ::@:: 3 common ones: diamagnetism, ferromagnetism, paramagnetism; there are more unmentioned here <!--SR:!2025-10-21,145,432!2025-10-27,151,433-->
- [paramagnetism](../../../../general/paramagnetism.md) ::@:: In a paramagnetic material there are unpaired electrons; i.e., atomic or molecular orbitals with exactly one electron in them. While paired electrons are required by the Pauli exclusion principle to have their intrinsic ('spin') magnetic moments pointing in opposite directions, causing their magnetic fields to cancel out, an unpaired electron is free to align its magnetic moment in any direction. When an external magnetic field is applied, these magnetic moments will tend to align themselves in the same direction as the applied field, thus reinforcing it. <!--SR:!2025-07-31,84,393!2025-08-29,114,412-->
  - paramagnetism / torque ::@:: Consider a rectangular current loop. In a magnetic field, the rectangular current loop experience a torque by $\boldsymbol \tau = \mathbf m \times \mathbf B$. <p> This can be derived by considering the force on two sides of the rectangular current loop. <!--SR:!2025-11-04,159,433!2025-10-29,153,433-->
- [diamagnetism](../../../../general/diamagnetism.md) ::@:: Diamagnetism appears in all materials and is the tendency of a material to oppose an applied magnetic field, and therefore, to be repelled by a magnetic field. <p> In a diamagnetic material, there are no unpaired electrons, so the intrinsic electron magnetic moments cannot produce any bulk effect \(no paramagnetism\). In these cases, the magnetization arises from the electrons' orbital motions, which can be understood classically. <!--SR:!2025-07-29,82,393!2025-11-04,159,433-->
  - diamagnetism / classical understanding ::@:: When a material is put in a magnetic field, the electrons circling the nucleus will experience, in addition to their Coulomb attraction to the nucleus, a Lorentz force from the magnetic field. Depending on which direction the electron is orbiting, this force may increase the centripetal force on the electrons, pulling them in towards the nucleus, or it may decrease the force, pulling them away from the nucleus. This effect systematically increases the orbital magnetic moments that were aligned opposite the field and decreases the ones aligned parallel to the field (in accordance with Lenz's law). This results in a small bulk magnetic moment, with an opposite direction to the applied field. <!--SR:!2025-07-26,79,392!2025-08-31,116,413-->
  - diamagnetism / paramagnetism ::@:: In a material with paramagnetic properties (that is, with a tendency to enhance an external magnetic field), the paramagnetic behavior dominates. Thus, despite its universal occurrence, diamagnetic behavior is observed only in a purely diamagnetic material. <!--SR:!2025-09-01,116,413!2025-10-26,150,432-->
- [ferromagnetism](../../../../general/ferromagnetism.md) ::@:: A ferromagnet, like a paramagnetic substance, has unpaired electrons. However, in addition to the electrons' intrinsic magnetic moment's tendency to be parallel to an applied field, there is also in these materials a tendency for these magnetic moments to orient parallel to each other to maintain a lowered-energy state. Thus, even in the absence of an applied field, the magnetic moments of the electrons in the material spontaneously line up parallel to one another. <!--SR:!2025-10-28,152,433!2025-10-19,143,432-->
  - ferromagnetism / examples ::@:: Ferromagnetism only occurs in a few substances; common ones are iron, nickel, cobalt, their alloys, and some alloys of rare-earth metals. <!--SR:!2025-10-24,148,433!2025-10-22,146,432-->
  - ferromagnetism / magnetic domains ::@:: Within each domain, the spins are aligned, but if the bulk material is in its lowest energy configuration (i.e. "unmagnetized"), the spins of separate domains point in different directions and their magnetic fields cancel out, so the bulk material has no net large-scale magnetic field. <!--SR:!2025-11-04,159,433!2025-11-05,160,432-->
  - ferromagnetism / magnetized materials ::@:: The magnetic domains in a material are not fixed in place; they are simply regions where the spins of the electrons have aligned spontaneously due to their magnetic fields, and thus can be altered by an external magnetic field. If a strong-enough external magnetic field is applied to the material, the domain walls will move via a process in which the spins of the electrons in atoms near the wall in one domain turn under the influence of the external field to face in the same direction as the electrons in the other domain, thus reorienting the domains so more of the dipoles are aligned with the external field. The domains will remain aligned when the external field is removed, and sum to create a magnetic field of their own extending into the space around the material, thus creating a "permanent" magnet. <!--SR:!2025-08-30,115,412!2025-10-21,145,432-->
    - ferromagnetism / magnetized materials / stability ::@:: The domains do not go back to their original minimum energy configuration when the field is removed because the domain walls tend to become 'pinned' or 'snagged' on defects in the crystal lattice, preserving their parallel orientation. <!--SR:!2025-10-27,151,433!2025-09-01,116,413-->
- [magnetization](../../../../general/magnetization.md) ::@:: It is the vector field that expresses the density of permanent or induced magnetic dipole moments in a magnetic material. Accordingly, physicists and engineers usually define magnetization as the quantity of magnetic moment per unit volume. It is represented by a pseudovector __M__. Magnetization can be compared to electric polarization, which is the measure of the corresponding response of a material to an electric field in electrostatics. <!--SR:!2025-07-30,83,393!2025-11-05,160,433-->
  - magnetization / definition ::@:: The magnetization field or __M__-field can be defined according to the following equation: $$\mathbf {M} ={\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {m} }{\mathrm {d} V} }$$ Where $\mathrm {d} \mathbf {m}$ is the elementary [magnetic moment](../../../../general/magnetic%20moment.md) and  $\mathrm {d} V$ is the [volume element](../../../../general/volume%20element.md); in other words, the __M__-field is the distribution of magnetic moments in the region or [manifold](../../../../general/manifold.md) concerned. This is better illustrated through the following relation: $$\mathbf {m} =\iiint \mathbf {M} \,\mathrm {d} V$$ where __m__ is an ordinary magnetic moment and the triple integral denotes integration over a volume. <!--SR:!2025-11-05,160,432!2025-10-27,151,432-->
    - magnetization / definition / analogy ::@:: This makes the __M__-field completely analogous to the [electric polarization field](../../../../general/polarization%20density.md), or __P__-field, used to determine the [electric dipole moment](../../../../general/electric%20dipole%20moment.md) __p__ generated by a similar region or manifold with such a polarization: $$\mathbf {P} ={\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p} \over \mathrm {d} V},\quad \mathbf {p} =\iiint \mathbf {P} \,\mathrm {d} V,$$where $\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p}$ is the elementary electric dipole moment. <!--SR:!2025-10-23,147,432!2025-10-25,149,432-->
  - magnetization / unit ::@:: The __M__-field is measured in _[amperes](../../../../general/ampere.md) per [meter](../../../../general/meter.md)_ \(A/m\) in [SI units](../../../../general/SI%20units.md). <!--SR:!2025-09-01,116,413!2025-08-13,59,393-->
  - magnetization / magnetization current ::@:: The magnetic vector potential due to a magnetized material is: $$\mathbf A(\mathbf r) = \frac {\mu_0} {4 \pi} \iiint_V \! \frac {\mathbf M(\mathbf \ell) \times \mathbf (\mathbf r - \mathbf \ell) } {\lvert \mathbf r -\mathbf \ell \rvert^3} \,\mathrm dV \,.$$ Using the product rule for $\nabla \times$, we have $$\begin{aligned} \mathbf A(\mathbf r) & = \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \iiint_V \! \mathbf M(\mathbf \ell) \times \nabla_{\mathbf \ell} \left(\frac 1 {\lvert \mathbf r - \mathbf \ell \rvert} \right) \,\mathrm dV \\ & = \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \iiint_V \! \frac 1 {\lvert \mathbf r - \mathbf \ell \rvert} \nabla_{\mathbf \ell} \times \mathbf M(\mathbf \ell) \,\mathrm dV - \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \iiint_V \! \nabla_{\mathbf \ell} \times \left( \frac {\mathbf M(\mathbf \ell)} {\lvert \mathbf r - \mathbf \ell \rvert} \right) \,\mathrm dV \,. \end{aligned}$$ Using the identity $\iiint_V \! \nabla \times \mathbf v \,\mathrm dV = -\oiint_S \! \mathbf v \times \mathrm d\mathbf A$, we have $$\mathbf A(\mathbf r) = \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \iiint_V \! \frac 1 {\lvert \mathbf r - \mathbf \ell \rvert} \nabla_{\mathbf \ell} \times \mathbf M(\mathbf \ell) \,\mathrm dV + \frac {\mu_0} {4\pi} \oiint_S \! \frac 1 {\lvert \mathbf r - \mathbf \ell \rvert} \mathbf M(\mathbf \ell) \times \mathrm d\mathbf A \,.$$ We can identify $\nabla_{\mathbf \ell} \times \mathbf M(\mathbf \ell)$ with a bound volume current $\mathbf J_m$ and $\mathbf M(\mathbf \ell) \times \mathrm d\hat{\mathbf A}$ with a bound surface current $\mathbf K_m$. <!--SR:!2025-07-18,79,393!2025-07-01,62,373-->
    - magnetization / magnetization current / identity ::@:: $$\iiint_V \! \nabla \times \mathbf v \,\mathrm dV = -\oiint_S \! \mathbf v \times \mathrm d\mathbf S$$ This identity can be obtained from the generalized Stokes' theorem, where the integral of a differential form $\omega$ over the [boundary](../../../../general/boundary%20of%20a%20manifold.md#manifold%20with%20boundary) $\partial \Omega$ of some [orientable](../../../../general/orientation%20(vector%20space).md#orientation%20on%20manifolds) manifold $\Omega$ is equal to the integral of its [exterior derivative](../../../../general/exterior%20derivative.md) $d\omega$ over the whole of $\Omega$, i.e., $$\oint _{\partial \Omega } \! \lvert \mathrm dS \rvert \hat {\mathbf n} A =\int _{\Omega } \lvert \mathrm dV \rvert \nabla A \,.$$ When $A$ is a vector field $\mathbf A$, the equation splits into two parts, with one of them being the exterior product \(the other is similar but with the dot product\): $$\oint_{\partial \Omega} \! \lvert \mathrm dS \rvert \hat {\mathbf n} \wedge \mathbf A = \oint_{\Omega} \lvert \mathrm dV \rvert \nabla \wedge \mathbf A \,.$$ In three dimensions, using Hodge duality, we have $$\oint_{\partial \Omega} \! \lvert \mathrm dS \rvert \hat {\mathbf n} \times \mathbf A = \oint_\Omega \lvert \mathrm dV \rvert \nabla \times \mathbf A \,,$$ which is the above identity. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,58,372!2025-07-28,81,393-->
    - magnetization / magnetization current / intuition ::@:: In the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called _bound current_. This bound current, then, is the source of the magnetic __B__ field due to the magnet. <p> The above says a magnetized object can be replaced by a volume current $\mathbf J_m = \nabla \times \mathbf M$ \(_magnetization current density_\) through the material plus a surface current $\mathbf K_m = \mathbf M \times \hat {\mathbf n}$ on the material surface \(_polarization current density_\). We can think of a magnetized material consist of many Amperian loops. When the microscopic currents induced by the magnetization do not balance out, bound volume currents and bound surface currents appear in the medium. <!--SR:!2025-07-27,80,393!2025-07-30,83,393-->
    - magnetization / magnetization current / figure ::@:: ![magnetization current](../../../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Bound%20currents.gif) <!--SR:!2025-10-27,151,433!2025-10-29,153,432-->
    - magnetization / magnetization current / Ampere's circuital law ::@:: For simplicity, we ignore the polarization current density \(as we will see later, the term due to the polarization current density can be considered part of Maxwell's correction for the magnetizing field\). Thus $\mathbf J_b = \mathbf J_m = \nabla \times \mathbf M$. Then we have $$\frac 1 {\mu_0} \nabla \times \mathbf B = \mathbf J_f + \mathbf J_b = \mathbf J_f + \nabla \times \mathbf M \implies \nabla \times \left(\frac 1 {\mu_0} \mathbf B - \mathbf M\right) = \mathbf J_f \implies \nabla \times \mathbf H = \mathbf J_f \,,$$ where $\mathbf H$ is the magnetizing field. \(Maxwell's correction is ignored here.\) <!--SR:!2025-10-23,147,432!2025-07-19,80,392-->
  - magnetization / magnetostatics ::@:: In the absence of free electric currents and time-dependent effects, [Maxwell's equations](../../../../general/Maxwell's%20equations.md) describing the magnetic quantities reduce to $${\begin{aligned}\mathbf {\nabla \times H} &=\mathbf {0} \\\mathbf {\nabla \cdot H} &=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf {M} \end{aligned} }$$ These equations can be solved in analogy with [electrostatic](../../../../general/electrostatic.md) problems where $${\begin{aligned}\mathbf {\nabla \times E} &=\mathbf {0} \\\mathbf {\nabla \cdot E} &={\frac {\rho }{\epsilon _{0} } }\end{aligned} }$$ In this sense −∇⋅<!-- markdown separator -->__M__ plays the role of a fictitious "magnetic charge density" analogous to the [electric charge density](../../../../general/electric%20charge%20density.md) _ρ_; \(see also [demagnetizing field](../../../../general/demagnetizing%20field.md)\). <!--SR:!2025-07-20,81,392!2025-07-26,79,392-->
- magnetic field
  - magnetic field / H-field ::@:: The magnetic __H__ field is defined: $$\mathbf {H} \equiv {\frac {1}{\mu _{0} } }\mathbf {B} -\mathbf {M}$$ where $\mu _{0}$ is the [vacuum permeability](../../../../general/vacuum%20permeability.md), and __M__ is the [magnetization vector](../../../../general/magnetization.md). <!--SR:!2025-10-22,146,432!2025-10-20,144,433-->
    - magnetic field / H-field / sign ::@:: Compare with $\mathbf D = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf E + \mathbf P$. One would find the sign of the second term reversed. This is because $\mathbf E$ points from positive to negative but $\mathbf P$ points from negative to positive, while both $\mathbf B$ and $\mathbf M$ point from south to north \(as dipole\). \(This is very cursed...\) <!--SR:!2025-10-19,143,433!2025-11-02,157,432-->
- [magnetic susceptibility](../../../../general/magnetic%20susceptibility.md) ::@:: It is a measure of how much a material will become magnetized in an applied magnetic field. It is the ratio of magnetization __M__ (magnetic moment per unit volume) to the applied magnetic field intensity __H__. <!--SR:!2025-08-28,112,412!2025-07-29,82,393-->
  - magnetic susceptibility / sign ::@:: This allows a simple classification, into two categories, of most materials' responses to an applied magnetic field: an alignment with the magnetic field, _χ_ > 0, called _paramagnetism_, or an alignment against the field, _χ_ < 0, called _diamagnetism_. <!--SR:!2025-11-04,159,433!2025-08-26,110,412-->
  - magnetic susceptibility / values ::@:: Typical values are around −10<sup>–5</sup>. Superconductors are perfect diamagnetics with _χ_<sub>_m_</sub> = −1. <!--SR:!2025-11-04,159,433!2025-11-04,159,432-->
  - magnetic susceptibility / relative permeability ::@:: The below assumes linear material. <p> Using [SI units](../../../../general/SI%20electromagnetism%20units.md), the [magnetic induction](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md) __B__ is related to __H__ by the relationship $$\mathbf {B} =\mu _{0}(\mathbf {H} +\mathbf {M} )\ {\stackrel {\text{linear} }{=} }\ \mu _{0}(1+\chi _{\text{v} })\mathbf {H} =\mu \mathbf {H} ,$$ where _μ_<sub>0</sub> is the [vacuum permeability](../../../../general/vacuum%20permeability.md) \(see table of [physical constants](../../../../general/physical%20constant.md)\), and \(1 + _χ_<sub>v</sub>\) is the [relative permeability](../../../../general/permeability%20(electromagnetism).md#relative%20permeability%20and%20magnetic%20susceptibility) of the material. Thus the _volume magnetic susceptibility_ _χ_<sub>v</sub> and the [magnetic permeability](../../../../general/magnetic%20permeability.md) _μ_ are related by the following formula: $$\mu \ {\stackrel {\text{def} }{=} }\ \mu _{0}(1+\chi _{\text{v} }).$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-28,81,393!2025-07-26,79,392-->

## week 8 lecture 2

- datetime: 2025-03-26T09:00:00+08:00/2025-03-26T10:20:00+08:00
- topic: electrodynamics, Faraday's law, Lenz's law
- [Faraday's law of induction](../../../../general/Faraday's%20law%20of%20induction.md) ::@:: It is a law of electromagnetism predicting how a magnetic field will interact with an electric circuit to produce an electromotive force \(emf\). <!--SR:!2025-07-27,80,393!2025-10-22,146,433-->
  - Faraday's law of induction / motivation ::@:: Consider a rectangular loop, with one side in a uniform magnetic field. When we pull the rectangular loop out from the magnetic field, charges in the loop should experience Lorentz force. The emf generated is: $$\mathcal E = \frac W q = \frac {qvB \cdot l} q = vBl \,,$$ where $l$ is the length of that side of the rectangular loop. <p> Conveniently, this is also the decrease of the magnetic flux through the rectangular loop. So we have: $$\mathcal E = -\frac {\mathrm d \Phi_B} {\mathrm dt} \,.$$ In fact, this equation applies very generally to any loops, even changing loops \(assuming the velocity of the abstract curve ∂Σ matches the actual velocity of the material conducting the electricity\). <p> \(We also note that Lorentz force should not do any work, so where does the work come from? It turns out moving the loop provides the work.\) <!--SR:!2025-07-27,80,393!2025-07-01,62,372-->
  - Faraday's law of induction / mathematical statement ::@:: Faraday's law states that the emf is also given by the [rate of change](../../../../general/time%20derivative.md) of the magnetic flux: $${\mathcal {E} }=-{\frac {\mathrm {d} \Phi _{B} }{\mathrm {d} t} },$$ where ${\mathcal {E} }$ is the [electromotive force](../../../../general/electromotive%20force.md) \(emf\) and Φ<sub>_B_</sub> is the [magnetic flux](../../../../general/magnetic%20flux.md). <p> The direction of the electromotive force is given by [Lenz's law](../../../../general/Lenz's%20law.md). <!--SR:!2025-10-28,152,432!2025-11-02,157,432-->
    - Faraday's law of induction / mathematical statement / coil ::@:: For a tightly wound [coil of wire](../../../../general/inductor.md), composed of _N_ identical turns, each with the same Φ<sub>_B_</sub>, Faraday's law of induction states that $${\mathcal {E} }=-N{\frac {\mathrm {d} \Phi _{B} }{\mathrm {d} t} }$$ where _N_ is the number of turns of wire and Φ<sub>_B_</sub> is the magnetic flux through a single loop. <!--SR:!2025-11-03,158,433!2025-11-05,160,432-->
- [electromagnetic induction](../../../../general/electromagnetic%20induction.md) ::@:: It is the production of an electromotive force (emf) across an electrical conductor in a changing magnetic field. <!--SR:!2025-10-24,148,433!2025-11-06,161,433-->
  - electromagnetic induction / experiment ::@:: You have a coil of wire connected to an ammeter. When you move an magnet/electromagnet nearby, it generates current. Moving faster increases the current. Moving in the opposite direction reverses the current. Changing the electromagnet strength generates current as well. <p> To summarize, change in magnetic field through the coil of wire induces electric current. <!--SR:!2025-11-03,158,433!2025-11-06,161,433-->
- Faraday's law of induction
  - Faraday's law of induction / Maxwell–Faraday equation ::@:: It is $$\nabla \times \mathbf {E} =-{\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t} }$$ \(in [SI units](../../../../general/SI%20units.md)\) where ∇ × is the [curl](../../../../general/curl%20(mathematics).md) [operator](../../../../general/linear%20operator.md) and again __E__\(__r__, _t_\) is the [electric field](../../../../general/electric%20field.md) and __B__\(__r__, _t_\) is the [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md). These fields can generally be functions of position __r__ and time _t_. <p> It can be considered as the differential form of Faraday's law, by Stokes' theorem. This is also one of the four Maxwell's equations. <!--SR:!2025-10-25,149,433!2025-09-01,116,413-->
- [Lenz's law](../../../../general/Lenz's%20law.md) ::@:: It states that the direction of the electric current induced in a conductor by a changing magnetic field is such that the magnetic field created by the induced current opposes changes in the initial magnetic field. <!--SR:!2025-08-27,111,412!2025-10-28,152,432-->
  - Lenz's law / intuition ::@:: We can think of the electrical loop liking to maintain a constant flux through itself. It does not succeed completely, as the flux produced is typically a tiny fraction of the change in magnetic field. <!--SR:!2025-11-06,161,433!2025-10-20,144,433-->
- Faraday's law of induction
  - Faraday's law of induction / pure Faraday field ::@:: We now know that $\nabla \times \mathbf E = -\frac {\partial \mathbf B} {\partial t}$. A pure Faraday field is an electric field that is generated purely by changes in magnetic field. That is, it satisfies the above, and it has no electric charge density, thus $\nabla \cdot \mathbf E = 0$. <p> In this case, we observe such an electric field is completely analogous to the magnetic field, but with $-\frac {\partial \mathbf B} {\partial t}$ replacing $\mu_0 \mathbf J$. <p> We can obtain $$\oint \mathbf E \cdot \,\mathrm d\mathbf \ell = -\frac {\mathrm d\Phi_B} {\mathrm dt} \,,$$ similar to $$\oint \mathbf B \cdot \,\mathrm d\mathbf \ell = \mu_0 I_{\text{enc} } \,.$$ We see this induced electric field is responsible for inducing the electric current in the loop. Indeed, it performs work of $\mathcal E = -\frac {\mathrm d\Phi_B} {\mathrm dt}$ per unit charge when moving charges once around the loop. <!--SR:!2025-07-02,63,372!2025-06-30,61,373-->

  - Maxwell's equations / symmetry ::@:: If we assume magnetic monopoles exist, then we have a more symmetric set of equations \(Weber convention\): $$\begin{aligned} \nabla \cdot \mathbf E & = \frac {\rho_e} {\varepsilon_0} \\ \nabla \cdot \mathbf B & = \mu_0 \rho_m \\ \nabla \times \mathbf E & = -\mu_0 \mathbf j_m - \frac {\partial \mathbf B} {\partial t} \\ \nabla \times \mathbf B & = \mu_0 \mathbf j_e + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac {\partial \mathbf E} {\partial t} = \mu_0 \mathbf j_e + \frac 1 {c^2} \frac {\partial \mathbf E} {\partial t} \,, \end{aligned}$$ with the Lorentz force equation becoming: $$\mathbf F = q_e (\mathbf E + \mathbf v \times \mathbf B) + q_m \left(\mathbf B - \mathbf v \times \frac {\mathbf E} {c^2} \right)\,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-08-14,60,388!2025-08-30,65,390-->
- Ampère's circuital law
  - Ampère's circuital law / Maxwell's correction ::@:: The original equation is simply: $$\nabla \times \mathbf B = \mu_0 \mathbf J \,.$$ Taking its divergence, we expect it to be zero: $$\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf B) = \mu_0 (\nabla \cdot \mathbf J) \overset ? = 0 \,.$$ But the divergence of current density is not necessarily zero. So we correct for it by subtracting the divergence of current density: $$\mu_0 (\nabla \cdot \mathbf J) = -\mu_0 \frac {\partial \rho} {\partial t} = -\mu_0 \varepsilon_0\frac {\partial} {\partial t} \nabla \cdot \mathbf E = \nabla \cdot \left(-\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac {\partial \mathbf E} {\partial t} \right) \,.$$ Finally, we have: $$\nabla \times \mathbf B = \mu_0 \left(\mathbf J + \varepsilon_0 \frac {\partial \mathbf E} {\partial t} \right) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-08-18,81,400!2025-09-19,113,421-->
    - Ampère's circuital law / Maxwell's correction / intuition ::@:: Consider a capacitor releasing current along a wire. Consider a loop surrouding the wire.

Applying the uncorrected law to a balloon surface enclosed by the same loop and evades the electric source and the wire, i.e. in between the capacitor plates, yields a zero value. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,164,441!2025-11-05,160,440-->
- [displacement current](../../../../general/displacement%20current.md) ::@:: It is the quantity ∂<!-- markdown separator -->__D__/∂<!-- markdown separator -->_t_ appearing in [Maxwell's equations](../../../../general/Maxwell's%20equations.md) that is defined in terms of the rate of change of __D__, the [electric displacement field](../../../../general/electric%20displacement%20field.md). <!--SR:!2025-11-06,161,441!2025-10-29,153,440-->
  - displacement current / interpretation ::@:: Displacement current density has the same units as electric current density, and it is a source of the [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md) just as actual current is. However it is not an electric current of moving [charges](../../../../general/electric%20charge.md), but a time-varying [electric field](../../../../general/electric%20field.md). In physical materials \(as opposed to vacuum\), there is also a contribution from the slight motion of charges bound in atoms, called [dielectric polarization](../../../../general/dielectric%20polarization.md#dielectric%20polarisation). <!--SR:!2025-11-07,162,441!2025-11-07,162,440-->
  - displacement current / equation ::@:: Differentiating the electric displacement field with respect to time defines the _displacement current density_, which therefore has two components in a [dielectric](../../../../general/dielectric.md): $$\mathbf {J} _{\mathrm {D} }=\varepsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {E} }{\partial t} }+{\frac {\partial \mathbf {P} }{\partial t} }\,.$$ The first term on the right hand side is present in material media and in free space. It doesn't necessarily come from any actual movement of charge, but it does have an associated magnetic field, just as a current does due to charge motion. Some authors apply the name _displacement current_ to the first term by itself. \(__this course__: The name _displacement current_ is used this way during introduction.\) <!--SR:!2025-11-02,157,440!2025-10-30,154,440-->
  - displacement current / polarization current density ::@:: The second term on the right hand side, called polarization current density, comes from the change in [polarization](../../../../general/electric%20polarization.md) of the individual molecules of the dielectric material. A changing state of polarization corresponds to charge movement and so is equivalent to a current, hence the term "polarization current". Thus, $$I_{\mathrm {D} }=\iint _{S}\mathbf {J} _{\mathrm {D} }\cdot \operatorname {d} \!\mathbf {S} =\iint _{S}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {D} }{\partial t} }\cdot \operatorname {d} \!\mathbf {S} ={\frac {\partial }{\partial t} }\iint _{S}\mathbf {D} \cdot \operatorname {d} \!\mathbf {S} ={\frac {\partial \Phi _{\mathrm {D} } }{\partial t} }\,.$$ This polarization is the displacement current as it was originally conceived by Maxwell. <!--SR:!2025-09-24,118,421!2025-07-05,58,380-->
    - displacement current / polarization current density / magnetizing field ::@:: Remember when we derive the magnetizing field, we considered the curl of the magnetization field $\nabla \times \mathbf M$ and ignored the bound surface current: $\mathbf M \times \hat{\mathbf n}$, where $\hat{\mathbf n}$ is the surface outward normal. It turns out this bound surface current can be identified with the displacement current: $\frac {\partial \mathbf P} {\partial t}$. <p> Now we derive, considering it: $$\begin{aligned} \nabla \times \left(\frac 1 {\mu_0} \mathbf B\right) & = \mathbf J + \varepsilon_0 \frac {\partial \mathbf E} {\partial t} \\ & = \mathbf J_f + \nabla \times \mathbf M + \mathbf M \times \hat{\mathbf n} + \varepsilon_0 \frac {\partial \mathbf E} {\partial t} \\ & = \mathbf J_f + \nabla \times \mathbf M + \frac {\partial \mathbf P} {\partial t} + \varepsilon_0 \frac {\partial \mathbf E} {\partial t} \\ & = \mathbf J_f + \nabla \times \mathbf M + \frac {\partial \mathbf D} {\partial t} \\ \nabla \times \left(\frac 1 \mu_0 \mathbf B - \mathbf M \right) & = \mathbf J_f + \frac {\partial \mathbf D} {\partial t} \\ \nabla \times \mathbf H & = \mathbf J_f + \frac {\partial \mathbf D} {\partial t} \,. \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-09-26,120,421!2025-09-28,122,421-->
  - displacement current / wave propagation ::@:: It leads to electricmagnetic wave propagation. Assuming no free and bound current, we have the displacement current: $$\mathbf J_D = \varepsilon_0 \frac {\partial \mathbf E} {\partial t} \,.$$ Some manipulation leads to a wave equation for the magnetic field: $$\frac {\partial^2 \mathbf B} {\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 \mathbf B \,,$$ and for the electric field: $$\frac {\partial^2 \mathbf E} {\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 \mathbf E \,,$$ where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. <!--SR:!2025-10-31,155,440!2025-11-08,163,440-->

  - Maxwell's equations / Lorentz force law ::@:: It, along with Maxwell's equations summarize, classical electrodynamics. <p> It states that a particle of charge _q_ moving with a velocity __v__ in an [electric field](../../../../general/electric%20field.md) __E__ and a [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md) __B__ experiences a force \(in [SI units](../../../../general/International%20System%20of%20Units.md) of $$\mathbf {F} =q\left(\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} \right).$$ <!--SR:!2025-10-25,149,440!2025-10-30,154,440-->

- topic: magnetic inductance, energy of the magnetic field
- [solenoid](../../../../general/solenoid.md) ::@:: It is a type of electromagnet formed by a helical coil of wire whose length is substantially greater than its diameter, which generates a controlled magnetic field. The coil can produce a uniform magnetic field in a volume of space when an electric current is passed through it. <!--SR:!2025-11-05,160,441!2025-11-01,156,441-->
  - solenoid / infinite continuous solenoid ::@:: We get $$B=\mu _{0}{\frac {NI}{l} } \,.$$ This equation is valid for a solenoid in free space, which means the [permeability](../../../../general/permeability%20(electromagnetism).md) of the magnetic path is the same as permeability of free space, μ<sub>0</sub>. <p> The inclusion of a [ferromagnetic](../../../../general/ferromagnetic.md) core, such as [iron](../../../../general/iron.md), increases the magnitude of the magnetic flux density in the solenoid and raises the effective permeability of the magnetic path. This is expressed by the formula $$B=\mu _{0}\mu _{\mathrm {eff} }{\frac {NI}{l} }=\mu {\frac {NI}{l} },$$ where _μ_<sub>eff</sub> is the effective or apparent permeability of the core. <!--SR:!2025-11-03,158,441!2025-11-06,161,440-->
    - solenoid / infinite continuous solenoid / derivation ::@:: Applying [Ampère's circuital law](../../../../general/Ampère's%20circuital%20law.md) to the solenoid \(see figure below\) gives us $$Bl=\mu _{0}NI,$$ where $B$ is the [magnetic flux density](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md), $l$ is the length of the solenoid, $\mu _{0}$ is the [magnetic constant](../../../../general/magnetic%20constant.md), $N$ the number of turns, and $I$ the current. <p> ![How [Ampère's law](../../../../general/Ampère's%20circuital%20law.md) can be applied to the solenoid](../../../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Solenoid%20and%20Ampere%20Law%20-%202.png) <!--SR:!2025-11-08,163,440!2025-09-19,113,420-->
    - solenoid / infinite continuous solenoid / inductance ::@:: Since $B = \mu_0 NI / l$, this implies a _flux linkage_ of: $\Psi = \mu_0 N^2 I A / l$. Using the definition of inductance, we have: $$L = \frac {\Psi} I = \mu_0 \frac {N^2 A} l \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-10-07,104,410!2025-07-02,28,410-->
- [flux linkage](../../../../general/flux%20linkage.md) ::@:: It is used to define the interaction of a multi-turn inductor with the magnetic flux as described by the Faraday's law of induction. <!--SR:!2025-11-08,163,440!2025-11-09,164,441-->
  - flux linkage / simplification ::@:: Since the contributions of all turns in the coil add up, in the over-simplified situation of the same flux $\Phi$ passing through all the turns, the flux linkage \(also known as _flux linked_\) is $\Psi =n\Phi$, where $n$ is the number of turns. <!--SR:!2025-10-30,154,440!2025-11-07,162,441-->
- [inductance](../../../../general/inductance.md) ::@:: It is the tendency of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in the electric current flowing through it. <!--SR:!2025-11-04,159,440!2025-11-08,163,441-->
  - inductance / mechanism ::@:: The electric current produces a [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md) around the conductor. The magnetic field strength depends on the magnitude of the electric current, and therefore follows any changes in the magnitude of the current. From [Faraday's law of induction](../../../../general/Faraday's%20law%20of%20induction.md), any change in magnetic field through a circuit induces an [electromotive force](../../../../general/electromotive%20force.md) \(EMF\) \([voltage](../../../../general/voltage.md)\) in the conductors, a process known as [electromagnetic induction](../../../../general/electromagnetic%20induction.md). This induced voltage created by the changing current has the effect of opposing the change in current. This is stated by [Lenz's law](../../../../general/Lenz's%20law.md), and the voltage is called _[back EMF](../../../../general/back%20EMF.md)_. <!--SR:!2025-09-18,112,420!2025-11-01,156,441-->
  - inductance / analogy ::@:: Capacitance as to capacitors is analogous to inductance as to inductors. These two quantities both are determined solely by the geometry of the inductor. <!--SR:!2025-11-01,156,440!2025-11-07,162,440-->
  - inductance / SI unit ::@:: It is the [henry](../../../../general/henry%20(unit).md) \(H\), which is the amount of inductance that causes a voltage of one [volt](../../../../general/volt.md), when the current is changing at a rate of one [ampere](../../../../general/ampere%20(unit).md) per second. <!--SR:!2025-09-20,114,421!2025-08-20,83,401-->
  - inductance / two wire loops ::@:: The mutual inductance by a filamentary circuit $m$ on a filamentary circuit $n$ is given by the double integral _[Neumann](Franz%20Ernst%20Neumann.md) formula_ $$L_{m,n}={\frac {\mu _{0} }{4\pi } }\oint _{C_{m} }\oint _{C_{n} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {x} _{m}\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {x} _{n} }{\ \left|\mathbf {x} _{m}-\mathbf {x} _{n}\right|\ } }\ ,$$ where <p> - $C_{m}$ and $C_{n}$ are the curves followed by the wires. <br/> - $\mu _{0}$ is the [permeability of free space](../../../../general/permeability%20of%20free%20space.md) \(4<!-- markdown separator -->_π_<!-- markdown separator -->×10<sup>−7</sup> H/m\) <br/> - $\mathrm {d} \mathbf {x} _{m}$ is a small increment of the wire in circuit _C_<sub>m</sub> <br/> - $\mathbf {x} _{m}$ is the position of $\mathrm {d} \mathbf {x} _{m}$ in space <br/> - $\mathrm {d} \mathbf {x} _{n}$ is a small increment of the wire in circuit _C_<sub>n</sub> <br/> - $\mathbf {x} _{n}$ is the position of $\mathrm {d} \mathbf {x} _{n}$ in space. <!--SR:!2025-11-05,160,440!2025-07-06,59,381-->
    - inductance / two wire loops / derivation ::@:: $$M_{ij}\mathrel {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=} } {\frac {\Phi _{ij} }{I_{j} } }$$ where <p> - $I_{j}$ is the current through the $j$ th wire, this current creates the magnetic flux $\Phi _{ij}\ \,$ through the $i$ th surface <br/> - $\Phi _{ij}$ is the [magnetic flux](../../../../general/magnetic%20flux.md) through the _i_<!-- markdown separator -->th surface due to the [electrical circuit](../../../../general/electrical%20circuit.md) outlined by $C_{j}$: $$\Phi _{ij}=\int _{S_{i} }\mathbf {B} _{j}\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {a} =\int _{S_{i} }(\nabla \times \mathbf {A_{j} } )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {a} =\oint _{C_{i} }\mathbf {A} _{j}\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {s} _{i}=\oint _{C_{i} }\left({\frac {\mu _{0}I_{j} }{4\pi } }\oint _{C_{j} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {s} _{j} }{\left|\mathbf {s} _{i}-\mathbf {s} _{j}\right|} }\right)\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {s} _{i}$$ where <p> - $C_{i}$ is the curve enclosing surface $S_{i}$; and $S_{i}$ is any arbitrary orientable area with edge $C_{i}$ <br/> - $\mathbf {B} _{j}$ is the [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md) vector due to the $j$-th current \(of circuit $C_{j}$\). <br/> - $\mathbf {A} _{j}$ is the [vector potential](../../../../general/vector%20potential.md) due to the $j$-th current. <!--SR:!2025-07-11,64,381!2025-09-26,120,421-->
    - inductance / two wire loops / interpretation ::@:: We see the above expression is symmetric: It does not matter which loop has the current going through. We also see inductance only depends on the geometry of the two wires. We can consider these two wires as an _mutual inductor_ \(this ignores the self-inductance of the two wires\). <p> We also see why _mutual inductance_ is the emf induced in one coil \(secondary\) per unit time rate of change of current in the neighboring coil \(primary\): $$\mathcal E_2 = -M \frac {\partial i_1} {\partial t} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-11-06,161,441!2025-09-27,121,420-->
  - inductance / mutual inductance ::@:: It is the emf induced in one coil \(secondary\) per unit time rate of change of current in the neighboring coil \(primary\): $$\mathcal E_2 = -M \frac {\partial i_1} {\partial t} \,.$$ <p> Integrating the above over time, and considering the initial condition where zero current implies zero magnetic flux, we have an equivalent definition: It is the flux linkage of one coil \(secondary\) per unit current in the neighboring coil \(primary\): $$\Phi_2 = -M i_1 \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-09-14,108,421!2025-09-21,115,420-->
    - inductance / mutual inductance / interpretation ::@:: The second definition gives an interpretation that an mutual inductor \(this ignores the self-inductance\) _stores_ magnetic flux proportional to the current running through it, and the proportionality constant is the mutual inductance \(this ignores the self-inductance\). <!--SR:!2025-11-05,160,440!2025-11-01,156,440-->
  - inductance / self inductance ::@:: The magnetic flux change also induces an emf in the source loop. Again, a quantity similar to mutual inductance can be defined: _self inductance_, or simply _inductance_. Its definition is also very similar: the _back emf_ induced per unit time rate of change of current: $$\mathcal E = -L \frac {\partial I} {\partial t} \,,$$ or equivalently, flux through the loop per unit current: $$\Phi_B = -LI \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-11-04,159,441!2025-11-03,158,441-->
    - inductance / self inductance / interpretation ::@:: The second definition gives an interpretation that an inductor _stores_ magnetic flux proportional to the current running through it, and the proportionality constant is the inductance. <p> Since the current fight against the emf, the used energy is stored in the stored magnetic flux, and is recoverable when you stop the current. So an inductor also _stores_ energy in its magnetic field. <!--SR:!2025-11-07,162,440!2025-10-30,154,440-->
    - inductance / self inductance / energy ::@:: The [energy](../../../../general/energy.md) $U$ \(measured in [joules](../../../../general/joule.md), in [SI](../../../../general/SI.md)\) stored by an inductance with a current $I$ through it is equal to the amount of work required to establish the current through the inductance from zero, and therefore the magnetic field. This is given by: $$U=\int _{0}^{I}L(i)\,i\,{\text{d} }i\,$$ If the inductance $L(i)$ is constant over the current range, the stored energy is $${\begin{aligned}U&=L\int _{0}^{I}\,i\,{\text{d} }i\\[3pt]&={\tfrac {1}{2} }L\,I^{2}\end{aligned} }$$ Inductance is therefore also proportional to the energy stored in the magnetic field for a given current. This energy is stored as long as the current remains constant. <!--SR:!2025-09-15,109,421!2025-11-08,163,440-->
- magnetic field
  - magnetic field / stored energy ::@:: Energy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non-dispersive materials, this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that the energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field. <!--SR:!2025-10-31,155,441!2025-11-08,163,441-->
- [magnetic energy](../../../../general/magnetic%20energy.md) ::@:: There are different ways to define the magnetic energy in different situations: magnetic dipole in a magnetic field, inductor, magnetic field, magnetostatic system of currents, etc. <!--SR:!2025-11-03,158,441!2025-11-06,161,440-->
  - magnetic energy / magnetic dipole in a magnetic field ::@:: It of a [magnet](../../../../general/magnet.md) or [magnetic moment](../../../../general/magnetic%20moment.md) $\mathbf {m}$ in a [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md) $\mathbf {B}$ is defined as the [mechanical work](../../../../general/mechanical%20work.md) of the magnetic force on the re-alignment of the vector of the [magnetic dipole moment](../../../../general/magnetic%20dipole%20moment.md) and is equal to: $$E_{\text{p,m} }=-\mathbf {m} \cdot \mathbf {B}$$ The mechanical work takes the form of a torque ${\boldsymbol {N} }$: $$\mathbf {N} =\mathbf {m} \times \mathbf {B} =-\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {\nabla } E_{\text{p,m} }$$ which will act to "realign" the magnetic dipole with the magnetic field. <!--SR:!2025-09-16,110,420!2025-07-09,41,380-->
  - magnetic energy / inductor ::@:: In an [electronic circuit](../../../../general/electronic%20circuit.md) the energy stored in an [inductor](../../../../general/inductor.md) \(of [inductance](../../../../general/inductance.md) $L$\) when a current $I$ flows through it is given by: $$E_{\text{p,m} }={\frac {1}{2} }LI^{2}.$$ This expression forms the basis for superconducting magnetic energy storage. It can be derived from a time average of the product of current and voltage across an inductor. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,164,441!2025-11-02,157,440-->
    - magnetic energy / inductor / analogy ::@:: Compare the energy of an inductor with the energy of a capacitor: $$\begin{aligned} E & = \frac 1 2 LI^2 \\ E & = \frac 1 2 CV^2 \,. \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-12-05,162,448!2025-06-27,29,430-->
  - magnetic energy / magnetic field ::@:: Energy is also stored in a magnetic field itself. The energy per unit volume $u$ in a region of free space with [vacuum permeability](../../../../general/vacuum%20permeability.md) $\mu _{0}$ containing magnetic field $\mathbf {B}$ is: $$u={\frac {1}{2} }{\frac {B^{2} }{\mu _{0} } } \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-11-03,158,441!2025-11-09,164,441-->
    - magnetic energy / magnetic field / linear ::@:: More generally, if we assume that the medium is [paramagnetic](../../../../general/paramagnetism.md) or [diamagnetic](../../../../general/diamagnetism.md) so that a linear constitutive equation exists that relates $\mathbf {B}$ and the [magnetization](../../../../general/magnetization.md) $\mathbf {H}$ \(for example $\mathbf {H} =\mathbf {B} /\mu$ where $\mu$ is the [magnetic permeability](../../../../general/permeability%20(electromagnetism).md) of the material\), then it can be shown that the magnetic field stores an energy of $$E={\frac {1}{2} }\int \mathbf {H} \cdot \mathbf {B} \,\mathrm {d} V$$ where the integral is evaluated over the entire region where the magnetic field exists. <p> Alternative equations: $$u = \frac {\mathbf B \cdot \mathbf H} {2} = \frac {\mathbf B \cdot \mathbf B} {2\mu} = \frac {\mu \mathbf H \cdot \mathbf H} 2 \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-10-25,149,441!2025-09-22,116,421-->
    - magnetic energy / magnetic field / derivation ::@:: Start with the equation from a magnetostatic system of currents: $$\begin{aligned} u & = \frac 1 2 \int \! \mathbf J \cdot \mathbf A \,\mathrm dV \\ & = \frac 1 {2\mu_0} \int \!

    - magnetic energy / magnetic field / usage ::@:: Using symmetry, we can calculate the magnetic energy in the magnetic field of an _inductor_. Then we apply $u = \frac 1 2 L I^2$ to calculate its _inductance_. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,164,441!2025-11-03,158,441-->
  - magnetic energy / magnetostatic system of currents ::@:: For a [magnetostatic](../../../../general/magnetostatic.md) system of currents in free space, the stored energy can be found by imagining the process of linearly turning on the currents and their generated magnetic field, arriving at a total energy of: $$E={\frac {1}{2} }\int \mathbf {J} \cdot \mathbf {A} \,\mathrm {d} V$$ where $\mathbf {J}$ is the current density field and $\mathbf {A}$ is the [magnetic vector potential](../../../../general/magnetic%20vector%20potential.md). This is analogous to the [electrostatic energy](../../../../general/electrostatic%20energy.md) expression ${\frac {1}{2} }\int \rho \phi \,\mathrm {d} V$; note that neither of these static expressions apply in the case of time-varying charge or current distributions. <!--SR:!2025-09-23,117,421!2025-07-04,36,381-->

Multipole expansions are useful because, similar to [Taylor series](../../../../general/Taylor%20series.md), oftentimes only the first few terms are needed to provide a good approximation of the original function. The function being expanded may be [real](../../../../general/real%20number.md)- or [complex](../../../../general/complex%20number.md)-valued and is defined either on $\mathbb {R} ^{3}$, or less often on $\mathbb {R} ^{n}$ for some other $n$. <!--SR:!2025-11-07,162,441!2025-11-07,162,440-->

- LC circuit
  - LC circuit / operation ::@:: If an inductor is connected across a charged capacitor, the voltage across the capacitor will drive a current through the inductor, building up a magnetic field around it. The voltage across the capacitor falls to zero as the charge is used up by the current flow. At this point, the energy stored in the coil's magnetic field induces a voltage across the coil, because inductors oppose changes in current. This induced voltage causes a current to begin to recharge the capacitor with a voltage of opposite polarity to its original charge. Due to Faraday's law, the EMF which drives the current is caused by a decrease in the magnetic field, thus the energy required to charge the capacitor is extracted from the magnetic field. When the magnetic field is completely dissipated the current will stop and the charge will again be stored in the capacitor, with the opposite polarity as before. Then the cycle will begin again, with the current flowing in the opposite direction through the inductor. <!--SR:!2025-12-05,162,448!2025-11-30,157,448-->

    - LC circuit / time domain solution / Kirchhoff's laws ::@:: By [Kirchhoff's voltage law](../../../../general/Kirchhoff's%20voltage%20law.md#Kirchhoff's%20voltage%20law), the voltage _V<sub>C</sub>_ across the capacitor plus the voltage _V<sub>L</sub>_ across the inductor must equal zero: $$V_{C}+V_{L}=0.$$ Likewise, by [Kirchhoff's current law](../../../../general/Kirchhoff's%20current%20law.md#Kirchhoff's%20current%20law%20(KCL)), the current through the capacitor equals the current through the inductor: $$I_{C}=I_{L}.$$ From the constitutive relations for the circuit elements, we also know that $${\begin{aligned}V_{L}(t)&=L{\frac {\mathrm {d} I_{L} }{\mathrm {d} t} },\\I_{C}(t)&=C{\frac {\mathrm {d} V_{C} }{\mathrm {d} t} }.\end{aligned} }$$ \(annotation: Note that voltages above are voltage _drops_.\) <!--SR:!2025-12-06,163,450!2025-09-27,93,410-->
    - LC circuit / time domain solution / differential equation ::@:: Rearranging and substituting gives the second order [differential equation](../../../../general/differential%20equation.md) $${\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2} }{\mathrm {d} t^{2} } }I(t)+{\frac {1}{LC} }I(t)=0.$$ The parameter _ω_<sub>0</sub>, the resonant [angular frequency](../../../../general/angular%20frequency.md), is defined as $$\omega _{0}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {LC} } }.$$ Using this can simplify the differential equation: $${\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2} }{\mathrm {d} t^{2} } }I(t)+\omega _{0}^{2}I(t)=0.$$ The associated [Laplace transform](../../../../general/Laplace%20transform.md) is $$s^{2}+\omega _{0}^{2}=0,$$ thus $$s=\pm j\omega _{0},$$ where _j_ is the [imaginary unit](../../../../general/imaginary%20unit.md). <!--SR:!2025-10-29,125,430!2025-11-27,154,448-->
    - LC circuit / time domain solution / solution ::@:: Thus, the complete solution to the differential equation is $$I(t)=Ae^{+j\omega _{0}t}+Be^{-j\omega _{0}t}$$ and can be solved for _A_ and _B_ by considering the initial conditions. Since the exponential is [complex](../../../../general/complex%20numbers.md), the solution represents a sinusoidal [alternating current](../../../../general/alternating%20current.md). Since the electric current _I_ is a physical quantity, it must be real-valued. As a result, it can be shown that the constants _A_ and _B_ must be [complex conjugates](../../../../general/complex%20conjugate.md): $$A=B^{*}.$$ Now let $$A={\frac {I_{0} }{2} }e^{+j\phi }.$$ Therefore, $$B={\frac {I_{0} }{2} }e^{-j\phi }.$$ Next, we can use [Euler's formula](../../../../general/Euler's%20formula.md) to obtain a real [sinusoid](../../../../general/sine%20wave.md) with [amplitude](../../../../general/amplitude.md) _I_<sub>0</sub>, [angular frequency](../../../../general/angular%20frequency.md) _ω_<sub>0</sub> = ⁠1/√\(_LC_\)⁠, and [phase angle](../../../../general/phase%20(waves).md) $\phi$. Thus, the resulting solution becomes $$I(t)=I_{0}\cos \left(\omega _{0}t+\phi \right),$$ <br/> $$V_{L}(t)=L{\frac {\mathrm {d} I}{\mathrm {d} t} }=-\omega _{0}LI_{0}\sin \left(\omega _{0}t+\phi \right).$$ <!--SR:!2025-09-26,92,410!2025-08-28,64,390-->

  - LC circuit / energy ::@:: An LC circuit, oscillating at its natural resonant frequency, can store electrical energy. <!-- See the animation. --> A capacitor stores energy in the electric field \ (_E_\) between its plates, depending on the voltage across it, and an inductor stores energy in its magnetic field \(_B_\), depending on the current through it. <p> The charge flows back and forth between the plates of the capacitor, through the inductor. The energy oscillates back and forth between the capacitor and the inductor until \(if not replenished from an external circuit\) internal resistance makes the oscillations die out. <!--SR:!2025-10-25,122,430!2025-10-17,114,430-->
  - LC circuit / assumptions ::@:: An LC circuit is an idealized model since it assumes there is no dissipation of energy due to resistance. Any practical implementation of an LC circuit will always include loss resulting from small but non-zero resistance within the components and connecting wires. <!--SR:!2025-11-29,156,450!2025-06-27,29,430-->

The name of the circuit is derived from the letters that are used to denote the constituent components of this circuit, where the sequence of the components may vary from RLC. <!--SR:!2025-12-08,165,450!2025-06-27,29,430-->
  - RLC circuit / series circuit ::@:: In this circuit, the three components are all in series with the voltage source. <p>  A time domain solution for the RLC circuit can be obtained using Kirchhoff's laws to form a differential equation, solve it, and plug in the initial conditions. <!--SR:!2025-12-09,166,450!2025-12-10,167,450-->

From the KVL, $$V_{\mathrm {R} }+V_{\mathrm {L} }+V_{\mathrm {C} }=V(t)\,,$$ where _V<sub>R</sub>_, _V_<sub>L</sub> and _V_<sub>C</sub> are the voltages \(annotation: _voltage drops_\) across _R_, _L_, and _C_, respectively, and _V_\(_t_\) is the time-varying voltage from the source. Substituting $V_{R}=R\ I(t)\,$, $\,V_{\mathrm {L} }=L{\frac {\mathrm {d} I(t)}{\mathrm {d} t} }\,$ and $\,V_{\mathrm {C} }=V(0)+{\frac {1}{\,C\,} }\int _{0}^{t}I(\tau )\,\mathrm {d} \tau \,$ into the equation above yields: $$RI(t)+L{\frac {\,\mathrm {d} I(t)\,}{\mathrm {d} t} }+V(0)+{\frac {1}{\,C\,} }\int _{0}^{t}I(\tau )\,\mathrm {d} \tau =V(t)\;.$$ <!--SR:!2025-09-24,90,410!2025-06-27,29,430-->
    - RLC circuit / series circuit / differential equation ::@:: For the case where the source is an unchanging voltage, taking the time derivative and dividing by _L_ leads to the following second order differential equation: $${\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2} }{\mathrm {d} t^{2} } }I(t)+{\frac {R}{\,L\,} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t} }I(t)+{\frac {1}{\,L\,C\,} }I(t)=0\;.$$ This can usefully be expressed in a more generally applicable form: $${\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2} }{\mathrm {d} t^{2} } }I(t)+2\alpha {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t} }I(t)+\omega _{0}^{2}I(t)=0\;.$$ _α_ and _ω_<sub>0</sub> are both in units of [angular frequency](../../../../general/angular%20frequency.md). _α_ is called the _neper frequency_, or _attenuation_, and is a measure of how fast the [transient response](../../../../general/transient%20response.md) of the circuit will die away after the stimulus has been removed. Neper occurs in the name because the units can also be considered to be [nepers](../../../../general/neper.md) per second, neper being a [logarithmic unit](../../../../general/logarithmic%20unit.md#logarithmic%20units) of attenuation. _ω_<sub>0</sub> is the angular resonance frequency. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,29,430!2025-06-27,29,430-->
    - RLC circuit / series circuit / parameters ::@:: _α_ and _ω_<sub>0</sub> are both in units of [angular frequency](../../../../general/angular%20frequency.md). _α_ is called the _neper frequency_, or _attenuation_, and is a measure of how fast the [transient response](../../../../general/transient%20response.md) of the circuit will die away after the stimulus has been removed. Neper occurs in the name because the units can also be considered to be [nepers](../../../../general/neper.md) per second, neper being a [logarithmic unit](../../../../general/logarithmic%20unit.md#logarithmic%20units) of attenuation. _ω_<sub>0</sub> is the angular resonance frequency. <p> For the case of the series RLC circuit these two parameters are given by: $${\begin{aligned}\alpha &={\frac {R}{\,2L\,} }\\\omega _{0}&={\frac {1}{\,{\sqrt {L\,C\,} }\,} }\;.\end{aligned} }$$ <p> A useful parameter is the _damping factor_, _ζ_, which is defined as the ratio of these two; although, sometimes _ζ_ is not used, and _α_ is referred to as _damping factor_ instead; hence requiring careful specification of one's use of that term. $$\zeta \equiv {\frac {\alpha }{\,\omega _{0}\,} }\;.$$ <p> In the case of the series RLC circuit, the damping factor is given by $$\zeta ={\frac {\,R\,}{2} }{\sqrt { {\frac {C}{\,L\,} }\,} }={\frac {1}{\ 2Q\ } }~.$$ The value of the damping factor determines the type of transient that the circuit will exhibit. <!--SR:!2025-09-10,76,390!2025-09-28,94,410-->
    - RLC circuit / series circuit / transient response ::@:: The differential equation has the [characteristic equation](../../../../general/linear%20homogeneous%20differential%20equation.md#homogeneous%20equation%20with%20constant%20coefficients), $$s^{2}+2\alpha s+\omega _{0}^{2}=0\,.$$ The roots of the equation in _s_-domain are, $${\begin{aligned}s_{1}&=-\alpha +{\sqrt {\alpha ^{2}-\omega _{0}^{2}\,} }=-\omega _{0}\left(\zeta -{\sqrt {\zeta ^{2}-1\,} }\right)={\frac {-\omega _{0} }{\ \zeta +{\sqrt {\zeta ^{2}-1\ } }\ } }\ ,\\s_{2}&=-\alpha -{\sqrt {\alpha ^{2}-\omega _{0}^{2}\,} }=-\omega _{0}\left(\zeta +{\sqrt {\zeta ^{2}-1\,} }\right)\;.\end{aligned} }$$ The general solution of the differential equation is an exponential in either root or a linear superposition of both, $$I(t)=A_{1}e^{s_{1}t}+A_{2}e^{s_{2}t}\;.$$ The coefficients _A_<sub>1</sub> and _A_<sub>2</sub> are determined by the [boundary conditions](../../../../general/boundary%20condition.md) of the specific problem being analysed. That is, they are set by the values of the currents and voltages in the circuit at the onset of the transient and the presumed value they will settle to after infinite time. <!--SR:!2025-09-02,68,390!2025-09-16,82,410-->
    - RLC circuit / series circuit / underdamped response ::@:: The underdamped response \(_ζ_ \< 1\) is $$I(t)=B_{1}e^{-\alpha t}\cos(\omega _{\mathrm {d} }t)+B_{2}e^{-\alpha t}\sin(\omega _{\mathrm {d} }t)\,.$$ By applying standard [trigonometric identities](../../../../general/list%20of%20trigonometric%20identities.md#linear%20combinations) the two trigonometric functions may be expressed as a single sinusoid with phase shift, $$I(t)=B_{3}e^{-\alpha t}\sin(\omega _{\mathrm {d} }t+\varphi )\;.$$ The underdamped response is a decaying oscillation at frequency _ω_<sub>d</sub>. The oscillation decays at a rate determined by the attenuation α. The exponential in α describes the [envelope](../../../../general/envelope%20(waves).md) of the oscillation. _B_<sub>1</sub> and _B_<sub>2</sub> \(or _B_<sub>3</sub> and the phase shift _φ_ in the second form\) are arbitrary constants determined by boundary conditions. The frequency _ω_<sub>d</sub> is given by $$\omega _{\mathrm {d} }={\sqrt {\omega _{0}^{2}-\alpha ^{2} } }=\omega _{0}{\sqrt {1-\zeta ^{2}\,} } = \sqrt{\frac 1 {LC} - \frac {R^2} {4L^2} } \;.$$ This is called the damped resonance frequency or the damped natural frequency. It is the frequency the circuit will naturally oscillate at if not driven by an external source. The resonance frequency, _ω_<sub>0</sub>, which is the frequency at which the circuit will resonate when driven by an external oscillation, may often be referred to as the undamped resonance frequency to distinguish it. <!--SR:!2025-07-03,7,348!2025-08-29,64,390-->
    - RLC circuit / series circuit / critically damped response ::@:: The critically damped response \(_ζ_ = 1\) is $$I(t)=D_{1}te^{-\alpha t}+D_{2}e^{-\alpha t}\;.$$ The critically damped response represents the circuit response that decays in the fastest possible time without going into oscillation. This consideration is important in control systems where it is required to reach the desired state as quickly as possible without overshooting. _D_<sub>1</sub> and _D_<sub>2</sub> are arbitrary constants determined by boundary conditions. <!--SR:!2025-10-23,119,428!2025-10-30,126,430-->

  - Heinrich Hertz / electromagnetic waves experiment ::@:: He used a dipole antenna consisting of two collinear one-meter wires with a spark gap between their inner ends, and zinc spheres attached to the outer ends for capacitance, as a radiator. The antenna was excited by pulses of high voltage of about 30 kilovolts applied between the two sides from a Ruhmkorff coil. He received the waves with a resonant single-loop antenna with a micrometer spark gap between the ends. This experiment produced and received what are now called radio waves in the very high frequency range. <!--SR:!2025-12-08,165,450!2025-10-13,109,430-->
    - Heinrich Hertz / electromagnetic waves experiment / observations ::@:: Using two wires with a spark gap in between them as the receiver, and connecting a light bulb between them instead. <p> When the emitter is sparking, the light bulb lights up briefly. The distance and relative orientation of the receiver affect the lamp intensity. <p> This proves the existence of electromagnetic waves. Their emission has a distinct spatial pattern. Their amplitudes decay with distance. <!--SR:!2025-12-04,161,448!2025-12-08,165,450-->
- [wave equation](../../../../general/wave%20equation.md) ::@:: It is a second-order linear partial differential equation for the description of waves or standing wave fields such as mechanical waves (e.g. water waves, sound waves and seismic waves) or electromagnetic waves \(including light waves\). It arises in fields like acoustics, electromagnetism, and fluid dynamics. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,29,430!2025-12-05,162,448-->
  - wave equation / scalar wave equation ::@:: The scalar wave equation is $${\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial t^{2} } }=c^{2}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2} } }+{\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2} } }+{\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial z^{2} } }\right)$$ where <p> - _c_ is a fixed non-negative [real](../../../../general/real%20number.md) [coefficient](../../../../general/coefficient.md) representing the [propagation speed](../../../../general/wave.md#wave%20velocity) of the wave <br/> - _u_ is a [scalar field](../../../../general/scalar%20field.md) representing the displacement or, more generally, the conserved quantity \(e.g. [pressure](../../../../general/pressure.md) or [density](../../../../general/density.md)\) <br/> - _x_, _y_ and _z_ are the three spatial coordinates and _t_ being the time coordinate. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,29,430!2025-12-08,165,450-->
  - wave equation / string ::@:: Consider a string with linear mass density $\mu$ and tension $T$. The net force experienced by an infinitesimal segment of the string from $x$ to $x + \Delta x$ is: $$F = T(-\sin\theta + \sin\theta') \approx T(-\tan\theta + \tan\theta') \,,$$ where $\theta$ is the counterclockwise angle from the $x$-axis at $x$ and $\theta'$ is that at $x + \Delta x$, and positive $F$ is upwards. The rightmost equation uses small-angle approximation. $\tan\theta$ can be identified as the slope at $x$, and same for $\tan\theta'$. So we have: $$T\left(-\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}(x) + \frac {\partial f}{\partial x}(x + \Delta x) \right) \approx T \Delta x \frac{\partial^2 f} {\partial x^2}(x) \,.$$ Finally, by Newton's first law: $$\mu \Delta x \frac {\partial^2 f} {\partial t^2} = T \Delta x \frac {\partial^2 f} {\partial x^2} \implies \frac {\partial^2 f} {\partial t^2} = \frac T \mu \frac {\partial^2 f} {\partial x^2} \,,$$ so we can identify the wave speed with $$c = \sqrt{\frac T \mu} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-09-27,93,410!2025-12-02,159,450-->
  - wave equation / general solution ::@:: For the one-dimensional wave equation a relatively simple general solution may be found. Defining new variables $${\begin{aligned}\xi &=x-ct,\\\eta &=x+ct\end{aligned} }$$ changes the wave equation into $${\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial \xi \partial \eta } }(x,t)=0,$$which leads to the general solution $$u(x,t)=F(\xi )+G(\eta )=F(x-ct)+G(x+ct).$$ In other words, the solution is the sum of a right-traveling function _F_ and a left-traveling function _G_. "Traveling" means that the shape of these individual arbitrary functions with respect to _x_ stays constant, however, the functions are translated left and right with time at the speed _c_. This was derived by [Jean le Rond d'Alembert](../../../../general/Jean%20le%20Rond%20d'Alembert.md). <!--SR:!2025-11-27,154,448!2025-06-27,29,430-->

  - sine wave / function of both position and time ::@:: Sinusoids that exist in both position and time also have: <p> - a spatial variable $x$ that represents the _position_ on the dimension on which the wave propagates. <br/> - a [wave number](../../../../general/wave%20number.md) \(or angular wave number\) $k$, which represents the proportionality between the [angular frequency](../../../../general/angular%20frequency.md) $\omega$ and the linear speed \([speed of propagation](../../../../general/phase%20velocity.md)\) $v$: <br/> &emsp; - wavenumber is related to the angular frequency by $k{=}{\frac {\omega }{v} }{=}{\frac {2\pi f}{v} }{=}{\frac {2\pi }{\lambda } }$ where $\lambda$ \([lambda](../../../../general/lambda.md)\) is the [wavelength](../../../../general/wavelength.md). <p> Depending on their direction of travel, they can take the form: <p> - $y(x,t)=A\sin(kx-\omega t+\varphi )$, if the wave is moving to the right, or <br/> - $y(x,t)=A\sin(kx+\omega t+\varphi )$, if the wave is moving to the left. <!--SR:!2025-12-05,162,448!2025-12-08,165,450-->
  - sine wave / Euler's formula ::@:: Using Euler's formula $$e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin\theta \,,$$ we can rewrite the above function as $$y(x, t) = \mathcal R\{A e^{i(kx - \omega t + \varphi)}\}\,.$$ This is related to the _complex_ wave function $$\tilde y(x, t) = A e^{i \varphi} e^{i(kx - \omega t)} = \tilde A e^{i(kx - \omega t)} \,,$$ where $\tilde A = A e^{i }\varphi$. Its real part recovers the sine/cosine wave function. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,29,430!2025-12-05,162,448-->

- electromagnetic radiation
  - electromagnetic radiation / derivation ::@:: From Maxwell's equations, we derive the wave equations for the electric field and the magnetic field. Then use the generic vector wave equation propagation in a particular direction as the electric field. Finally, derive the corresponding magnetic field. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,29,430!2025-12-09,166,450-->
    - electromagnetic radiation / derivation / wave equation for the electric field ::@:: Besides the trivial solution $\mathbf {E} =\mathbf {B} =\mathbf {0}$, useful solutions can be derived with the following [vector identity](../../../../general/vector%20identity.md), valid for all vectors $\mathbf {A}$ in some vector field: $$\nabla \times \left(\nabla \times \mathbf {A} \right)=\nabla \left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {A} \right)-\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {A} .$$ Taking the curl of the second Maxwell's equation yields: $$\nabla \times \left(\nabla \times \mathbf {E} \right)=\nabla \times \left(-{\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t} }\right)$$ Evaluating the left hand side with the above identity and simplifying using the first Maxwell's equation, yields: $$\nabla \times \left(\nabla \times \mathbf {E} \right)=\nabla \left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} \right)-\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {E} =-\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {E} .$$ Evaluating the right hand side by exchanging the sequence of derivatives and inserting the fourth Maxwell's equation, yields: $$\nabla \times \left(-{\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t} }\right)=-{\frac {\partial }{\partial t} }\left(\nabla \times \mathbf {B} \right)=-\mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\mathbf {E} }{\partial t^{2} } }$$ Combining the last two equations again, gives a vector-valued [differential equation](../../../../general/differential%20equation.md) for the electric field, solving the homogeneous Maxwell's equations: $$\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {E} =\mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\mathbf {E} }{\partial t^{2} } }$$ <!--SR:!2025-11-26,154,448!2025-10-17,114,428-->
    - electromagnetic radiation / derivation / wave equation for the magnetic field ::@:: Taking the curl of the fourth Maxwell's equation results in a similar differential equation for a magnetic field solving the homogeneous Maxwell's equations: $$\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {B} =\mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\mathbf {B} }{\partial t^{2} } }.$$ <!--SR:!2025-06-27,29,430!2025-12-04,161,450-->
    - electromagnetic radiation / derivation / wave equations ::@:: Both differential equations have the form of the general [wave equation](../../../../general/wave%20equation.md) for waves propagating with speed $c_{0}$, where $f$ is a function of time and location, which gives the amplitude of the wave at some time at a certain location: $$\nabla ^{2}f={\frac {1}{ {c_{0} }^{2} } }{\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial t^{2} } }$$This is also written as: $$\Box f=0$$where $\Box$ denotes the so-called [d'Alembert operator](../../../../general/d'Alembert%20operator.md), which in Cartesian coordinates is given as: $$\Box =\nabla ^{2}-{\frac {1}{ {c_{0} }^{2} } }{\frac {\partial ^{2} }{\partial t^{2} } }={\frac {\partial ^{2} }{\partial x^{2} } }+{\frac {\partial ^{2} }{\partial y^{2} } }+{\frac {\partial ^{2} }{\partial z^{2} } }-{\frac {1}{ {c_{0} }^{2} } }{\frac {\partial ^{2} }{\partial t^{2} } }\ {}$$ Comparing the terms for the speed of propagation, yields in the case of the electric and magnetic fields: $$c_{0}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {\mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0} } } }.$$ This is the [speed of light](../../../../general/speed%20of%20light.md) in vacuum. Thus Maxwell's equations connect the [vacuum permittivity](../../../../general/vacuum%20permittivity.md) $\varepsilon _{0}$, the [vacuum permeability](../../../../general/vacuum%20permeability.md) $\mu _{0}$, and the speed of light, _c_<sub>0</sub>, via the above equation. <!--SR:!2025-12-08,165,450!2025-12-06,163,448-->
    - electromagnetic radiation / derivation / electric field ::@:: These are only two equations versus the original four, so more information pertains to these waves hidden within Maxwell's equations. A generic vector wave for the electric field has the form $$\mathbf {E} =\mathbf {E} _{0}f{\left({\hat {\mathbf {k} } }\cdot \mathbf {x} -c_{0}t\right)}$$ Here, $\mathbf {E} _{0}$ is a constant vector, $f$ is any second differentiable function, ${\hat {\mathbf {k} } }$ is a unit vector in the direction of propagation, and ${\mathbf {x} }$ is a position vector. $f{\left({\hat {\mathbf {k} } }\cdot \mathbf {x} -c_{0}t\right)}$ is a generic solution to the wave equation. In other words, $$\nabla ^{2}f{\left({\hat {\mathbf {k} } }\cdot \mathbf {x} -c_{0}t\right)}={\frac {1}{ {c_{0} }^{2} } }{\frac {\partial ^{2} }{\partial t^{2} } }f{\left({\hat {\mathbf {k} } }\cdot \mathbf {x} -c_{0}t\right)},$$ for a generic wave traveling in the ${\hat {\mathbf {k} } }$ direction. <p> From the first of Maxwell's equations, we get $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} ={\hat {\mathbf {k} } }\cdot \mathbf {E} _{0}f'{\left({\hat {\mathbf {k} } }\cdot \mathbf {x} -c_{0}t\right)}=0$$ Thus, $$\mathbf {E} \cdot {\hat {\mathbf {k} } }=0$$ which implies that the electric field is orthogonal to the direction the wave propagates. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,29,430!2025-12-01,158,450-->
      - electromagnetic radiation / derivation / electric field / divergence ::@:: $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} ={\hat {\mathbf {k} } }\cdot \mathbf {E} _{0}f'{\left({\hat {\mathbf {k} } }\cdot \mathbf {x} -c_{0}t\right)} \,,$$ because the electric field only changes in the $\hat{\mathbf k}$ direction. <!--SR:!2025-07-13,28,440!2025-07-17,22,420-->

They have a special restricted orientation and proportional magnitudes, $E_{0}=c_{0}B_{0}$, which can be seen immediately from the [Poynting vector](../../../../general/Poynting%20vector.md). The electric field, magnetic field, and direction of wave propagation are all orthogonal, and the wave propagates in the same direction as $\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf {B}$. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,29,430!2025-12-05,162,448-->
    - electromagnetic radiation / derivation / polarization ::@:: From the viewpoint of an electromagnetic wave traveling forward, the electric field might be oscillating up and down, while the magnetic field oscillates right and left. This picture can be rotated with the electric field oscillating right and left and the magnetic field oscillating down and up. This is a different solution that is traveling in the same direction. This arbitrariness in the orientation with respect to propagation direction is known as polarization. On a quantum level, it is described as photon polarization. The direction of the polarization is defined as the direction of the electric field. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,29,430!2025-06-27,29,430-->

  - Poynting vector / plane waves ::@:: In a propagating electromagnetic [plane wave](../../../../general/plane%20wave.md) in an isotropic lossless medium, the instantaneous Poynting vector always points in the direction of propagation while rapidly oscillating in magnitude. This can be simply seen given that in a plane wave, the magnitude of the magnetic field __H__\(_r_,_t_\) is given by the magnitude of the electric field vector __E__\(_r_,_t_\) divided by _η_, the [intrinsic impedance](../../../../general/intrinsic%20impedance.md) of the transmission medium: $$|\mathbf {H} |={\frac {|\mathbf {E} |}{\eta } },$$ where \|__A__\| represents the [vector norm](../../../../general/norm%20(mathematics).md#Euclidean%20norm) of __A__. Since __E__ and __H__ are at right angles to each other, the magnitude of their cross product is the product of their magnitudes. Without loss of generality let us take _X_ to be the direction of the electric field and _Y_ to be the direction of the magnetic field. The instantaneous Poynting vector, given by the cross product of __E__ and __H__ will then be in the positive _Z_ direction: $$\left|{\mathsf {S_{z} } }\right|=\left|{\mathsf {E_{x} } }{\mathsf {H_{y} } }\right|={\frac {\left|{\mathsf {E_{x} } }\right|^{2} }{\eta } }.$$ Finding the time-averaged power in the plane wave then requires averaging over the wave period \(the inverse frequency of the wave\): $$\left\langle {\mathsf {S_{z} } }\right\rangle ={\frac {\left\langle \left|{\mathsf {E_{x} } }\right|^{2}\right\rangle }{\eta } }={\frac {\mathsf {E_{\text{rms} }^{2} } }{\eta } },$$ where _E_<sub>rms</sub> is the [root mean square](../../../../general/root%20mean%20square.md) \(RMS\) electric field amplitude. In the important case that _E_\(_t_\) is sinusoidally varying at some frequency with peak amplitude _E_<sub>peak</sub>, _E_<sub>rms</sub> is ${\mathsf {E_{peak} } }/{\sqrt {2} }$, with the average Poynting vector then given by: $$\left\langle {\mathsf {S_{z} } }\right\rangle ={\frac {\mathsf {E_{peak}^{2} } }{2\eta } }.$$ This is the most common form for the energy flux of a plane wave, since sinusoidal field amplitudes are most often expressed in terms of their peak values, and complicated problems are typically solved considering only one frequency at a time. <!--SR:!2025-09-17,83,408!2025-09-22,89,410-->
    - Poynting vector / plane waves / intensity ::@:: In optics, the value of radiated flux crossing a surface, thus the average Poynting vector component in the direction normal to that surface, is technically known as the [irradiance](../../../../general/irradiance.md), more often simply referred to as the _[intensity](../../../../general/intensity%20(physics).md)_ \(a somewhat ambiguous term\). <p> \(__this course__: Intensity is the average power per unit area transported by an electromagnetic wave.\) <!--SR:!2025-11-30,157,448!2025-10-19,115,428-->
    - Poynting vector / plane waves / intrinsic impedance ::@:: In the case of an ideal [dielectric](../../../../general/dielectric.md) \(where the conductivity is zero\), the equation reduces to the real number $$Z={\sqrt {\mu  \over \varepsilon } }.$$ <!--SR:!2025-11-30,158,450!2025-06-27,29,430-->
  - Poynting vector / radiation pressure ::@:: The density of the linear momentum of the electromagnetic field is _S_/_c_<sup>2</sup> where _S_ is the magnitude of the Poynting vector and _c_ is the speed of light in free space. The [radiation pressure](../../../../general/radiation%20pressure.md) exerted by an electromagnetic wave on the surface of a target is given by $$P_{\mathrm {rad} }={\frac {\langle S\rangle }{\mathrm {c} } }.$$ <!--SR:!2025-10-12,108,428!2025-10-17,113,428-->

  - permittivity / explanation ::@:: In [electromagnetism](../../../../general/electromagnetism.md), the [electric displacement field](../../../../general/electric%20displacement%20field.md) __D__ represents the distribution of electric charges in a given medium resulting from the presence of an electric field __E__. This distribution includes charge migration and electric [dipole](../../../../general/dipole.md) reorientation. Its relation to permittivity in the very simple case of _linear, homogeneous, [isotropic](../../../../general/isotropic.md)_ materials with _"instantaneous" response_ to changes in electric field is: $$\mathbf {D} =\varepsilon \ \mathbf {E}$$ where the permittivity _ε_ is a [scalar](../../../../general/scalar%20(physics).md). If the medium is [anisotropic](../../../../general/anisotropic.md), the permittivity is a second rank [tensor](../../../../general/tensor.md). <p> In SI units, permittivity is measured in [farads](farads.md) per meter \(F/m or A<sup>2</sup>·s<sup>4</sup>·kg<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−3</sup>\). The displacement field __D__ is measured in units of [coulombs](../../../../general/coulomb.md) per [square meter](../../../../general/square%20meter.md) \(C/m<sup>2</sup>\), while the electric field __E__ is measured in [volts](../../../../general/volt.md) per meter \(V/m\). __D__ and __E__ describe the interaction between charged objects. __D__ is related to the _charge densities_ associated with this interaction, while __E__ is related to the _forces_ and _potential differences_. <!--SR:!2025-10-17,114,430!2025-10-24,120,428-->
  - permittivity / validity ::@:: Inside linear, homogeneous, and isotropic medium, we can replace $\varepsilon_0$ with $\varepsilon$ in all equations above, and they would remain valid. <p> In general, permittivity is not a constant, as it can vary with the position in the medium, the frequency of the field applied, humidity, temperature, and other parameters. In a [nonlinear medium](../../../../general/nonlinear%20optics.md), the permittivity can depend on the strength of the electric field. Permittivity as a function of frequency can take on real or complex values. <!--SR:!2025-11-30,158,450!2025-10-18,114,430-->

Permeability is typically represented by the \(italicized\) Greek letter [_μ_](../../../../general/mu%20(letter).md).

  - permeability / magnetic susceptibility ::@:: In terms of relative permeability, the [magnetic susceptibility](../../../../general/magnetic%20susceptibility.md) is $$\chi _{m}=\mu _{r}-1.$$ The number _χ_<sub>m</sub> is a [dimensionless quantity](../../../../general/dimensionless%20quantity.md), sometimes called _volumetric_ or _bulk_ susceptibility, to distinguish it from _χ_<sub>p</sub> \(_magnetic mass_ or _specific_ susceptibility\) and _χ_<sub>M</sub> \(_molar_ or _molar mass_ susceptibility\). <!--SR:!2025-06-27,29,430!2025-07-02,28,410-->
  - permeability / explanation ::@:: In the [macroscopic formulation of electromagnetism](../../../../general/Maxwell's%20equations.md#macroscopic%20formulation), there appear two different kinds of [magnetic field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md): <p> - the [magnetizing field](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md#The%20H-field) __H__ which is generated around electric currents and [displacement currents](../../../../general/displacement%20current.md), and also [emanates from the poles of magnets](../../../../general/demagnetizing%20field.md). The SI units of __H__ are [amperes](../../../../general/ampere.md) per meter. <br/> - the [magnetic flux density](../../../../general/magnetic%20field.md#the%20B-field) __B__ which acts back on the electrical domain, by [curving the motion of charges](../../../../general/Lorentz%20force.md) and causing [electromagnetic induction](../../../../general/electromagnetic%20induction.md). The SI units of __B__ are [volt](../../../../general/volt.md)-seconds per [square meter](../../../../general/square%20meter.md), a ratio equivalent to one [tesla](../../../../general/tesla%20(unit).md). <p> The concept of permeability arises since in many materials \(and in vacuum\), there is a simple relationship between __H__ and __B__ at any location or time, in that the two fields are precisely proportional to each other: $$\mathbf {B} =\mu \mathbf {H} ,$$ where the proportionality factor _μ_ is the permeability, which depends on the material. The [permeability of vacuum](../../../../general/permeability%20of%20vacuum.md) \(also known as permeability of free space\) is a physical constant, denoted _μ_<sub>0</sub>. The SI units of _μ_ are volt-seconds per ampere-meter, equivalently [henry](../../../../general/henry%20(unit).md) per meter. Typically _μ_ would be a scalar, but for an anisotropic material, _μ_ could be a second rank [tensor](../../../../general/tensor.md). <!--SR:!2025-09-09,76,388!2025-09-23,89,410-->
  - permeability / validity ::@:: Inside linear, homogeneous, and isotropic medium, we can replace $\mu_0$ with $\mu$ in all equations above, and they would remain valid. <p> However, inside strong magnetic materials \(such as iron, or [permanent magnets](../../../../general/permanent%20magnet.md)\), there is typically no simple relationship between __H__ and __B__. The concept of permeability is then nonsensical or at least only applicable to special cases such as unsaturated [magnetic cores](../../../../general/magnetic%20core.md). Not only do these materials have nonlinear magnetic behaviour, but often there is significant [magnetic hysteresis](../../../../general/magnetic%20hysteresis.md), so there is not even a single-valued functional relationship between __B__ and __H__. <!--SR:!2025-11-27,154,448!2025-12-03,161,450-->

  - Fresnel equations / overview ::@:: When light strikes the interface between a medium with [refractive index](../../../../general/refractive%20index.md) _n_<sub>1</sub> and a second medium with refractive index _n_<sub>2</sub>, both [reflection](../../../../general/reflection%20(physics).md) and [refraction](../../../../general/refraction.md) of the light may occur. The Fresnel equations give the ratio of the _reflected_ wave's electric field to the incident wave's electric field, and the ratio of the _transmitted_ wave's electric field to the incident wave's electric field, for each of two components of polarization. \(The _magnetic_ fields can also be related using similar coefficients.\) These ratios are generally complex, describing not only the relative amplitudes but also the [phase shifts](../../../../general/reflection%20phase%20change.md) at the interface. <!--SR:!2025-12-10,167,450!2025-12-07,164,448-->
  - Fresnel equations / assumptions ::@:: The equations assume the interface between the media is flat and that the media are homogeneous and isotropic. The incident light is assumed to be a plane wave, which is sufficient to solve any problem since any incident light field can be decomposed into plane waves and polarizations. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,29,430!2025-06-27,29,430-->

    - Fresnel equations / derivation / electromagnetic plane waves ::@:: Dropping the time-varying component $e^{-i \omega t}$, since $\omega$ is the same for the waves being considered \(no Doppler shifts\), we have $$\mathbf E_k e^{i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r} \,,$$ and that the wavenumber is $$k = \omega / v_{\mathrm p} = n \omega / c_0 \,.$$ <p> Assuming homogeneous, linear, and isotropic material, Faraday's law and the Maxwell-Ampère law respectively reduce to $$\begin{aligned} \omega \mathbf B & = \mathbf k \times \mathbf E \implies \omega \mu \mathbf H = \mathbf k \times \mathbf E \\ \omega \mathbf D & = -\mathbf k \times \mathbf H \implies \omega \varepsilon \mathbf E = -\mathbf k \times \mathbf H \,, \end{aligned}$$ so $\mathbf k, \mathbf E, \mathbf H$ forms a right-handed orthogonal triad. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,15,400!2025-07-07,22,420-->
    - Fresnel equations / derivation / admittance, impedance, refractive index, phase velocity ::@:: Assuming homogeneous, linear, and isotropic material, we have: $$\begin{aligned} Y & = \sqrt{\varepsilon / \mu} = 1 / Z \\ Z & = \sqrt{\mu / \varepsilon} = 1 / Y \\ n & = \sqrt{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{rel} } \mu_{\mathrm{rel} } } \\ c_0 / n & = 1 / \sqrt{\varepsilon \mu} \,. \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-24,29,440!2025-07-24,28,440-->

    - Fresnel equations / derivation / _s_ components ::@:: The __E__ field is _perpendicular_ to the plane of incidence. We have: $$\begin{aligned} r_s & = \frac {Y_1 \cos \theta_i - Y_2 \cos \theta_t} {Y_1 \cos \theta_i + Y_2 \cos \theta_t} \\ t_s & = \frac {2 Y_1 \cos \theta_i} {Y_1 \cos \theta_i + Y_2 \cos \theta_t} \,. \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-17,22,420!2025-07-25,30,440-->

We have: $$\begin{aligned} r_p & = \frac {Y_2 \cos \theta_i - Y_1 \cos \theta_t} {Y_2 \cos \theta_i + Y_1 \cos \theta_t} \\ t_p & = \frac {2 Y_1 \cos \theta_i} {Y_2 \cos \theta_i + Y_1 \cos \theta_t} \,. \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-17,21,420!2025-07-13,22,420-->
    - Fresnel equations / derivation / power ratios ::@:: The power ratios $R_s$ and $R_p$ can be found by taking squared magnitudes of $r_s$ and $r_p$ respectively: $$R_s = \lvert r_s \rvert^2 \quad R_p = \lvert r_p \rvert^2 \,.$$ Using conservation of energy, the power ratios $T_s$ and $T_p$ can be found: $$T_s = 1 - R_s \quad T_p = 1 - R_p \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-24,29,440!2025-07-14,29,440-->
    - Fresnel equations / derivation / unpolarized light ::@:: The following holds: $$\begin{aligned} R & = (R_s + R_p) / 2 \\ T & = (T_s + T_p) / 2 \\ 1 & = R + T \,. \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-14,29,440!2025-07-25,29,440-->
    - Fresnel equations / derivation / non-magnetic media ::@:: Assuming $\mu_i = \mu_0$. Then, $$Y_i = \frac {n_i} {c \mu_0} \propto n_i \,.$$ Then most equations above can be rewritten by replacing $Y_i$ with $n_i$. <!--SR:!2025-07-16,20,420!2025-07-07,22,420-->
    - Fresnel equations / derivation / Brewster's angle ::@:: Recall $$r_p = \frac {n_2 \cos \theta_i - n_1 \cos \theta_t} {n_2 \cos \theta_i + n_1 \cos \theta_t} \,.$$ If $\theta_i$ and $\theta_t$ are complementary, then the numerator can become $$n_2 \sin \theta_t - n_1 \sin \theta_i = 0 \,,$$ where the last equality is by the law of refraction \(Snell's law\). To make $\theta_i$ and $\theta_t$ complementary, we transform the law of refraction: $$\frac {\sin \theta_i} {\sin \theta_t} = \frac {n_2} {n_1} \implies \frac {\sin \theta_i} {\cos \theta_i} = \frac {n_2} {n_1} \implies \tan \theta_i = \frac {n_2} {n_1} \,.$$ The solution to the above equation is the __Brewster's angle__, at which the reflected light only contains _s_ components and no _p_ components. <!--SR:!2025-07-17,21,420!2025-07-26,30,440-->
    - Fresnel equations / derivation / this course ::@:: \(__this course__: We define _alpha_ as: $$\alpha := \frac {\cos \theta_t} {\cos \theta_i} \,,$$ and _beta_ as: $$\beta := \frac {\mu_1 v_1} {\mu_2 v_2} = \frac {\mu_1 n_2} {\mu_2 n_1} = \frac {\sqrt{\mu_1 / \varepsilon_1} } {\sqrt{\mu_2 / \varepsilon_2} } = \frac {Z_1} {Z_2} = \frac {Y_2} {Y_1} \,.$$ Then the transmission coefficients for _p_ components can be rewritten as: $$\begin{aligned} r_p & = \frac {Y_2 \cos \theta_i - Y_1 \cos \theta_t} {Y_2 \cos \theta_i + Y_1 \cos \theta_t} = \frac {\frac {Y_2} {Y_1} - \frac {\cos \theta_t} {\cos \theta_i} } {\frac {Y_2} {Y_1} + \frac {\cos \theta_t} {\cos \theta_i} } = \frac {\beta - \alpha} {\beta + \alpha} \\ t_p & = \frac {2 Y_1 \cos \theta_i} {Y_2 \cos \theta_i + Y_1 \cos \theta_t} = \frac 2 {\frac {Y_2} {Y_1} + \frac {\cos \theta_t} {\cos \theta_i} } = \frac 2 {\beta + \alpha} \,. \end{aligned}$$ Further note the course uses the alternative sign convention, thus for $r_p$ it becomes: $$r_p = \frac {\alpha - \beta} {\alpha + \beta} \,.$$ and $t_p$ remains the same.\) <!--SR:!2025-07-24,29,440!2025-07-16,21,420-->

  - electrical conductor / charge dissipation ::@:: Put a free charge density $\rho_0$ in a homogeneous, linear, and isotropic material of electrical conductivity $\sigma$ and permittivity $\varepsilon$ at time $t = 0$, i.e. $\rho(0) = \rho_0$. <p> We have: $$\begin{aligned} \frac {\partial \rho} {\partial t} & = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf J \\ & = -\sigma \nabla \cdot \mathbf E \\ & = -\frac \sigma \varepsilon \rho \,, \end{aligned}$$ which has the \(somewhat obvious\) solution: $$\rho(t) = \rho_0 e^{-(\sigma / \varepsilon) t} \,,$$ where $\lambda := \sigma / \varepsilon$ is the decay factor and $\tau := 1 / \lambda = \varepsilon / \sigma$ is the decay time constant. <p> We see higher electrical conductivity $\sigma$ means the free charge dissipates faster, as expected. <!--SR:!2025-07-17,21,420!2025-07-17,21,420-->
  - electrical conductor / absorption of electromagnetic waves ::@:: Electrical conductors absorb electromagnetic waves. To see it, we replace $$\nabla \times \mathbf B = \mu \varepsilon \frac {\partial \mathbf E} {\partial t}$$ with $$\mathbf B = \mu \varepsilon \frac {\partial \mathbf E} {\partial t} + \mu \sigma \mathbf E \,,$$ where $\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity. Repeating the steps to derive the fields for electromagnetic waves, we get: $$\begin{aligned} \nabla^2 \mathbf E & = \mu \varepsilon \frac {\partial^2 \mathbf E} {\partial t^2} + \mu \sigma \frac {\partial \mathbf E} {\partial t} \\ \nabla^2 \mathbf B & = \mu \varepsilon \frac {\partial^2 \mathbf B} {\partial t^2} + \mu \sigma \frac {\partial \mathbf B} {\partial t} \,. \end{aligned}$$ The plane waves are still solutions to the above equations \(believe in this for now\): $$\mathbf E = \mathbf E_0 e^{i(\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf x - \omega t)} \qquad \mathbf B = \mathbf B_0 e^{i(\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf x - \omega t)} \,,$$ but the wavenumber \(magnitude of $\mathbf k$\) is now complex number. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,21,420!2025-07-06,21,420-->

This increase compared to the unattenuated wavenumber $\omega / v$ implies the actual phase velocity is _lowered_. <p> For physical wave behaviors, you can simply replace unattenuated wavenumber with attenuated wavenumber in the equations. <!--SR:!2025-07-26,30,440!2025-07-24,29,440-->

    - electrical conductor / absorption of electromagnetic waves / magnetic field ::@:: Assuming the electric field is: $$\mathbf E = \mathbf E_0 e^{i(\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf x - \omega t)} \,,$$ then the magnetic field is: $$\mathbf B = \frac {k} {\omega} \hat{\mathbf k} \times \mathbf E_0 e^{i(\mathbf k \cdot x - \omega t)} \,,$$ thus $$\mathbf B_0 = \frac k \omega \hat{\mathbf k} \times \mathbf E_0 \,.$$ But remember the wavenumber $k$ is now a complex number. In particular, its imaginary part is positive, so if we write $k$ in phasor form $$k = \lvert k \rvert e^{i\arg(k)} \,,$$ then we see it retards the magnetic field phase by $\arg(k)$. \(Imagine merging the term with $-\omega t$ by changing $t$, then you should see $t$ needs to be reduced, so we are going backward in time.\) That is, the magnetic field lags behind the electric field. <!--SR:!2025-07-26,30,440!2025-07-07,22,420-->

  - electrical conductor / Fresnel equations ::@:: Most of the above derivations still apply. All of the final equations apply. You replace the transmission wavenumber with the complex wavenumber $$k = \frac \omega v \sqrt{\frac {\sqrt{1 + (\sigma / \varepsilon \omega)^2} + 1} 2} + i \frac \omega v \sqrt{\frac {\sqrt{1 + (\sigma / \varepsilon \omega)^2} - 1} 2} \,.$$ The admittance is given by: $$Y = \frac 1 Z = \sqrt{\frac {i \omega \varepsilon - \sigma} {i \omega \mu} } = \sqrt{\frac \varepsilon \mu + i \frac \sigma {\omega \mu} } \ne \sqrt{\frac \varepsilon \mu} + i \sqrt{\frac {\sigma} {\omega \mu} } \,.$$ \(This later inequality is to remind to not stuck on this mistake for 4 hours...\) It is related to the complex wavenumber by: $$Y = \sqrt{\frac \varepsilon \mu + i \frac \sigma {\omega \mu} } = \frac {\sqrt{\varepsilon \mu \omega^2 + i \sigma \mu \omega} } {\mu \omega} = \frac {\sqrt{k^2} } {\mu \omega} = \frac k {\mu \omega} \,.$$ <p> Note: If the wave plane equation is in this form instead \(electrical engineering convention\): $$\mathbf E_0 e^{j(\omega t - \mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r)} \,,$$ then we have: $$Y = \sqrt{\frac {j \omega \varepsilon + \sigma} {j \omega \mu} } = \sqrt{\frac \varepsilon \mu - j \frac \sigma {\omega \mu} } \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-17,22,420!2025-06-30,15,400-->
    - electrical conductor / Fresnel equations / this course ::@:: \(__this course__: We define _alpha_ as: $$\alpha := \frac {\cos \theta_t} {\cos \theta_i} \,,$$ and _beta_ as: $$\beta := \frac {\mu_1 v_1} {\mu_2} \frac {\tilde k_2} \omega = \frac {\mu_1 v_1} {\mu_2 \tilde v_2 } = \frac {\mu_1 \tilde n_2} {\mu_2 n_1} = \frac {Z_1} {Z_2} = \frac {Y_2} {Y_1} \,.$$ Then the transmission coefficients for _p_ components can be rewritten as: $$\begin{aligned} r_p & = \frac {Y_2 \cos \theta_i - Y_1 \cos \theta_t} {Y_2 \cos \theta_i + Y_1 \cos \theta_t} = \frac {\frac {Y_2} {Y_1} - \frac {\cos \theta_t} {\cos \theta_i} } {\frac {Y_2} {Y_1} + \frac {\cos \theta_t} {\cos \theta_i} } = \frac {\beta - \alpha} {\beta + \alpha} \\ t_p & = \frac {2 Y_1 \cos \theta_i} {Y_2 \cos \theta_i + Y_1 \cos \theta_t} = \frac 2 {\frac {Y_2} {Y_1} + \frac {\cos \theta_t} {\cos \theta_i} } = \frac 2 {\beta + \alpha} \,. \end{aligned}$$ Further note the course uses the alternative sign convention, thus for $r_p$ it becomes: $$r_p = \frac {\alpha - \beta} {\alpha + \beta} \,.$$ and $t_p$ remains the same.\) <!--SR:!2025-07-17,22,420!2025-07-17,21,420-->
    - electrical conductor / Fresnel equations / reflection ::@:: For a perfect conductor, i.e. $\sigma \to +\infty$, the imaginary part of $\beta$ becomes much larger than the real part, so $r_p = (\beta - \alpha) / (\beta + \alpha) \to 1$ and $t_p = 2/(\beta + \alpha) \to 0$. This means the _p_ components do not get transmitted and get reflected completely, and its electric field phase is shifted by 180° \($r_p$ is the _negated_ ratio for the electric field\). <!--SR:!2025-07-24,29,440!2025-07-17,21,420-->
      - electrical conductor / Fresnel equations / reflection / applications ::@:: For example, you can make metal mirrors and silvered mirrors! Since the skin depth of silver is less than 10&nbsp;nm, a very thin coating of silver on something \(usually glass to keep it from tarnishing\) makes a good mirror. <!--SR:!2025-07-17,21,420!2025-07-25,29,440-->

- topic: interference
- [wave interference](../../../../general/wave%20interference.md) ::@:: In [physics](../../../../general/physics.md), \(_this_\) is a phenomenon in which two [coherent](../../../../general/coherence%20(physics).md) [waves](../../../../general/wave.md) are combined by adding their intensities or displacements with due consideration for their [phase difference](../../../../general/phase%20(waves).md). <!--SR:!2025-07-25,29,440!2025-07-26,30,440-->
  - wave interference / types ::@:: The resultant wave may have greater amplitude \(__constructive interference__\) or lower amplitude \(__destructive interference__\) if the two waves are in phase or out of phase, respectively. <!--SR:!2025-07-26,30,440!2025-07-26,30,440-->
  - wave interference / occurrences ::@:: Interference effects can be observed with all types of waves, for example, [light](../../../../general/light%20wave.md), [radio](../../../../general/radio%20wave.md), [acoustic](../../../../general/sound%20wave.md#waves), [surface water waves](../../../../general/surface%20wave.md), [gravity waves](../../../../general/gravity%20wave.md), or [matter waves](../../../../general/matter%20wave.md) as well as in loudspeakers as electrical waves. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,21,420!2025-07-25,30,440-->
  - wave interference / phase difference ::@:: For interference between two _monochromatic_ \(one wavelength\) and _coherent_ \(constant _relative_ phase\), we can consider _path difference_, which is the difference in spatial distance traveled. <p> The _angular phase difference_ is given by multiplying this distance by the _wavenumber_. <p> This works because only the spatial-varying component can differ. The time-varying component is always the same. <!--SR:!2025-07-13,28,440!2025-07-05,20,420-->
  - wave interference / types
    - wave interference / types / phase difference ::@:: Divide the phase difference by $2\pi$. If it is an integer, _constructive_ interference occurs. If it is an integer plus one half, _destructive_ interference occurs. In between, various level of interference occurs. <!--SR:!2025-07-25,29,440!2025-07-07,22,420-->
- [double-slit experiment](../../../../general/double-slit%20experiment.md) ::@:: In modern physics, the \(_this_\) demonstrates that light and matter can exhibit behavior of both classical particles and classical waves. This type of experiment was first performed by Thomas Young in 1801, as a demonstration of the wave behavior of visible light. <!--SR:!2025-07-24,29,440!2025-07-25,29,440-->
  - double-slit experiment / basic version ::@:: In the basic version of this experiment, a coherent light source, such as a laser beam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate. The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing through the two slits to interfere, producing bright and dark bands on the screen – a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles. However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles \(not waves\); the interference pattern appears via the varying density of these particle hits on the screen. <!--SR:!2025-07-24,28,440!2025-07-24,28,440-->
- wave interference
  - wave interference / amplitude and phase ::@:: Consider two waves with phase difference $\phi$ \(positive is advanced, negative is retarded\): $$E e^{i\omega t} \qquad E e^{i(\omega t + \phi)} \,.$$ Adding them together: $$\begin{aligned} & \phantom = E e^{i\omega t} + E e^{i(\omega t + \phi)} \\ & = E e^{i\omega t} \left(1 + e^{i\phi}\right) \\ & = E e^{i (\omega t + \phi / 2)} \left(e^{-i \phi / 2} + e^{i \phi / 2} \right) \\ & = 2E \cos(\phi / 2) e^{i (\omega t + \phi / 2)} \,, \end{aligned}$$ so we see the electric field amplitude is $2E \cos (\phi / 2)$ and the phase advances by $\phi / 2$, i.e. the resulting phase is the average of the two phases. <p> Thus, intensity has: $$I = I_0 \cos^2(\phi / 2) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-20,29,440!2025-07-25,30,440-->
  - wave interference / double-slit experiment ::@:: Consider two slits with a separating distance $d$ emitting coherent light. Assuming the display distance $D$ is very high \(which is usually the case in experiments\), then these light rays from these two slits approaching the same point on the display are approximately parallel. At this point, we see the path difference is: $$d \sin \theta \,,$$ where $\theta$ is the angle relative to the perpendicular bisector angle. Then the phase difference is: $$\phi = k d\sin\theta = \frac {2\pi d \sin \theta} \lambda \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-24,29,440!2025-07-17,21,420-->
  - wave interference / bright fringes ::@:: Using the phase difference $$\phi = \frac {2\pi d \sin \theta} \lambda \,,$$ the intensity on the display follows: $$I = I_0 \cos^2 \left(\frac {d \sin \theta} {\lambda} \right) \,,$$ meaning maximum intensity $I_0$ is achieved when $d \sin \theta$ is an integer multiple of $\lambda$ and minimum when it is an integer plus half multiple of $\lambda$. <p> Further approximation involves assuming $\theta$ is also very small, so that $\sin \theta \approx y / D$, where $y$ is the distance on the display from the perpendicular bisector of the two slits. Then we have $$d \sin \theta \approx d y / D \,.$$ <p> We see _bright fringes_ near the center are approximately evenly spaced, while those far away become increasingly spaced. <!--SR:!2025-07-24,28,440!2025-07-17,22,420-->
    - wave interference / bright fringes / constant intensity ::@:: Above, we assume intensity only varies with the phase difference. So all bright fringes should be of equal intensity. <p> But if we do the double-slit experiment, we actually see that the bright fringe intensity decay with distance from the center. This is related to _diffraction_. <!--SR:!2025-07-25,30,440!2025-07-24,29,440-->

- topic: diffraction
- [diffraction](../../../../general/diffraction.md) ::@:: \(_this_\) is the deviation of waves from straight-line propagation without any change in their energy due to an obstacle or through an aperture. The diffracting object or aperture effectively becomes a secondary source of the propagating wave. <!--SR:!2025-07-17,21,420!2025-07-14,29,440-->
  - diffraction / interference ::@:: Diffraction is the same physical effect as interference, but interference is typically applied to superposition of a few waves and the term diffraction is used when many waves are superposed. <p> You can think of a gap as infinitely many small slits to see how interference from many waves models diffraction. <!--SR:!2025-07-15,30,440!2025-07-16,20,420-->
  - diffraction / mechanism ::@:: In classical physics diffraction arises because of how waves propagate; this is described by the Huygens–Fresnel principle and the principle of superposition of waves. The propagation of a wave can be visualized by considering every particle of the transmitted medium on a wavefront as a point source for a secondary spherical wave. The wave displacement at any subsequent point is the sum of these secondary waves. When waves are added together, their sum is determined by the relative phases as well as the amplitudes of the individual waves so that the summed amplitude of the waves can have any value between zero and the sum of the individual amplitudes. Hence, diffraction patterns usually have a series of maxima and minima. <!--SR:!2025-07-25,29,440!2025-07-15,30,440-->
- [Huygens' principle](../../../../general/Huygens'%20principle.md) ::@:: The \(_this_\) \(named after [Dutch](../../../../general/Netherlands.md) [physicist](../../../../general/physicist.md) [Christiaan Huygens](../../../../general/Christiaan%20Huygens.md) and [French](../../../../general/France.md) physicist [Augustin-Jean Fresnel](../../../../general/Augustin-Jean%20Fresnel.md)\) states that every point on a [wavefront](../../../../general/wavefront.md) is itself the source of spherical wavelets, and the secondary wavelets emanating from different points mutually [interfere](../../../../general/wave%20interference.md). <!--SR:!2025-07-25,30,440!2025-07-24,29,440-->
  - Huygens' principle / mathematical expression ::@:: Consider the case of a point source located at a point __P__<sub>0</sub>, vibrating at a [frequency](../../../../general/frequency.md) _f_. The disturbance may be described by a complex variable _U_<sub>0</sub> known as the [complex amplitude](../../../../general/complex%20amplitude.md). It produces a spherical wave with [wavelength](../../../../general/wavelength.md) λ, [wavenumber](../../../../general/wavenumber.md) _k_ = 2<!-- markdown separator -->_π_<!-- markdown separator -->/<!-- markdown separator -->_λ_. Within a constant of proportionality, the complex amplitude of the primary wave at the point __Q__ located at a distance _r_<sub>0</sub> from __P__<sub>0</sub> is: $$U(r_{0})\propto {\frac {U_{0}e^{ikr_{0} } }{r_{0} } }.$$ Note that [magnitude](../../../../general/amplitude.md) decreases in inverse proportion to the distance traveled, and the phase changes as _k_ times the distance traveled. <!--SR:!2025-07-26,30,440!2025-07-24,28,440-->
- [Fraunhofer diffraction](../../../../general/Fraunhofer%20diffraction.md) ::@:: In optics, the \(_this_\) equation is used to model the diffraction of waves when plane waves are incident on a diffracting object, and the diffraction pattern is viewed at a sufficiently long distance \(a distance satisfying Fraunhofer condition\) from the object \(in the far-field region\), and also when it is viewed at the focal plane of an imaging lens. <!--SR:!2025-07-14,29,440!2025-07-16,20,420-->
  - Fraunhofer diffraction / Fresnel diffraction ::@:: In contrast, the diffraction pattern created near the diffracting object and \(in the near field region\) is given by the Fresnel diffraction equation. <!--SR:!2025-07-15,30,440!2025-07-24,29,440-->
  - Fraunhofer diffraction / single-slit diffraction minima ::@:: We can find the angle at which a first minimum is obtained in the diffracted light by the following reasoning. Consider the light diffracted at an angle θ where the distance _CD_ is equal to the wavelength of the illuminating light. The width of the slit is the distance _AC_. The component of the wavelet emitted from the point A which is travelling in the θ direction is in [anti-phase](../../../../general/phase%20(waves).md#phase%20shift) with the wave from the point _B_ at middle of the slit, so that the net contribution at the angle θ from these two waves is zero. The same applies to the points just below _A_ and _B_, and so on. Therefore, the amplitude of the total wave travelling in the direction θ is zero. We have: $$\theta _{\text{min} }\approx {\frac {CD}{AC} }={\frac {\lambda }{W} }.$$ The angle subtended by the first minima on either side of the centre is then, as above: $$\alpha =2\theta _{\text{min} }={\frac {2\lambda }{W} }.$$ <p> There is no such simple argument to enable us to find the maxima of the diffraction pattern. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,22,420!2025-07-02,17,400-->
    - Fraunhofer diffraction / single-slit diffraction minima / approximation ::@:: For small $\angle$, the _dark_ \(not _bright_, unlike interference\) occur when $a \sin \theta$ is an _nonzero_ integer multiple of $\lambda$, where $a$ is the slit width. <!--SR:!2025-07-26,30,440!2025-07-24,29,440-->
  - Fraunhofer diffraction / single-slit diffraction intensity ::@:: Now we need to consider infinitely many slits. One way is to consider each infinitesimal width as a point source using Huygens' principle. Each point source contributes: $$\,\mathrm dE = \frac A {r'} e^{i(kr' - \omega t)} \,,$$ where $r' = r + y \sin \theta$. We approximate $A / r'$ as $A / r$, since $r$ is assumed large. <p> Integrate over the slit width, considering each infinitesimal width as a point source: $$\begin{aligned} E & \approx \frac A r e^{i(k r - \omega t)} \int_{-W / 2}^{W / 2} e^{i k y \sin \theta} \\ & = \frac A r e^{i(k r - \omega t)} \frac 1 {i k \sin \theta} \left[e^{i k y \sin \theta} \right]_{y = -W / 2}^{y = W / 2} \\ & = \frac A r e^{i(kr - \omega t)} \frac {2 \sin\left(\frac {k W} 2 \sin \theta \right)} {k \sin \theta} \\ & = \frac {AW} r e^{i(kr - \omega t)} \frac {\sin\left(\frac {k W} 2 \sin \theta \right)} {\frac {k W} 2 \sin \theta} \\ & = \frac {AW} r e^{i(kr - \omega t)} \operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac {kW} 2 \sin \theta \right) \,. \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-11,15,400!2025-07-11,15,400-->
    - Fraunhofer diffraction / single-slit diffraction intensity / result ::@:: The corresponding intensity expression is also written as $$I \approx I_0 \operatorname{sinc}^2\left(\frac {\pi W} \lambda \sin \theta \right) \,,$$ dropping the wave component and using $I_0$ as the intensity at the central maximum \($\theta = 0$\). <!--SR:!2025-07-05,20,420!2025-07-06,21,420-->
    - Fraunhofer diffraction / single-slit diffraction intensity / maxima ::@:: The maxima positions must be found numerically, as the intensity equation derivative is a transcendental equation. <!--SR:!2025-07-24,29,440!2025-07-25,30,440-->
- double-slit experiment
  - double-slit experiment / intensity ::@:: For far fields, we modulate the ideal interference pattern intensity using Fraunhofer diffraction: $$I = I_0 \cos^2\left(\frac {\pi d} \lambda \sin \theta \right) \operatorname{sinc}^2 \left(\frac {\pi W} \lambda \sin \theta \right) \,.$$ <p> We see as $W \to 0$, we recover the ideal interference pattern. We see as $d \to 0$, we recover the ideal Fraunhofer diffraction pattern. <!--SR:!2025-07-16,20,420!2025-07-07,22,420-->
