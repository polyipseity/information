## hints

1. calculating earnings per share ::@:: Divide "Net Income Avail to Common, GAAP" by the weighted average number of shares to get "Basic EPS, GAAP". <p> Divide "Net Income Avail to Common, Adj", which cancels out abnormal and extraordinary gains and losses, by the weighted average number of shares to get "Basic EPS from Cont Ops, Adjusted". <!--SR:!2025-11-07,16,290!2025-11-01,10,270-->
    - calculating earnings per share / multiple listings ::@:: While the earnings per share \(EPS\) figures differ between Alibaba's Hong Kong‑listed shares \(9988 HK\) and its US‑listed counterpart \(BABA US\), their price‑to‑earnings \(P/E\) ratios should be identical when adjusted for the share conversion. <p> Using Bloomberg, one can see that a single BABA US share represents eight 9988 HK shares via the "Receipt Info" page in the DES section. According to the annual report, the EPS of 9988 HK is 3.91 and that of BABA US is 31.24; dividing the latter by the former yields exactly 8, confirming the conversion factor. <!--SR:!2025-11-07,16,290!2025-11-01,10,270-->
