## content

- [economic indicator](../../../../../../general/economic%20indicator.md) ::@:: It is a statistic about an economic activity. Economic indicators allow analysis of economic performance and predictions of future performance. <!--SR:!2026-01-12,66,310!2025-12-29,54,310-->
  - economic indicator / most important indicator ::@:: gross domestic product \(GDP\) <!--SR:!2026-01-12,66,310!2026-01-05,60,310-->
- [gross domestic product](../../../../general/gross%20domestic%20product.md) \(GDP\) ::@:: It is a monetary measure of the total market value of all the final goods and services produced and rendered in a specific time period by a country or countries. <!--SR:!2026-01-13,67,310!2026-01-12,66,310-->
  - gross domestic product / subjectivity ::@:: Changes in GDP _measurement_ can lead to drastic changes in GDP, showing that GDP is somewhat _subjective_. <!--SR:!2026-01-05,60,310!2026-01-08,63,310-->
- economic indicator
  - economic indicator / important indicators ::@:: economic growth \(GDP growth\), inflation, unemployment, business confidence, housing <!--SR:!2026-01-13,67,310!2026-01-01,57,310-->
- gross domestic product
  - gross domestic product / formula ::@:: __GDP \(Y\)__ is the sum of __consumption \(C\)__, __investment \(I\)__, __government expenditures \(G\)__ and __net exports \(X − M\)__. <p> &emsp; __Y__ = __C__ + __I__ + __G__ + __\(X − M\)__ <!--SR:!2026-01-12,66,310!2026-01-04,59,310-->
  - gross domestic product / economic growth ::@:: Simply the percentage change of GDP. You most likely want to use _real_ GDP rather than _nominal_ GDP, as we typically want to exclude the effects of _inflation_. <!--SR:!2026-01-13,67,310!2026-01-07,62,310-->
  - gross domestic product / nominal GDP ::@:: The raw GDP figure given by the equations above is called the nominal, historical, or current GDP. <!--SR:!2026-01-12,66,310!2026-01-12,66,310-->
  - gross domestic product / real GDP ::@:: The GDP adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real GDP. <!--SR:!2026-01-02,58,310!2026-01-06,61,310-->
  - gross domestic product / economic growth
    - gross domestic product / economic growth / nominal, real ::@:: When rates are small and periods are short, the inflation rate in percentage can be approximated by subtracting the former by the latter, both in percentages. <!--SR:!2026-01-13,67,310!2026-05-29,164,310-->
    - gross domestic product / economic growth / recession ::@:: It is defined as two or more successive quarters of negative real GDP growth. <!--SR:!2026-01-04,59,310!2026-01-12,66,310-->
- [inflation](../../../../general/inflation.md) ::@:: It is an increase in the average price of goods and services in terms of money. This increase is measured using a price index, typically a consumer price index \(CPI\). <!--SR:!2025-12-31,56,310!2026-01-08,63,310-->
  - inflation / measures ::@:: The consumer price index \(CPI\), the personal consumption expenditures price index \(PCEPI\) and the GDP deflator are some examples of broad price indices. <!--SR:!2026-01-13,67,310!2026-01-12,66,310-->
- [unemployment](../../../../general/unemployment.md) ::@:: It is the proportion of people above a specified age \(usually 15\) not being in paid employment or self-employment but currently available for work during the reference period. <!--SR:!2026-01-12,66,310!2026-01-13,67,310-->
  - unemployment / Okun's law ::@:: It is an empirically observed relationship between unemployment and losses in a country's production. Quarterly changes in unemployment rate is inversely related to the corresponding changes in real GDP. <!--SR:!2026-01-06,61,310!2026-01-13,67,310-->
- [Purchasing Managers' Index](../../../../general/Purchasing%20Managers'%20Index.md) \(PMI\) ::@:: They are economic indicators derived from monthly surveys of private sector companies. <!--SR:!2026-01-13,67,310!2026-01-12,66,310-->
  - Purchasing Managers' Index / principal producers ::@:: The three principal producers of PMIs are S&P Global \(from 2022 merger with IHS Markit\), which produces PMIs for over 30 countries worldwide and developed the first service sector PMIs, and the Institute for Supply Management \(ISM\), which originated the manufacturing surveys produced for the United States. <!--SR:!2025-12-30,55,310!2026-01-04,59,310-->
  - Purchasing Managers' Index / use ::@:: They are widely used often due to their ability to give a reliable \(annotation: _leading_\) indicator of key economic variables such as gross domestic product \(GDP\) and consumer price inflation \(CPI\). <!--SR:!2025-12-29,54,310!2025-12-30,55,310-->
- [housing starts](../../../../general/housing%20starts.md) ::@:: It is an economic indicator that reflects the number of privately owned new houses \(technically _housing units_\) on which construction has been started in a given period. <!--SR:!2026-01-13,67,310!2026-01-05,60,310-->
  - housing starts / GDP ::@:: While housing themselves contribute slightly to the GDP, housing-related work and confidence required to purchase houses in the first place \(e.g. mortgages\) make it a reliable indicator of GDP. <!--SR:!2026-01-07,62,310!2026-01-02,58,310-->
- gross domestic product
  - gross domestic product / guess ::@:: Producing GDP report is a painstaking process and takes a long time. For example, in the United States, they are released every quarter a month after the end of the quarter, which is too late! <p> Traders instead guess the GDP ahead of time, e.g. using _leading_ indicators. <!--SR:!2026-01-13,67,310!2026-01-13,67,310-->
    - gross domestic product / guess / leading indicators ::@:: Compare the actual indicator value to the expected value \(median of survey of analysts\). <p> In the United States, PMI, nonfarm payrolls, housing starts, and CPI \(released in this order\) are released monthly. <!--SR:!2026-01-01,57,310!2026-01-07,62,310-->
- [economic forecasting](../../../../general/economic%20forecasting.md) ::@:: It is the process of making predictions about the economy. Forecasts can be made at a high level of aggregation—for example, for GDP, inflation, unemployment, or the fiscal deficit. They can also be made at a more disaggregated level, targeting specific economic sectors or even individual firms. <p> "When the facts change, I change my mind." — John Maynard Keynes <!--SR:!2026-01-06,61,310!2026-01-12,66,310-->
  - economic forecasting / timescale ::@:: short-term <br/> long-term: which is much harder <!--SR:!2026-01-01,57,310!2025-12-31,56,310-->
  - economic forecasting / turning point ::@:: Some major events may change the expectations of most analysts, changing the forecast significantly in one way or the other, e.g. Brexit, unexpectedly good economic indicators, etc. <!--SR:!2026-01-02,58,310!2026-01-12,66,310-->
  - economic forecasting / economic surprise index ::@:: It aggregates multiple economic indicators and shows by how much the actual economic indicators are mostly better or worse than expected. <p> It has some _predictive_ power of the stock index but does not _always_ work. \(Models work beautifully until they don't.\) <!--SR:!2026-01-13,67,310!2026-01-02,58,310-->
