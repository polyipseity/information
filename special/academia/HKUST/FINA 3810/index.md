- Bloomberg Terminal
  - Bloomberg Terminal / multiple listings ::@:: Bloomberg's equity data is reported per the _listing_ that you query, not per the underlying company's total share base. <p> When a firm is dual‑listed or issued ADRs, each listing represents a different number of the company's "true" shares – e.g., 1 US share = 8 HK shares. Consequently, the EPS shown for the US ticker reflects earnings divided by 8 times as many underlying shares, so it appears eight times larger than the HK‑listed EPS. <p> Bloomberg's "Receipt Info" page simply tells you this conversion factor so you can see why the raw EPS figures differ.

- topic: economic research; economic analysis; graph; idea generation; Bloomberg Global Trading Challenge; narrative
- Bloomberg Terminal
  - Bloomberg Terminal / economic functionalities ::@:: economic research & forecasts, central bank analysis, country & default risk monitor, etc.
    - Bloomberg Terminal / economic functionalities / economic research & forecasts ::@:: A comprehensive set of tools that provide macro‑economic estimates, real‑time data, and forward guidance from central banks worldwide. This includes calendars for key releases, surprise indices, inflation monitors, and regression models to assess the impact of new data on markets.
    - Bloomberg Terminal / economic functionalities / central bank analysis ::@:: Dedicated pages such as the "Fed Forward Guidance Dashboard", "Fed Statement and Minutes" screen, and a "Taylor Rule Model" give analysts instant access to policy statements, minutes, and quantitative frameworks for interpreting Fed moves.
    - Bloomberg Terminal / economic functionalities / country & default risk monitor ::@:: A sovereign debt dashboard tracks default risk and credit spreads for individual countries, while the "Sovereign Default Model" projects potential defaults based on macro fundamentals.
  - Bloomberg Terminal / economic calendar \(`ECO`\) ::@:: Enter __`ECO <GO>`__ to open the Economic Calendar. The screen lists all upcoming macro releases worldwide, sorted by date and country, with columns for event name, consensus estimate, actual value, surprise, and source. You can filter by region or importance, set alerts for specific events, view historical data in a chart, and export the list as CSV for further analysis—all from this single, interactive dashboard.
  - Bloomberg Terminal / economic analyzer \(`ECAN`\) ::@:: Type __`ECAN <GO>`__ to open US Non‑Farm Payrolls screen. The page instantly shows the most recent payroll release, the month‑over‑month net change, and an industry‑by‑industry heat map of job gains or losses. Above the table you'll see the consensus estimate, actual figure, and surprise percentage, while a "News" tab displays headline coverage tied to the event. You can drill into historical data by selecting past dates, export the table for analysis, or set alerts so you’re notified whenever a new payroll report is published.
  - Bloomberg Terminal / Federal Open Market Committee \(`FOMC`\) ::@:: Type __`FOMC <GO>`__ to launch Bloomberg's Federal Open Market Committee screen. The terminal displays the latest meeting date, minutes, and any policy announcements \(rate changes or forward guidance\). A "Minutes" tab shows the full text of the FOMC's discussion, while a "Forward Guidance" panel visualizes the committee's projections for future rates. <p> You can also view the "Dot Plot".
  - Bloomberg Terminal / dot plot \(`DOTS`\) ::@:: Enter __`DOTS <GO>`__ on the Bloomberg terminal to access the Fed "dot‑plot" screen, which shows each Federal Reserve official's individual forecast for the federal funds rate at future policy meetings. The interface displays a scatter chart where each dot represents an official's projection, color‑coded by committee member and shaded by the expected duration of the target range. You can hover over dots to see precise rate numbers, toggle historical periods or different meeting dates, and export the plotted data for analysis or presentation. <p> This tool is essential for tracking market expectations of monetary policy moves.
  - Bloomberg Terminal / Fed Forward-Guidance \(`WIRP`\) ::@:: Type __`WIRP <GO>`__ to open Bloomberg's "Fed Forward‑Guidance" dashboard. This screen aggregates the Fed's projected policy path, displaying a table of future meeting dates alongside the implied federal funds target rate and the number of rate hikes or cuts priced into market expectations \(derived from futures and options\). A side panel shows the corresponding "dot plot" for comparison. <p> It's a quick way to see how markets are pricing in Fed policy over the next several years.
  - Bloomberg Terminal / graph \(`GP`\) ::@:: The terminal's built‑in chart editor lets users overlay multiple securities, add technical studies, and export custom visualizations. Sub‑features include editing line charts, adjusting time frames \(1D to YTD\), and incorporating BQL queries for advanced data pulls.
- FINA 3810
  - FINA 3810 / Bloomberg Global Trading Challenge ::@:: Teams of 3–5 students receive a \$1 million USD simulation, trade in equities, fixed income, FX, and derivatives via the terminal, and submit orders through the same interface used by professionals. <p> Weekly rankings are posted, and final winners are announced after five weeks of trading, providing hands‑on experience with real‑time market dynamics.
  - FINA 3810 / value ::@:: It is the intrinsic worth of an asset as calculated from its fundamentals—cash‑flow projections, growth prospects, risk profile, and economic environment \(e.g., discounted‑cash‑flow, earnings multiples\). It represents what a rational investor would be willing to pay for that future stream of benefits.
  - FINA 3810 / price ::@:: Price is the current market price at which the asset trades. It is driven by supply and demand forces: traders' expectations, sentiment, liquidity, momentum, and macro news can push the price above or below its intrinsic value.
  - FINA 3810 / idea generation ::@:: Develop an original trading plan—or adapt a concept you've encountered in earlier coursework, books, or industry publications—by outlining how you choose securities. Explain whether you rely on quantitative factors, technical chart signals, or trending themes \(for instance, artificial intelligence or electric‑vehicle sectors\) to identify potential trades.
- Bloomberg Terminal
  - Bloomberg Terminal / equity screening
  - Bloomberg Terminal / watchlist analytics
  - Bloomberg Terminal / equity backtesting \(`EQBT`\) ::@:: Type __`EQBT <GO>`__ to launch Bloomberg's Equity‑Backtesting platform. From the main screen you can build or load a back‑test model: select a security universe, define strategy rules \(e.g., factor‑based weighting, momentum screens\), set rebalancing frequency and risk‑management constraints, then click "Run". The terminal will simulate trades over the chosen period, displaying performance metrics such as cumulative return, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and comparison against a benchmark index. Results can be exported or saved for further analysis.
  - Bloomberg Terminal / idea generation ::@:: `DAYB`: Bloomberg Daybreak <br/> `ECO`: economic calendar <br/> `EVT`: event calendar <br/> `MAG`: Bloomberg magazines <br/> `N`: news & research <br/> `TSIG`: trading signal
  - Bloomberg Terminal / company model builder \(`MODL`\) ::@:: Enter __`MODL <GO>`__ to open Bloomberg's Company‑Model Builder, where you can construct a customized valuation model for an equity. Select the target security, then pick from built‑in templates \(DCF, relative valuation, earnings growth\) or build your own by adding input assumptions such as revenue CAGR, margin, discount rate, and terminal multiple. After setting the period and any scenario parameters, run the model to generate key outputs—NPV, equity value per share, and sensitivity charts—which can be exported or integrated into research reports.
  - Bloomberg Terminal / equity relative evaluation \(`EQRV`\) ::@:: Type __`EQRV <GO>`__ to bring up Bloomberg's Equity‑Relative‑Valuation screen. The terminal lists the chosen security alongside its peer group and shows key valuation multiples—P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/B, etc.—for each company. You can filter by industry or region, add custom metrics, and view a side‑by‑side table that highlights whether the target is trading at a premium or discount to peers. The charting panel also lets you plot the multiples over time to spot trends in relative valuation.
    - Bloomberg Terminal / equity relative evaluation / use ::@:: It lets traders spot mispriced stocks by benchmarking a company's key multiples—such as P/E or EV/EBITDA—against its peer set \(of similar company lifecycle\). <p> If the target trades at a lower multiple while fundamentals remain similar, it may signal an undervalued entry point; conversely, a higher multiple could indicate a potential sell‑off or risk of overvaluation. <p> By integrating EQRV into a screening workflow, traders can quickly filter for outliers that fit their strategy and use the relative metrics to confirm trade timing, position sizing, and exit levels.
- FINA 3810
  - FINA 3810 / Bloomberg Global Trading Challenge
    - FINA 3810 / Bloomberg Global Trading Challenge / tips ::@:: In the Bloomberg Global Trading Challenge, slippage and commissions are zero, so liquidity concerns disappear and high‑turnover strategies can thrive—especially in small caps that often produce large anomalies. <p> Because risk‑adjusted return isn't mandatory, traders may focus on raw gains: use technical patterns \(price/volume momentum\) or a more data‑driven approach, such as exploiting equity‑option implied moves around US earnings releases for statistical edge. However, back‑testing alone can be misleading since market dynamics and correlations with bonds can shift over time, so strategies should be validated in real‑time rather than purely on historical performance.
  - FINA 3810 / narrative ::@:: A compelling stock pitch blends a clear narrative—why the company matters and what problem it solves—with hard data that backs every claim. Numbers \(earnings, growth rates, valuation multiples\) give the story credibility and allow analysts to see how assumptions translate into returns; the narrative ties those figures together, frames risk, and shows why the investment fits an investor's strategy.
  - FINA 3810 / sources ::@:: Bloomberg Terminal, Webb-site Reports \(<https://webb-site.com/\>), Wind Terminal, etc.
- Bloomberg Terminal
  - Bloomberg Terminal / graph
    - Bloomberg Terminal / graph / normalize ::@:: In the Y‑axis options choose "Normalize" to set all series to a common base \(e.g., 100% on a chosen date\). This lets you compare relative performance rather than absolute price levels.

- FINA 3810
  - FINA 3810 / survey
- [investment management](../../../../general/investment%20management.md) ::@:: It is the professional asset management of various securities, including shareholdings, bonds, and other assets, such as real estate, to meet specified investment goals for the benefit of investors.
  - investment management / cycle ::@:: idea generation → price discovery → execution → portfolio management → \(repeat\)
    - investment management / cycle / idea generation ::@:: use Bloomberg's idea‑generation tools \(e.g. `BI`, `EQS`\) to identify potential buy or sell signals based on fundamental, technical, or macro indicators
    - investment management / cycle / price discovery ::@:: pull company fundamentals \(`FA`\), consensus estimates \(`ANR`\), and risk metrics; assess financial health through ratio analysis, segment revenue breakdowns, and ESG scores
    - investment management / cycle / execution ::@:: place orders via the __`TMSG`__ execution function, monitor real‑time market depth, and use news feeds to stay abreast of earnings releases or corporate actions
    - investment management / cycle / portfolio management ::@:: track portfolio performance with the Portfolio Engine \(`PORT`\), compare realized vs. target returns, and rebalance as needed
- Bloomberg Terminal
  - Bloomberg Terminal / company model builder
  - Bloomberg Terminal / analyst recommendations \(`ANR`\) ::@:: Type __`ANR <GO>`__ into the Bloomberg command line. The screen will list all analysts covering the security, their current rating \(Buy/Hold/Sell\), consensus target price, and expected one‑year return. You can filter by analyst house or region, view historical rating changes, and export the data to Excel for further analysis. This tool lets you gauge market sentiment and compare your valuation against what professional researchers are recommending.
  - Bloomberg Terminal / chart \(`CHAR`\) ::@:: Type __`CHAR <GO>`__ into the Bloomberg command line. The Chart screen opens, where you can select the security, time frame \(e.g., 1‑day, 3‑month, YTD\), and technical indicators \(moving averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands\). Use the toolbar to add overlays, change chart types \(candlestick, line, point‑and‑figure\), or plot multiple securities for comparison. Once satisfied, you can save the chart layout, export it as an image, or embed it in a research report. This function is the quick way to visualize price action and test technical hypotheses directly on Bloomberg.
  - Bloomberg Terminal / document search, technical analysis \(`DS TA`\) ::@:: Enter `DS` followed by `TA` \(Document Search – Technical Analysis\) and hit `<GO>`. The screen displays all Bloomberg‑published research, news releases, and technical analysis documents that match your query or the selected security. You can filter by date range, source, and document type, preview PDFs directly in the terminal, and use the "Export" button to download the full text for offline reading. It's useful for quickly gathering analyst commentary, earnings notes, or market‑wide research without leaving Bloomberg.
  - Bloomberg Terminal / equity relative evaluation
    - Bloomberg Terminal / equity relative evaluation / peers ::@:: When building a comps analysis, pick peers that belong either to an analyst‑curated valuation group or are pulled from Bloomberg's Industry Classification System \(BICS\). You can also switch between other data menus to compare your security with alternative sets of comparables. The default source is "Analyst Curated \(BI\)", which provides a ready‑made peer list for benchmarking performance against rivals.
    - Bloomberg Terminal / equity relative evaluation / blended forward \(BF\) ::@:: __Blended forward__ \(__BF__\) refers to the average of two consecutive forecast periods—typically current year's actual earnings plus next year's analyst estimate. It smooths a single‑year forward figure by blending it with an adjacent period, reducing volatility from one‑time events. <p> A __blended forward multiple__ is simply that BF value divided into a valuation metric \(e.g., P/E or EV/EBITDA\).
    - Bloomberg Terminal / equity relative evaluation / implied price ::@:: It is the theoretical market value of a security that results from applying an intrinsic valuation metric \(such as a blended‑forward P/E or EV/EBITDA\) to its current earnings, cash flow, or revenue figure. <p> By multiplying the forecasted fundamental \(e.g., next‑year EPS\) by the multiple you believe is fair \(e.g. historical average of multiples\), you obtain the price at which the market should be trading if that valuation were correct. <p> It provides a quick benchmark for comparing the actual share price against what your valuation model suggests it ought to be.
- FINA 3810
  - FINA 3810 / trading strategy report ::@:: Develop a clear _process_ to invest with _reasons_. You should be able to explain your idea generation \(5%\) and use Bloomberg tools for price discovery \(5%\). <p> Join a 1-to-5 student group before 2025-10-02, or your group will contain 1 person only.

  - Bloomberg Terminal / relative valuation \(`RV`\) ::@:: Type `RV` into Bloomberg and press `<GO>`. The Relative Valuation screen lets you pick a target company, select a benchmark set \(peer group, industry, or custom list\), and choose the multiple to compare—P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/B, etc. Bloomberg then shows the firm's current ratio, the average of the peers, the "premium to comps" \(difference as a %\), and an implied price range based on that premium. You can also view historical multiples and download the data for further analysis. <p> This is the quickest way to see whether a stock is over‑ or under‑priced relative to its peers.
  - Bloomberg Terminal / earnings estimates \(`EE`\) ::@:: Enter `EE` and hit `<GO>` for the Earnings Estimates screen. Bloomberg pulls all analyst forecasts for key metrics—EPS \(GAAP & adjusted\), revenue, growth rates—and displays them as mean, median, high/low, and standard deviation. The page also shows recent revisions, consensus trends, and a 12‑month earnings timeline. Use it to gauge market expectations, spot significant forecast changes, or compare actual results against the consensus before making investment decisions.
  - Bloomberg Terminal / ESG analysis \(`ESG`\) ::@:: Type `ESG` and press `<GO>`. The ESG screen displays Bloomberg's sustainability score for the selected company, breaking it into Environmental, Social, and Governance components, plus climate‑risk exposure and regulatory ratings \(EU SFDR, EUTAXO\). You can view historical trends, compare your firm to peers, or drill down into specific disclosures such as carbon emissions or board diversity. Exporting the data lets you incorporate ESG metrics into a broader valuation or risk model.
  - Bloomberg Terminal / summary market news \(`SMNR`\) ::@:: Type `SMNR` and hit `<GO>`. The Summary Market News screen gives you a concise, real‑time snapshot of major headlines across global markets—equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities—and highlights any significant events or market movers. You can filter by region, sector, or news source, click through to the full Bloomberg story, and even export the list for later review. It's a quick way to stay updated on market‑moving news without scrolling through endless feeds.
