### content

- rating: C

Yes, it does talk about data science, but it's not very in depth, more like an overview. You can probably expect half of the lessons to learn very basic stuff like the definition of data, knowledge, information, and wisdom. There's no exam anyway so you can probably just ignore all of these information.

The other half of the lessons is literally how to use Excel. I did learn a few new functionalities, but otherwise it's not something you need to specifically go to a course to learn about. An Internet search would do.

Overall, there is little value in the content of the course. Unless you really need that Excel tutoring.

### teaching

- rating: B

Skipped a lot of the lessons because honestly I am not THAT interested into it. From the lessons that I have attended, the teaching is fine. I could see Wilson exerting some effort. And he was willing to answer questions after the lessons.

### grading

- rating: A

DI/PA/F grading, so it does not count towards your CGA.

It does not count attendance so yay! No need to attend the stupid lessons. Though that probably depends on the instructor.

Completing the assignments and the final project (more like an essay) would probably give you a pass. The assignments are simple to get high marks, at least compared to other courses. The teacher also do not expect much from the final project, so it is also easy to get a passing mark there.

Somehow got DI at the end.

### workload

- rating: C

Attendance is not counted, so no workload there. The assignments, as mentioned, are very simple. It takes at most an hour to complete each of them. The final project does require effort and creativity as you need to think of a topic and do some actual data analytics, and write a report that is not more than 5 pages. Since this is a 1 cred course, the final project workload is comparatively high.

Though for me, I wasted 3 days on the final project and it felt more like a LANG writing assignment. Not recommended!
