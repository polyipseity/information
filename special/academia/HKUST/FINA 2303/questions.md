>
> 1. yes

> Similar types of investment opportunities will pay 10%.
>
> Should you accept this investment and why?
>
> 1. yes

> - solution: {@{2}@}
> - explanation: {@{$PV(B) = \frac {50\,000} {10\%} \left(1 - \frac 1 {(1 + 10\%)^6} \right) \approx 217763.035 \,,$ which is less than $PV(C) = 220\,000$.}@} <!--SR:!2026-05-17,350,362!2026-06-12,356,322-->

> 1. Option 1
