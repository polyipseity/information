>
> 1. yes

> Similar types of investment opportunities will pay 10%.
>
> Should you accept this investment and why?
>
> 1. yes
> 2. no

> - solution: {@{2}@}
> - explanation: {@{$PV(B) = \frac {50\,000} {10\%} \left(1 - \frac 1 {(1 + 10\%)^6} \right) \approx 217763.035 \,,$ which is less than $PV(C) = 220\,000$.}@} <!--SR:!2025-05-27,73,342!2025-06-19,85,302-->

>
> You can borrow from the bank at an interest rate of 15%.
>
> 1. Option 1
> 2. Option 2
>
> - solution: {@{1}@}
> - explanation: {@{The PV of costs for option 2: $$PV(C_2) = \frac {15\,000} {0.15} \left(1 - \frac 1 {1.15^4} \right) \approx 42\,824.6754 \,$$ which is more than the PV of costs for option 1, which is simply $40&nbsp;000.}@}

> Q1. Which is the correct method to account for depreciation expenses in computing incremental cash flow?
>
> 1. EBIT = incremental gross profit – depreciation <br/> taxes = EBIT × corporate marginal tax rate <br/> incremental free cash flow = EBIT – taxes + depreciation
> 2. EBIT = incremental gross profit <br/> taxes = EBIT × corporate marginal tax rate <br/> incremental free cash flow = EBIT – taxes
>
> - solution: {@{1}@}
