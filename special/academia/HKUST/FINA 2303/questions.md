>
> 1. yes
> 2. no
>
> - solution: {@{2}@}
> - explanation: {@{The price, when evaluated at any time, is always the same. However, the price represents the present value at the _time of evaluation_, so this means...}@} <!--SR:!2025-03-15,16,322!2025-03-16,17,322-->

>
> 1. PV of an ordinary annuity

>
> Similar types of investment opportunities will pay 10%.
>
> Should you accept this investment and why?
>
> 1. yes
> 2. no
>
> - solution: {@{2}@}
> - explanation: {@{$PV(B) = \frac {50\,000} {10\%} \left(1 - \frac 1 {(1 + 10\%)^6} \right) \approx 217763.035 \,,$ which is less than $PV(C) = 220\,000$.}@} <!--SR:!2025-03-15,16,322!2025-03-26,21,282-->

## week 3 lecture

>
> 1. 2%
> 2. 4%
> 3. 6%
> 4. Cannot be determined
>
> - solution: {@{2}@} <!--SR:!2025-03-21,16,333-->

> Q3. An annuity pays an annual payment with a 5% increase annually in its payments for the next 10 years. To find out its value, we should compute the difference between
>
> 1. PV of a 10 year growing annuity with payment starting in year 1 and PV of a growing perpetuity with payment starting in year 11
> 2. PV of a growing perpetuity with payment starting now and PV of a 10 year annuity with payment starting in year 10
> 3. PV of a growing perpetuity with payment starting in year 1 and PV of a growing perpetuity with payment starting in year 11
> 4. PV of a growing perpetuity with payment starting in year 0 and PV of a growing perpetuity with payment starting in year 11
>
> - solution: {@{3}@}
> - explanation: {@{Note that the option says "payment starting", which is one year after the annuity starts.}@} <!--SR:!2025-03-21,16,333!2025-03-21,16,333-->

> Q4. Suppose your firm needs to purchase a new forklift. The dealer offers you two options:

>
> You can borrow from the bank at an interest rate of 15%.
>
> 1. Option 1
> 2. Option 2
>
> - solution: {@{1}@}
> - explanation: {@{The PV of costs for option 2: $$PV(C_2) = \frac {15\,000} {0.15} \left(1 - \frac 1 {1.15^4} \right) \approx 42\,824.6754 \,$$ which is more than the PV of costs for option 1, which is simply $40&nbsp;000.}@}
> - annotation: What if you do not have enough money right now? In that case, you should {@{still choose the same option, but you borrow money from the bank instead}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-21,16,333!2025-03-17,12,313!2025-03-19,14,313-->
