> You hold the following bond:
>
> - coupon rate: 6% annually, redeem semiannually
> - time to maturity: 10 years
>
> The current market rate is 5% \(APR\). 2 years later, its yield to maturity \(usually quoted in APR in this course\) is 3%. What is your capital gain rate?

>
> - solution: {@{about 12.433199%}@}
> - explanation: {@{Assume the par value is \$1. The current price of the bond is: $$\frac {0.03} {0.025} \left(1 - \frac 1 {{1.025}^{20} } \right) + \frac 1 {{1.025}^{20} } \approx \$1.07794581 \,.$$ The price after 2 years is: $$\frac {0.03} {0.015} \left(1 - \frac 1 {{1.015}^{16} } \right) + \frac 1 {{1.015}^{16} } \approx \$1.21196896 \,.$$ The capital gain rate is $$\frac {1.21196896 - 1.07794581} {1.07794581} \approx 0.12433199 = 12.433199\% \,.$$}@} <!--SR:!2025-06-29,14,290!2025-06-30,15,290-->

> __question 6__
>
> The required rate of return is 10%. If your company has an annual investment return of 25% and a dividend growth rate of 12.5%, how much of the annual earnings are paid out as dividends?

> - solution: {@{50%}@}
> - annotation: {@{It is okay that the dividend growth rate exceeds the required rate of return. However, the dividend discount model does not work in this case: you would get negative stock price.}@} <!--SR:!2025-06-29,14,290!2025-07-01,16,290-->
