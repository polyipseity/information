## week 1 lecture 2

- datetime: 2025-02-07T16:30:00+08:00/2025-02-07T17:50:00+08:00
- topic: time value of money (TVM)
- [time value of money](../../../../general/time%20value%20of%20money.md) ::@:: It refers to the fact that there is normally a greater benefit to receiving a sum of money now rather than an identical sum later. It may be seen as an implication of the later-developed concept of time preference.
  - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis ::@:: Consider the _present value_ cost and benefits of a decision. If cost is larger than benefit, then _reject_. If cost is smaller than benefit, then _accept_. Otherwise, you usually still _accept_ the decision.
    - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis / example ::@:: Your company needs to make a decision. How should the managers decide whether to proceed or not? <p> Identify the _present value_ costs and benefits.
    - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis / present value costs ::@:: e.g. additional maintenance, construction costs, increase in labor costs, land purchase
    - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis / present value benefits ::@:: e.g. better volume discounts, increased profit/margins, increased scales
    - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis / present value ::@:: The best way to compute this is converting the costs and benefit in terms of _cash today_, e.g. _current_ market prices.
- [valuation](../../../../general/valuation%20(finance).md) ::@:: the process of determining the value of a (potential) investment, asset, or security
  - valuation / principle ::@:: objective: to maximize value <p> steps: Identify costs and benefits. Convert costs and benefits into _today's_ cash, e.g. using _current_ market prices. Compare costs and benefits to decide if you accept the decision. The calculated number is _net present value_ (NPV).
    - valuation / principle / irrelevant values ::@:: They include your future expectations (e.g. the value would increase), your personal preferences (e.g. preferring A over B, even though the market price of A is lower than B). <p> Two points to note: <br/> 1. Market prices reflect the average preference of everyone for an item. Even if you value it higher or lower, you still buy/sell using the market price. So only market prices matter. <br/> 2. Your future expectations do not matter since you are making the decision _now_. For example, if you expect the price of an item will increase, and it does increase later such that it changes your decision, you will make such a decision _in the future_. But your _current_ decision is still unaffected.
- [law of one price](../../../../general/law%20of%20one%20price.md) ::@:: In the absence of trade frictions (such as transport costs and tariffs), and under conditions of free _competition_ and price flexibility (where no individual sellers or buyers have power to manipulate prices and prices can freely adjust), _identical goods_ sold at _different locations_ should be sold for the _same price_ when prices are expressed in a common currency.
  - law of one price / mechanism ::@:: This law is derived from the assumption of the inevitable _elimination of all arbitrage_.
- [arbitrage](../../../../general/arbitrage.md) ::@:: The practice of taking advantage of a difference in prices in two or more markets – striking a combination of matching deals to capitalize on the difference, the profit being the difference between the market prices at which the unit is traded.
  - arbitrage / effect ::@:: Arbitrage has the effect of causing prices of the same or very similar assets in different markets to converge.
- [interest rate](../../../../general/interest%20rate.md) ::@:: It is the amount of interest due per period, as a proportion of the amount lent, deposited, or borrowed (called the principal sum).
  - interest rate / time value of money ::@:: Assume you have a _risk-free_ investment that has a certain interest rate, e.g. depositing in banks. Since it is _risk-free_, the return is guaranteed. <p> So the time value of money over time increases. Compare 1 dollar _now_ vs 1 dollar _later_. The 1 dollar now can be invested in this _risk-free_ investment to earn more in the future. So 1 dollar _now_ is more worth than 1 dollar _later_. <p> By this, given a certain amount of money _now_, we can use the _risk-free_ interest rate to compute its _future_ time value. In reverse, given a certain amount of money _in the future_, we can use the _risk-free_ interest rate to compute its _present_ time value, doing the reversed operation.
    - interest rate / time value of money / aliases ::@:: cost of capital, discount rate, hurdle rate, interest rate, opportunity cost of capital, required rate of return
  - interest rate / _risk-free_ interest rate, discount rate, $r_f$ ::@:: The interest rate at which money can be borrowed or lent without risk. By depositing money, we convert money today into money in the future. By borrowing money, we exchange money in the future for money today.
  - interest rate / interest rate factor ::@:: It is the rate of exchange _from_ dollars today _to_ dollars in the future, calculated as $(1 + r_f)^t$.
  - interest rate / discount factor ::@:: It is the rate of exchange between dollars _from_ the future _to_ dollars today, calculated as $1 / (1 + r_f)^t$.
  - interest rate / negative ::@:: Nominal interest rate cannot be negative: you can always just save the money as cash to avoid the negative nominal interest rate. Real interest rate can be negative, which happens if inflation is higher than nominal interest rate.
- [net present value](../../../../general/net%20present%20value.md) (NPV) ::@:: net present value (NPV) = present value (benefits/cash inflows) − present value (costs/cash outflows)

  - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis
- finance
  - finance / valuation principles
- law of one price
- time value of money
  - time value of money / timeline ::@:: This tool can visualize cash inflows and outflows easily. It is a number line staring from time 0 on the left. Label cash inflows (positive; e.g. return), cash outflows (negative; e.g. investments), and their amounts under the number line.
  - time value of money / future value ::@:: Move the cash flow forward in time: $FV = PV \cdot (1 + r)^t$, where $t$ is the number of time periods forward (beware of off-by-one error).
    - time value of money / future value / compounding ::@:: Future value uses compound interest instead of simple interest. In the former, interest is earned on principal only. In the latter, interest is earned on principal and interest received. <p> Given a long enough time, compound interest gives much money money than simple interest. On a graph, compound interest increases exponentially while simple interest increases linearly.
  - time value of money / present value ::@:: Move the cash flow backward in time: $PV = \frac {FV} {(1 + r)^t}$, where $t$ is the number of time periods backwards (beware of off-by-one error).
  - time value of money / combining cash flow ::@:: Only cash flows at the same time can be added together. Cash flows at different time must be converted to cash flows at the same time by either compounding or discounting cash flows.
- [financial calculator](../../../../general/financial%20calculator.md)
  - financial calculator / common acronyms ::@:: CPT: compute (compute the missing value from the other 4 values), FV: future value, N: number of periods, I: interest rate per period (in percentage), PMT: annuity payment, PV: present value
  - financial calculator / hints ::@:: Remember to clear out registers between different questions. <br/> Interest rate is usually in percentage. Avoid rounding off intermediate values: use registers to store values. <br/> Negative values are cash outflows while positive values are cash inflows.
- time value of money
  - time value of money / finding number of periods ::@:: $N = \frac {\ln(FV / PV)} {\ln(1 + r)} = \frac {\ln FV - \ln PV} {\ln(1 + r)}$, which has units of period (usually year)
  - time value of money / finding interest rate ::@:: $r = (FV / PV)^{1 / N} - 1$
- [rule of 72](../../../../general/rule%20of%2072.md) (or 70 or 69.3) ::@:: How long does it take to double your investment? This rule gives a rough approximation. <p> The rule states, to double your investment, the interest rate per period in _percentage_ multiplied by the number of periods should be approximately 72.

- topic: time value of money: valuing cash flow streams
- time value of money
  - time value of money / timeline
  - time value of money / combining cash flow
  - time value of money / multiple cash flows ::@:: annuity (annuity due, ordinary annuity), perpetuity; growing annuity, growing perpetuity
- [perpetuity](../../../../general/perpetuity.md) ::@:: It is an annuity that has no end, or a stream of cash payments that continues forever.
  - perpetuity / intuition ::@:: You want to earn $C$ at the end of each year forever (excluding year 0). <p> Assuming the interest rate $r$ is fixed. Then you need to invest $P = C / r$ at year 0. This $P$ is also how one calculates the present value of a perpetuity.
  - perpetuity / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = C / r$$ <p> This equation assumes the first payment is at first year end. Multiply by $1 + r$ if the first payment is at first year start, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period.
  - perpetuity / present value ::@:: Notice that the present value is always the same when evaluated at any time.
- [annuity](../../../../general/annuity.md) ::@:: It is a series of payments made at equal intervals.
  - annuity / types ::@:: ordinary annuity: payment is made at period end, annuity due: payment is made at period start
  - annuity / relation to perpetuity ::@:: You can interpret as an annuity as a perpetuity that you transfer away to others for free at annuity end (after getting the cash flow for annuity end). <p> This gives the equation for an annuity directly by subtracting the PV of the perpetuity at annuity end from the PV of perpetuity at annuity start.
  - annuity / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = \frac C r \left(1 - \frac 1 {(1 + r)^t} \right) \,,$$ where $t$ is the number of periods. <p> This equation assumes the annuity is an ordinary annuity. For annuity due, multiply by $1 + r$, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period.
  - annuity / equation for FV ::@:: Just multiply the PV formula by $(1 + r)^t$, where $t$ is the number of periods in the future. This is because the annuity has the same value as a lump-sum of PV amount. <p> This changes the above equation to: $$FV = \frac C r \left((1 + r)^t - 1 \right) \,,$$ if $FV$ is evaluated at the annuity end.
  - annuity / note ::@:: If a question does not explicitly mention if an annuity is ordinary or due, assume ordinary.

- topic: time value of money: valuing cash flow streams
- perpetuity
  - perpetuity / equation for PV
- annuity
  - annuity / equation for PV
  - annuity / equation for FV
- perpetuity
  - perpetuity / growing ::@:: The payment grows exponentially instead of staying constant. It continues forever. <p> More precisely, the first payment starts at $C$, and then each year after it grows by $g$ (multiplied by $1 + g$).
    - perpetuity / growing / intuition ::@:: Recall the intuition for non-growing perpetuity. <p> Then for growing perpetuity, your earnings grows by $g$ (multiplied by $1 + g$) each year after the first year. That means the principal in the fund will need to grow by $g$ as well. That means the interest you have earned on the principal needs to be separated into two parts: one to grow the principal by $g$, the other to provide the payment. The payment you actually obtain is $r - g$ of the principal then. <p> You want to earn $C$ at the end of each year forever (excluding year 0). Assuming the interest rate $r$ is fixed. Then you need to invest $P = C / (r - g)$ at year 0. This $P$ is also how one calculates the present value of a growing perpetuity.
    - perpetuity / growing / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = \frac C {r - g}$$ <p> This equation assumes the first payment is at first year end. Multiply by $1 + r$ if the first payment is at first year start, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period.
    - perpetuity / growing / present value ::@:: Notice that the present value is _not_ always the same when evaluated at any time. Rather, it grows by $g$ (multiplied by $1 + g$) each year.
- annuity
  - annuity / growing ::@:: The payment grows exponentially instead of staying constant. It ends after some time. <p> More precisely, the first payment starts at $C$, and then each year after it grows by $g$ (multiplied by $1 + g$), until the annuity ends.
    - annuity / growing / relation to perpetuity ::@:: The relation is exactly the same, but with growing payments instead of constant payments.
    - annuity / growing / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = \frac C {r - g} \left(1 - \frac {(1 + g)^t} {(1 + r)^t} \right) \,,$$ where $t$ is the number of periods. <p> This equation assumes the annuity is an ordinary annuity. For annuity due, multiply by $1 + r$, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period.
    - annuity / growing / equation for FV ::@:: Just multiply the PV formula by $(1 + r)^t$, where $t$ is the number of periods in the future. This is because the growing annuity has the same value as a lump-sum of PV amount. <p> This changes the above equation to: $$FV = \frac C {r - g} \left((1 + r)^t - (1 + g)^t \right) \,,$$ if $FV$ is evaluated at the annuity end.
- time value of money
  - time value of money / rearranging formulas ::@:: Note that the formulas can be used flexibly. That is, it can be used for more than finding the variable at LHS. In fact, if you have all variables except for one, you can rearrange the equations to find the missing variable. <p> However, there are exceptions not having closed-form algebraic expressions... Interest rate is one of them.
- annuity
  - annuity / finding cash flow ::@:: Rearrange the formulas appropriately to find the cash flow/payment. Actually it is too simple that I will not list the equation here...
  - annuity / finding interest rate ::@:: As mentioned above, there is no closed-form algebraic expression for finding the interest rate from other variables. <p> You can either use a financial calculator, or do trial-and-error (which is what calculators are doing behind the scenes...).
    - annuity / finding interest rate / financial calculator ::@:: Simple, just fill in the other variables _properly_ and leave out the interest rate...
    - annuity / finding interest rate / trial-and-error ::@:: Using intuition, guess an interest rate. Calculate the value for another variable assuming that interest rate. Observe the error between the actual value of that other variable. Using intuition, guess if the interest rate needs to be higher or lower, and by how much. Repeat until you get a good enough answer. <p> (The instructor told us that we will not need to calculate the exact value... But we still need to know how to guess.)
  - annuity / finding number of periods ::@:: Given present value (money you have now) $PV$, future value (money to save) $PV$, interest rate $r$, and _ordinary_ annuity payment $C$, we can derive the equation for number of periods $t$: $$\begin{aligned} FV & = PV (1 + r)^t + \frac C r \left((1 + r)^t - 1 \right) \\ (1 + r)^t & = \frac {FV + \frac C r} {PV + \frac C r} = \frac {r \cdot FV + C} {r \cdot PV + C} \\ t & = \frac {\ln(r \cdot FV + C) - \ln(r \cdot PV + C)} {\ln(1 + r)} \,. \end{aligned}$$ So the equation is the last expression, for those without a financial calculator.
    - annuity / finding number of periods / intuition ::@:: Observe the equation: $$t = \frac {\ln(r \cdot FV + C) - \ln(r \cdot PV + C)} {\ln(1 + r)} \,.$$ You can see $r \cdot FV + C$ would have been the next payment after the annuity ends if the annuity had not ended. $r \cdot PV + C$ is the first payment. This is interesting... it seems like it somehow relates to the growth...

- topic: interest rates
- interest rate
  - interest rate / quoted in ::@:: annual percentage rate (APR), effective annual rate (EAR); both are _nominal_
- [annual percentage rate](../../../../general/annual%20percentage%20rate.md) (APR) ::@:: the _simple-interest_ rate for a _whole year_ (annualized), rather than just a monthly fee/rate
  - annual percentage rate / prevalence ::@:: It is almost always the rate quoted in industry. <p> _Important_: Unless otherwise specified, interest rates given in questions are always this.
  - annual percentage rate / conversion between durations ::@:: If the time duration is multiplied by $k$, multiply the interest rate by $k$ as well: $$r_{\text{new} } = k r_{\text{old} } \,.$$ <p> Note: APR requires the duration to be a year. If not, it would be just annual \(something\) rate.
  - annual percentage rate / to effective annual rate ::@:: $$\text{EAR} = (1 + \text{APR} / m)^m - 1 \,,$$ where $m$ is the number of compounding in a year.
- [effective annual rate](../../../../general/effective%20interest%20rate.md) (EAR) ::@:: the percentage of interest on a loan or financial product for a _whole year_ if _compound interest_ accumulates in periods different than a year
  - effective annual rate / motivation ::@:: Always use this rather than the other one when comparing interest rates (e.g. annual IRR) for decision-making! It can also be used to value non-annual cash flows.
  - effective annual rate / conversion between durations ::@:: If the time duration is multiplied by $k$ is multiplied by $k$, you need to do an exponentiation: $$r_{\text{new} } = (1 + r_{\text{old} })^k - 1 \,.$$ Importantly, do _not_ simply just multiply by $k$! <p> Note: EAR requires the duration to be a year. If not, it would be just effective interest rate (EIR).
  - effective annual rate / vs. annual percentage rate ::@:: We see that EAR equals APR if the interest rate is compounded annually. Otherwise, EAR > APR if the interest rate is compounded more frequently than annually, and EAR < APR if the interest rate is compounded less frequently than annually.
  - effective annual rate / to annual percentage rate ::@:: $$\text{APR} = m \left((1 + \text{EAR})^{1 / m} - 1\right) \,,$$ where $m$ is the number of compounding in a year.

- topic: interest rates
- annual percentage rate
- effective annual rate
- [amortizing loan](../../../../general/amortizing%20loan.md) ::@:: a loan where the principal of the loan is paid down over the life of the loan (that is, amortized) according to an amortization schedule, typically through equal payments.
  - amortizing loan / equated monthly installment (EMI) ::@:: Payments are divided into equal amounts for the duration of the loan, making it the simplest repayment model. A greater amount of the payment is applied to _interest_ at the beginning of the amortization schedule, while more money is applied to _principal_ at the end.
  - amortizing loan / terminology ::@:: balance/principal outstanding, interest, principal
  - amortizing loan / amortizing schedule ::@:: It can be an Excel spreadsheet showing balance/principal outstanding, interest paid, and principal paid.
  - amortizing loan / intuition ::@:: Literally just ordinary annuity, but the direction of payment is reversed.
  - amortizing loan / equated monthly installment
    - amortizing loan / equated monthly installment / formula ::@:: This is captured by the formula $$P\,=\,A\cdot {\frac {1-\left({\frac {1}{1+r} }\right)^{n} }{r} }$$ or, equivalently, $$A\,=\,P\cdot {\frac {r(1+r)^{n} }{(1+r)^{n}-1} }$$ where: _P_ is the principal amount borrowed, _A_ is the periodic amortization payment, _r_ is the periodic interest rate divided by 100 \(nominal annual interest rate also divided by 12 in case of monthly installments\), and _n_ is the total number of payments \(for a 30-year loan with monthly payments _n_ = 30 × 12 = 360\).
  - amortizing loan / outstanding balance ::@:: You want to find the outstanding loan balance at time _t_. <p> First, assuming EMI, find the installment using the above formulas. Then, you can either consider the _remaining balance_, which is the PV evaluated at time _t_ of the remaining payments, or consider the _outstanding loan_, which is the FV evaluated at time _t_ of the original loan minus the FV evaluated at time _t_ of the paid payments. <p> (The former one seems easier...)
    - amortizing loan / outstanding balance / formula ::@:: Assuming EMI. The outstanding principal at time _t_ is: $$P_t = P_0 \frac {1 - \frac 1 {(1 + r)^{T - t} } } {1 - \frac 1 {(1 + r)^T } } \,,$$ where _P_<sub>0</sub> is the \(original\) principal, _r_ is the interest rate, and _T_ is the total number of payments (paid _and_ remaining).
- [opportunity cost of capital](../../../../general/cost%20of%20capital.md) ::@:: It is the cost of a company's funds (both debt and equity), or from an investor's point of view is "the required rate of return on a portfolio company's existing securities". <p> It is the best available expected return offered in the market on an investment of _comparable risk and term_ to the cash flows being discounted.
  - opportunity cost of capital / risk-free return ::@:: Many investors consider US Treasury bonds as "risk-free". Thus for any borrowing that is not considered "risk-free", investors require a higher rate of return.

- topic: investment decision rules
- investment decision rules ::@:: Rules for making investments, _usually_ to maximize value.
  - investment decision rules / project types ::@:: standalone projects, mutually exclusive projects, mix of the above
- standalone project ::@:: discounted payback period, internal rate of return, net present value, payback period, etc.
- mutually exclusive project ::@:: duration \(lives\) difference, scale difference, timing difference, etc.
- net present value
  - net present value / interpretation ::@:: Zero NPV (cf. _normal profit_ in economics) allows us to recover invested capital (i.e. no loss) and receive return on capital (i.e. return comparable with the market interest rate). Positive NPV (cf. _abnormal profit_ in economics) _additionally_ allows us to create _value_ for investors (i.e. extra return above the market interest rate).
    - net present value / interpretation / zero NPV ::@:: From an economics standpoint, in a _perfectly_ competitive/efficient market, there should not be any abnormal profit, i.e. no investments with positive NPV. Investments are either zero or negative NPV. So you _should accept_ zero NPV projects unless you have good \(non-financial\) reasons to not to. <p> \(Of course, the real world is not _perfectly_ competitive/efficient...\)
  - net present value / decision rule ::@:: For standalone projects \(i.e. either take or leave\), _accept_ positive NPV projects. _Reject_ negative NPV projects. _Accept_ zero NPV projects unless you have good \(non-financial\) reasons to not to, for the reasons described above. <p> To choose among mutually exclusive projects, choose the alternative with the _highest non-negative_ NPV. If all projects have negative NPV, then _reject all_.
  - net present value / NPV profile ::@:: It is a _xy_-plot that, given a cost of capital, shows the NPV of an investment or loan/delayed investment. The point where the graph crosses _y_ = 0 (zero NPV) has an _x_ value that is the _internal rate of return_ (IRR). <p> For an investment, the graph is decreasing. For a loan/delayed investment, the graph is increasing. <p> Note that for unconventional cash flows, all of the above (include increasing/decreasing graphs) may not be true. In fact, it is possible to have multiple points where the graph crosses _y_ = 0, yielding _multiple IRRs_.
    - net present value / NPV profile / multiple IRRs ::@:: There can be as many IRRs as the number of times the cash flows change sign. For conventional cash flows \(investment or loan/delayed investment\), this is at most one.
- investment decision rules
  - investment decision rules / investment vs. loan/delayed investment ::@:: The former refers to all cash outflows being before any cash inflows. The latter refers to all cash inflows being before any cash outflows.
- [internal rate of return](../../../../general/internal%20rate%20of%20return.md) \(IRR\) ::@:: It is a method of calculating an investment's rate of return. The term _internal_ refers to the fact that the calculation excludes external factors, such as the risk-free rate, inflation, the cost of capital, or financial risk.
  - internal rate of return / application timing ::@:: The method may be applied either ex-post (after) or ex-ante (before). Applied ex-ante, the IRR is an estimate of a future annual rate of return. Applied ex-post, it measures the actual achieved investment return of a historical investment.
  - internal rate of return / definition ::@:: It of an investment or project is the "annualized effective compounded return rate" or rate of return that sets the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows (both positive and negative) from the investment equal to zero.
  - internal rate of return / calculation ::@:: Similar to calculating interest rate, there is no closed formula for it. Either use Microsoft Excel, a financial calculator, or use trial-and-error.
  - internal rate of return / interpretation ::@:: It measures the _average return_ of an investment, or the _average interest rate_ of a loan/delayed investment, independent of the actual interest rate/cost of capital. <p> It also measures the _sensitivity_ of the NPV to measurement errors in the cost of capital. The difference between the cost of capital and the IRR is the error margin: By how much your cost of capital can wrong without changing your decision? \(It applies for both investment and loan/delayed investment.\)
  - internal rate of return / intuition ::@:: It is the discount rate needed to make all cash flows now and in the future to have a net present value of zero. Notice that it does not distinguish between inflow and outflow: Both are discounted by equal amount given that they have the same timing. This means if more inflows are in the farther future, inflows are discounted more. Same goes for outflows. <p> This explains the difference in the decision rules for investment and loan/delayed investment. In the former, the cash flows being discounted are the inflows. Higher IRR means the inflows are worth more to begin with before being discounted. So higher is better. In the latter the cash flows being discounted are the outflows. Higher IRR means the outflows are worth more to begin with before being discounted. So lower is better.
  - internal rate of return / weakness ::@:: It generally cannot be used for non-conventional cash flows (neither an investment nor a loan/delayed investment). <p> For mutually exclusive projects, IRR is _scale-independent_ and _timing-dependent_, so it is not suitable. <p> Since all cash flows are assumed to be discounted at the internal rate of return, this means we are assuming an environment where all cash inflows can be \(re-\)invested at the internal rate of return rather than the cost of capital. For an investment with high IRR, this may over-estimate the return.
  - internal rate of return / decision rule ::@:: For a standalone investment, _accept_ those with an IRR of _at least_ the cost of capital. _Reject_ others. For a standalone loan/delayed investment, _accept_ those with an IRR _not higher than_ the cost of capital. _Reject_ others. These rules are _consistent_ (i.e. make the same decision) as that for NPV, given that projects are of _similar_ _duration_/_life_, _scale_, and _timing_. <p> For non-conventional cash flows (neither an investment nor a loan/delayed investment) or mutually exclusive projects, IRR is generally unsuitable, and we should use NPV or other rules instead. <p> \(__this course__: In the book and the course, the IRR rule is considered reliable _only_ for investment, and this excludes loan/delayed investment.\)
  - internal rate of return / note ::@:: In this course, use the NPV rule instead of IRR rule, even for loan/delayed investment.
- [payback period](../../../../general/payback%20period.md) ::@:: It is the time required to recoup the funds expended in an investment, or to reach the break-even point. <p> It _does not discount_ the cash flows.
  - payback period / decision rule ::@:: First, define a pre-specified length of time is the _maximum payback period_. <p> For a standalone project, if the payback period is _not greater than_ the maximum, _accept_ the project. Otherwise _reject_. <p> This rule is generally _not consistent_ with NPV.
  - payback period / calculation ::@:: Calculate the time required to payback the initial investment. No discounting is done. <p> Alternatively, find out how much is received within the maximum payback period and see if it can payback the initial investment. No discounting is done. <p> \(__this course__: In book, course, and homework, the payback period is calculated assuming cash flows are continuous, i.e. direct division is enough and rounding up is unnecessary.\)
  - payback period / decision rule
    - payback period / decision rule / advantages ::@:: Simple. Favors liquidity.
    - payback period / decision rule / disadvantages ::@:: The maximum payback period/payback period cutoff is arbitrary. Cash flows after the cutoff is ignored. Not necessarily consistent with maximizing shareholder value (since it is not generally consistent with NPV).
- net present value
  - net present value / decision rule
    - net present value / decision rule / advantages ::@:: The impact to the firm's value is calculated. Consistent with maximizing shareholder value (since it is a direct application of the valuation principle).
    - net present value / decision rule / disadvantages ::@:: Can be complicated and time-consuming to calculate. A somewhat accurate interest rate is required.
  - net present value / incremental ::@:: When using incremental NPV to compare two choices, identify which one is the "default" choice. Then the incremental cash flows are computed by subtracting the other choice by the "default" choice. <p> The decision rule is the same.
- internal rate of return
  - internal rate of return / decision rule
    - internal rate of return / decision rule / advantages ::@:: For conventional cash flows, it is consistent with NPV (given duration/life, scale, and timing are _similar_), and thus maximizing shareholder value.
    - internal rate of return / decision rule / disadvantages ::@:: Hard to compute (no closed formula). Cannot be used to choose among mutually exclusive projects \(at least not by directly comparing IRRs\). Can be misleading for loan/delayed investment and projects with unconventional cash flows. There may be _no or multiple IRRs_ (roots in the NPV profile) for unconventional cash flows.
- [discounted payback period](../../../../general/discounted%20payback%20period.md) ::@:: \(untaught\) It is the amount of time that it takes (in years) for the initial cost of a project to equal to the _discounted_ value of expected cash flows, or the time it takes to break even from an investment. It is the period in which the cumulative net present value of a project equals zero. <p> It _does discount_ the cash flows.
- mutually exclusive project
  - mutually exclusive project / scale difference ::@:: NPV measures _total impact on value_ and is scale-dependent. IRR measures _average return_ and is scale-independent. When you scale up a project while keeping everything else the same, NPV scales up proportionally while IRR remains the same. As NPV is consistent with maximizing wealth (as a direct application of the valuation principle), we should use NPV for projects of different scales.

- topic: investment decision rules
- mutually exclusive project
  - mutually exclusive project / scale difference
    - mutually exclusive project / scale difference / using IRR ::@:: What if you want to use IRR for projects of different scales anyway? Assuming both projects have _nonnegative NPV_, use incremental cash flows (larger project cash flows minus smaller project cash flows, including the starting cash flow) instead and compute its internal rate of return. \(The steps and _precautions_ are mentioned below.\)
    - mutually exclusive project / scale difference / NPV profile ::@:: If the projects/investments are of the same scale \(and same timing and same duration\), the NPV graph of the project with a higher IRR is always higher than that with a lower IRR and never intersects. However, if they are of different scales, then the two graphs can intersect each other. This intersection point is known as the _crossover point_, its _x_ value is the cost of capital for which the NPVs of the two projects are equal, and its _y_ value is the corresponding NPV.
- internal rate of return
  - internal rate of return / incremental ::@:: First, ensure that both projects have _nonnegative NPV_. <p> Compute incremental cash flows \(_larger_ project cash flows minus _smaller_ project cash flows, including the starting cash flow\). Check if the cash flows is a normal investment, as opposed to a loan/delayed investment or unconventional cash flows. (If not, see below.) <p> Compute its internal rate of return. This is known as the _crossover point_. If it is higher than or equal to the cost of capital, accept the _larger_ project. Otherwise reject.
    - internal rate of return / incremental / intuition ::@:: Intuitively, the incremental cash flows give the difference if we choose the larger project and giving up the smaller project. Now our decision becomes between accepting the difference and rejecting it. This decision can be considered a standalone project (and it is a normal investment since increment cash outflows are before incremental cash inflows). This difference is worth it if its NPV is nonnegative, assuming both projects have _nonnegative NPV_ \(If both projects have negative NPV, we should reject both!\). So we can use IRR again.
    - internal rate of return / increment / caution ::@:: If you find the cash flow is a loan/delayed investment, you have probably done _smaller_ project cash flow minus _larger_ cash flow. The IRR calculated will be the same, but your decision rule is reversed, i.e. reject the _smaller_ project (accept the _larger_ project) if IRR is higher than or equal to the cost of capital. Otherwise reject <p> If you find the cash flow is unconventional, you should not use the IRR decision rule. Use another one as appropriate, e.g. equivalent annual annuity (EAA/EAC), net present value (NPV), etc. <p> You also need to check if both projects have _nonnegative NPV_. If both projects have negative NPV, we should reject both!
- mutually exclusive project
  - mutually exclusive project / timing difference ::@:: Timing of cash flows affects both NPV and IRR, and in different ways. IRR is more sensitive to timing. It is possible to alter the ranking of projects based on IRR without altering that based on NPV. <p> Thus using IRR is _not_ consistent with using NPV with different timing. In this case, we should always rely on NPV, since it is a direct application of the valuation principle. <p> On a NPV profile, with different timing, it is possible for _crossover points_ to appear even if the two projects have the same scale.
- internal rate of return
  - internal rate of return / decision rule
    - internal rate of return / decision rule / advantages
    - internal rate of return / decision rule / disadvantages
- mutually exclusive project
  - mutually exclusive project / duration difference \(different lives\) ::@:: If two investments last for different durations \(e.g. a service\), computing NPV ignores their useful durations. But this is easily fixed by doing an extra thing: calculating the _equivalent annual annuity_ \(EAA\) that last for the duration of the respective investment. \(Directly dividing the NPV by the duration ignores the _time value of money_.\)
- [equivalent annual cost](../../../../general/equivalent%20annual%20cost.md) \(EAC\) ::@:: It is the cost per year of owning and operating an asset over its entire lifespan.
  - equivalent annual cost / calculation ::@:: It is calculated by dividing the negative [NPV](../../../../general/net%20present%20value.md) of a project by the "present value of [annuity](../../../../general/annuity%20(finance%20theory).md) factor": $$\mathrm {EAC} =-{\frac {\mathrm {NPV} }{A_{t,r} } } \,,$$ where $${A_{t,r} }={\frac {1-{\frac {1}{(1+r)^{t} } } }{r} }$$ where _r_ is the annual interest rate and _t_ is the number of years. <p> Alternatively, EAC can be obtained by multiplying the NPV of the project by the "loan repayment factor".
  - equivalent annual cost / equivalent annual annuity \(EAA\) ::@:: This different naming \(used by the course and the book\) is to reflect that this can be used for more than costs. <p> Note that in this case, the resulting sign is inverted, since we are considering an "annuity" instead of "cost" now.
  - equivalent annual cost / additional considerations ::@:: Consider all available options and possible scenarios beyond replacement cost and required life, e.g. flexibility, risk, etc.

  - [financial accounting § statement of retained earnings](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md#statement%20of%20retained%20earnings) ::@:: Keeps track of issued capital (_dividends_) and _retained earnings_. (Positive) net income (profit minus loss, including taxes and excluding bonus shares and dividends) increases retained earnings, while dividends paid decreases it.
  - [financial accounting § statement of cash flows](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md#statement%20of%20cash%20flows) ::@:: Shows the movement of cash and cash equivalent under _operating_, _investing_, and _financing_ (this categorization may be tested in the examinations) activities of a reporting entity for the reporting period, usually 12 months.

- [accounting equation](../../../../general/accounting%20equation.md) ::@:: $$\text{assets (A)} = \text{liabilities (L)} + \text{stockholders' equity (SE)}$$
- [fixed asset](../../../../general/fixed%20asset.md) ::@:: It is is a term used in accounting for assets and property that may not easily be converted into cash. It may be tangible or intangible, but usually only tangible ones are referred as such; intangible ones are directly referred by a more specific name. <p> IAS 16.6 defines it as _tangible items_ that (a) are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes and (b) are expected to be used during more than one period.
  - tangible asset ::@:: They are assets that have a physical substance. Examples include land (_not_ depreciable), assets subject to _depreciation_, natural resources subject to _depletion_, etc.
  - [intangible asset](../../../../general/intangible%20asset.md) ::@:: It is an asset that lacks physical substance. Definite-life examples include copyrights, franchises, patents, rights-of-use, etc. Indefinite-life examples include goodwill, trademarks, etc.
  - fixed assets / acquisition ::@:: They may be acquired using cash, debt, non-cash methods (e.g. common stock, additional paid-in capital), or a combination of the above.
- [balance sheet](../../../../general/balance%20sheet.md)

  - [balance sheet](../../../../general/balance%20sheet.md) / elements ::@:: titles, name of the financial statement, reporting period or point in time, currency and basis of monetary unit, assets (in decreasing/increasing liquidity), liabilities (in decreasing/increasing maturity)
  - balance sheet / GAAP vs. IFRS ::@:: The former lists current assets/liabilities before non-current assets/liabilities \(decreasing liquidity\). The latter lists non-current assets/liabilities before current assets/liabilities \(increasing liquidity\).
- [historical cost](../../../../general/historical%20cost.md) ::@:: It is the value of the costs incurred in acquiring or creating the asset, comprising the consideration paid to acquire or create the asset plus transaction costs.
  - historical cost / balance sheet ::@:: Balance sheet records amounts measured at historical values and historical exchange rates.
- [depreciation](../../../../general/depreciation.md) ::@:: As fixed assets are used to earn revenue, they become "used". According to the matching principle, an expense should be recorded. <p> To do so, expense "Depreciated account" is debited while contra-asset "Accumulated depreciation" is credited.
- [net book value](../../../../general/book%20value.md) ::@:: $$\text{cost of fixed asset} - \text{corresponding accumulated depreciation}$$
- [goodwill](../../../../general/goodwill%20(accounting).md) ::@:: It is an intangible asset recognized when a firm is purchased as a going concern. It reflects the premium that the buyer pays in addition to the net value of its other assets. It is often understood to represent the firm's intrinsic ability to acquire and retain customer business, where that ability is not otherwise attributable to brand name recognition, contractual arrangements or other specific factors. It is classified as an intangible asset on the balance sheet, since it can neither be seen nor touched.
  - goodwill / creation ::@:: It is recognized only through an acquisition; it cannot be self-created.
- [working capital](../../../../general/working%20capital.md) ::@:: $$\text{current assets (CA)} - \text{current liabilities (CL)}$$
  - working capital / interpretation ::@:: It affects a company's long-term _investment effectiveness_, _financial strength_ to cover short-term liabilities, and represents what a company currently has to finance its _immediate operational needs_, e.g., to pay vendors, acquire inventories etc. <p> Changes in working capital accounts are important to managers & analysts because they have a direct impact on cash flows from _operating activities_. <p> Too much of it may tie up resources in unproductive assets.
- [book value](../../../../general/book%20value.md) ::@:: It is the value of an asset according to its [balance sheet](../../../../general/balance%20sheet.md) account balance. For assets, the value is based on the original cost of the asset less any [depreciation](../../../../general/depreciation.md), [amortization](../../../../general/amortization%20(accounting).md) or [impairment costs](../../../../general/impairment%20cost.md) made against the asset.
  - book value / problems ::@:: They are based on historical cost. Not all assets and liabilities are included. Assets and liabilities may be understated or overstated. Examples include brand value, contingent liabilities, goodwill, patents, etc. <p> Market value provides an alternative way to value a company without the above problems.
- [market value](../../../../general/market%20value.md) ::@:: It is the price at which an asset would trade in a competitive auction setting.
- [equity](../../../../general/equity%20(finance).md) ::@:: It is an ownership interest in property that may be offset by debts or other liabilities.
  - equity / book value ::@:: book value of assets − book value of liabilities; thus it can be negative

- [market capitalization](../../../../general/market%20capitalization.md) ::@:: It is the total value of a publicly traded company's outstanding common shares owned by stockholders.
  - market capitalization / formula ::@:: It equals to the market price per common share multiplied by the number of common shares outstanding. Thus it cannot be negative.
- [enterprise value](../../../../general/enterprise%20value.md) \(EV\) ::@:: It is an economic measure reflecting the market value of a business (i.e. as distinct from market price). It is a sum of claims by all claimants: creditors (secured and unsecured) and shareholders (preferred and common).
  - enterprise value / formula ::@:: enterprise value = <br/> common equity at market value (this line item is also known as "market cap") <br/> + debt at market value (here debt refers to interest-bearing liabilities, both long-term and short-term) <br/> + preferred equity at market value <br/> + unfunded pension liabilities and other debt-deemed provisions <br/> – value of associate companies <br/> – cash and cash equivalents
    - enterprise value / formula / simplified ::@:: enterprise value = common equity at market value + debt at market value – cash and cash equivalents <p> If debt at market value is unavailable, debt at book value may be used instead, though it is less accurate.
  - enterprise value / interpretation ::@:: It is the net cost to take over the business: cost to buy all equity and pay off its debts and receive its cash.

- [earnings per share](../../../../general/earnings%20per%20share.md) \(EPS\) ::@:: $$\frac {\text{net income} - \text{preferred dividends} } {\text{(time-)weighted average outstanding common shares} }$$
  - earnings per share / diluted ::@:: It is a company's earnings per share calculated using fully diluted shares outstanding (i.e. including the impact of stock option grants and convertible bonds). Diluted EPS indicates a "worst case" scenario, one that reflects the issuance of stock for all outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities that would reduce earnings per share.
- [retained earnings](../../../../general/retained%20earnings.md) ::@:: It of a corporation is the accumulated net income of the corporation that is retained by the corporation at a particular point in time, such as at the end of the reporting period.
  - retained earnings / change ::@:: At the end of that period, the net income (or net loss) at that point \(minus _dividends_\) is transferred from the Profit and Loss Account to the retained earnings account.
- [income statement](../../../../general/income%20statement.md) ::@:: It is one of the financial statements of a company and shows the company's revenues and expenses during a particular period.
  - [ACCT 2010/income statement](../ACCT%202010/income%20statement.md)
- [net income](../../../../general/net%20income.md) ::@:: It is an entity's income minus cost of goods sold, expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest, and taxes, and other expenses for an accounting period. \(Dividends are not expenses.\)
  - net income / problems ::@:: It typically does not equal the earned cash and cash equivalents. A firm may be profitable by net income but short of cash and cash equivalents, which is important because it is needed to maintain operations, pay bills, and pay dividends \(return for investors\).
    - net income / problems / sources ::@:: Net income is based on accrual accounting. It also includes non-cash items, e.g. credit sales, depreciation & amortization, etc. Conversion of cash into non-cash is not accounted for, e.g. investment in PPE.
  - net income / conversion to cash ::@:: Identify cash and non-cash items. <p> cash: cash sales, cost of goods sold \(if the corresponding cash cost is converted into goods in the same period\), selling expense, taxes, etc. <br> non-cash: amortization, credit sales, depreciation, etc.
- [cash basis accounting](../../../../general/cash%20method%20of%20accounting) ::@:: Receiving cash or cash equivalents is revenue. Paying cash or cash equivalents is expense. There are no concepts of accruals, deferrals, etc. <p> Usually not used because it presents a distorted and misleading picture. Not relevant for external decision makers. _Not permissible_ under GAAP.
- [accrual accounting](../../../../general/basis%20of%20accounting.md#accrual%20basis) ::@:: Performing the work for others to earn (earning) is revenue. Having others perform the work (incurring) is expense. When the cash or cash equivalent is received or paid is irrelevant. <p> It is relevant to external decision makers. _Required_ under GAAP.
- [revenue recognition](../../../../general/revenue%20recognition.md) ::@:: It states that revenues are earned and recognized when they are realized or realizable, no matter when cash is received. <p> Note that it does not say anything about expenses. This requires the _matching principle_.
- [matching principle](../../../../general/matching%20principle.md) ::@:: It dictates that an expense should be reported in the same period as the corresponding revenue is earned. <p> Note that it works together with the revenue recognition principle to form the basis of accrual accounting.

- topic: measuring cash flows

- [capital expenditure](../../../../general/capital%20expenditure.md) (CAPEX) ::@:: Money spent in buying and improving (repairs may or may not be included, depending on the repair nature) _fixed_ assets. <p> If insufficient, it limits operation capacity. If excessive, there is excess capacity.
  - capital expenditure / characteristics ::@:: increase efficiency <br/> involve large amounts of money <br/> major overhaul or improvements <br/> may extend useful life <br/> occurs infrequently usually
  - capital expenditure / effects ::@:: Such expenditure is deferred. Current net income is higher, so is taxes. Accumulated depreciation is higher later.
- [operating expense](../../../../general/operating%20expense.md) (opex) ::@:: Also called __revenue expenditure__ (rarely). It is an ongoing cost for running a product, business, or system.
  - revenue expenditure / characteristics ::@:: does not extend useful life beyond original estimate <br/> does not increase efficiency <br/> maintains normal operating conditions <br/> recurring in nature and involves small amounts of money at each occurrence
  - revenue expenditure / effects ::@:: Such expenditure is currently recognized. Current net income is lower, so is taxes. Deprecation expense is lower later.
- depreciation
  - depreciation / effect ::@:: Say there is additional depreciation \(increase in expense\). <p> Net income would decrease, but mitigated by the tax rate, so the decrease is the additional depreciation multiplied by \(1 − tax rate\). Cash would increase, since the increase in depreciation is not cash flow, but the decrease in tax is cash flow, so the increase is the additional depreciation multiplied by tax rate. <p> This is because tax depends on pretax income.
- [cash flow](../../../../general/cash%20flow.md) ::@:: It, in general, refers to payments made into or out of a business, project, or financial product.
  - cash flow / operational cash flow ::@:: incremental earnings \(_unlevered_ net income\) + depreciation
- [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization](../../../../general/earnings%20before%20interest,%20taxes,%20depreciation%20and%20amortization.md) \(EBITDA\) ::@:: It is a measure of a company's profitability of the operating business only, thus before any effects of indebtedness, state-mandated payments, and costs required to maintain its asset base.
  - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization / motivation ::@:: Depreciation and amortization are not cash flows. Excluding them and additionally leverage \(debt\), it reflects the cash a firm has earned from operations by utilizing the assets.
  - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ::@:: EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation and amortization
- [statement of cash flows](../../../../general/cash%20flow%20statement.md)

  - statement of cash flows / effect ::@:: The change in cash should equal the difference between the beginning and ending balances of the "cash" account on the balance sheet.
  - statement of cash flows / categories ::@:: operating activities, investing activities, financing activities
  - operating activities ::@:: Cash inflows and outflows directly related to earnings from normal operations.
    - operating activities / inflows ::@:: customers <br/> interest received from trade accounts
    - operating activities / outflows ::@:: purchase of goods for resale and services (electricity, etc.) <br/> salaries and wages <br/> income taxes <br/> interest on trade liabilities
  - investing activities ::@:: Cash inflows and outflows related to the acquisition or sale of productive facilities (e.g. fixed assets) and investments in the securities of other companies.
    - investing activities / inflows ::@:: sale or disposal of property, plant and equipment <br/> sale or maturity of investments in securities <br/> investment related interest income
    - investing activities / outflows ::@:: purchase of property, plant and equipment <br/> purchase of investments in securities
  - financing activities ::@:: Cash inflows and outflows related to external sources of financing (owners and creditors) for the enterprise.
    - financing activities / inflows ::@:: borrowings on notes, mortgages, bonds, etc. from creditors <br/> issuing stock to owners
    - financing activities / outflows ::@:: repayment of principal to creditors <br/> repurchasing stock from owners <br/> dividends to owners <br/> financing related interest expense
  - operating activities
    - operating activities / methods ::@:: direct method, indirect method (almost all companies use the latter)
    - operating activities / calculation ::@:: Indirect method: Start with net income. Add depreciation and amortization, including impairment losses (no actual cash has outflowed). Then remove gains and add loss of investing assets (not operating activities, accounted for in investing activities). Then compute differences between accrual-basis accounting and cash-basis accounting and add and remove accordingly. <p> The last step (computing the differences) in details: <br/> __operating (non-cash current) assets increase/decrease__: opposite <br/> __operating (current) liabilities increase/decrease__: same
  - investing activities
    - investing activities / methods ::@:: direct method, indirect method (both are essentially the same for investing activities)
    - investing activities / calculation ::@:: purchase PPE or tangible assets for _cash_: outflow (−) <br/> sell or dispose PPE or intangible assets for _cash_: inflow (+) <br/> purchase investment securities for _cash_: outflow (−) <br/> sell (mature) investment securities for _cash_: inflow (+)
  - financing activities

- topic: fundamentals of capital budgeting
- [capital budgeting](../../../../general/capital%20budgeting.md) ::@:: It in corporate finance, corporate planning and accounting is an area of are worth the funding of cash through the firm's capitalization structures (debt, equity or retained earnings).
  - capital budgeting / steps ::@:: Estimate future expected cash flows. Estimate the required rate of return from its risk level. Apply investment decision rules, e.g. NPV, IRR, etc. Perform _sensitivity analysis_ \(__this course__: not covered\): sensitivity of NPV to forecast uncertainty.
  - capital budgeting / project ::@:: A project typically consists of 3 stages: initial outlay \(usually last for 1 year\), on-going cash flows, terminal cash flow \(usually occurs at the same time as the last on-going cash flow\).
- [free cash flow](../../../../general/free%20cash%20flow.md) \(FCF\) ::@:: It is the amount by which a business's operating cash flow exceeds its working capital needs and expenditures on fixed assets \(known as capital expenditures\). It is that portion of cash flow that can be extracted from a company and distributed to creditors and securities holders without causing issues in its operations.
  - free cash flow / steps ::@:: Estimate incremental earnings of a project \(EBIT – tax\) from a _pro forma_ \(forecasted\) income statement. Convert them into free cash flows. <p> Note that incremental earnings are not actual cash flows.
- capital expenditure
- operating expense
- free cash flow
  - free cash flow / tax ::@:: Calculated as EBIT × _marginal_ corporate tax rate. It is a cash outflow. If negative, it becomes _tax credit_ and is a cash inflow. \(In accounting, the treatment of taxes is much more complicated.\) <p> Note that since FCF is usually _unlevered_, i.e. exclude effects of debt, tax shield due to interest expense is ignored. This explains why tax is calculated using EBIT instead of \(EBIT – interest\), even though the _actual_ tax is based on the latter.
  - free cash flow / incremental earnings ::@:: Note that since FCF is usually _unlevered_, i.e. exclude effects of debt, tax shield due to interest expense is also ignored \(apart from ignoring interest expense\). Thus, the incremental earnings calculate tax using EBIT instead of \(EBIT – interest\). Hence, incremental earnings is also called _unlevered_ net income.
  - free cash flow / interest expense ::@:: Interest expense and tax shield due to interest expense is not included. <p> The motivation is FCF is cash distributable to both stockholders and _debt holders_. So a project should be judged with its operating cost, not financing cost. <p> The debt—equity mix should be considered separately.
  - free cash flow / depreciation ::@:: Depreciation is based on accounting rules, and generally does not equal economic life of the asset. So it is possible for cash inflow due to depreciation to last shorter or longer than the project life.

- topic: fundamentals of capital budgeting
- free cash flow
  - free cash flow / calculations ::@:: incremental earnings \(_unlevered_ net income\) + depreciation & amortization − capital expenditure − changes in working capital
    - free cash flow / calculations / incremental earnings ::@:: EBIT − taxes based on EBIT = EBIT × \(1 − marginal corporate tax rate\)
    - free cash flow / calculations / net income ::@:: incremental earnings \(_unlevered_ net income\) = \(_levered_\) net income + interest expense − tax shield on interest expense
  - free cash flow / depreciation
  - free cash flow / capital expenditure ::@:: Cash outflows when you have capital expenditure. But this is not immediately recognized in an income statement. So we need to add this to FCF. <p> By the cost principle, all reasonable and necessary expenditures \(e.g. _capitalized interest_, costs to get it up and running, materials, wages paid, etc.\) in constructing an asset should be _capitalized_ \(i.e. considered capital expenditure\).
  - free cash flow / changes in working capital ::@:: Increase in held cash, inventory, receivables, etc. \(current assets\) increases net income, but they do not increase cash flow. So this increase needs to be subtracted from FCF. Increase in payables, etc. \(current liabilities\) decreases net income, but they do not decrease cash flow. So this increase needs to be added to FCF. <p> Overall, increase in CA subtracted by increase in CL is changes in working capital. So changes in working capital needs to be subtracted from FCF.
    - free cash flow / changes in working capital / working capital ::@:: current assets − current liabilities = cash + inventory + accounts receivables − payables <p> Note when calculating the FCF for a project, these accounts are for the project only.
    - free cash flow / changes in working capital / pattern ::@:: Typically, there is an increase in NWC during the initial outlay of a project \(usually year 0\). At the end of a project, the NWC is typically fully recovered \(full recovery of NWC\), i.e. its balance equals its beginning balance \(usually but not necessarily zero\).
    - free cash flow / changes in working capital / cash ::@:: Notice the "cash" account is _not_ specially handled when calculating current assets. This is because the "cash" account is for incremental cash requirement, i.e. requirement to hold cash for a project. As the cash is held, it is not free cash flow.
    - free cash flow / changes in working capital / trade credit ::@:: receivables − payables <p> It can be interpreted as the net capital held up in credit transactions.
    - free cash flow / changes in working capital / recovery ::@:: Typically at the end of a project, payables are paid off, inventory are sold off, receivables are collected, so NWC equals its beginning balance, i.e. fully recovered. <p> Some NWC may not be recoverable, e.g. bad inventory, bad receivables, etc. However, accounting principles ensure these non-recoverable NWC is written off as expense, so that the total changes in NWC over a project is zero.
  - free cash flow / net present value ::@:: To evaluate a project, find the _incremental_ free cash flows. Find the NPV of these cash flows. Apply decision rules as needed. <p> Note that some decision rules above, applicable \(i.e. consistent with NPV\) in some situation, does not require you to calculate the NPV.

- topic: fundamentals of capital budgeting
- free cash flow
  - free cash flow / terminal cash flow ::@:: They happen at or after the end of a project. They include recovering net working capital, \(after-tax\) shutdown costs, after-tax liquidation value \(asset sale\), etc.
- depreciation
- net book value
  - net book value / after-tax salvage value ::@:: The difference between the actual sale value and the net book value is the gain or loss from selling the asset in accounting. This gain or loss is subject to tax. If you have gain, you have tax due. If you have loss, you have tax credit. <p> Thus, the actual cash flow is the actual sale value and the tax effect: $$\text{after-tax salvage value} = \text{sale price} - \text{gain} \times \text{corporate marginal tax rate} \,.$$ For loss, the "gain" is negative, so the above equation still applies.
- free cash flow
  - free cash flow / terminal cash flow
    - free cash flow / terminal cash flow / asset sale ::@:: Compare leaving an asset for it to be depreciated versus selling it, there are 2 effects to FCF: add the after-tax salvage value at the year of sale, and remove depreciation for years after the sale. Note that removing depreciation affects the incremental earnings, and the depreciation added to calculate FCF.
  - free cash flow / adjustments ::@:: timing of cash flows, accelerated depreciation \(MACRS\), tax carryforwards and carrybacks
    - free cash flow / adjustments / timing of cash flows ::@:: Incremental cash flows can be calculated monthly or quarterly, instead of annually.
    - free cash flow / adjustments / accelerated depreciation ::@:: Depreciation is larger earlier in the asset's life. Present value of the depreciation tax shield is thus larger. This is governed by depreciation schedules required by the relevant tax authorities \(US: IRS, HK: IRD\). <p> example: Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System \(MACRS\)
    - free cash flow / adjustments / tax carryforwards and carrybacks ::@:: Above, we assume that tax due is paid and tax credit is received on the year it occurs. This is the most simple way to handle taxes. <p> In practice, companies can take losses in a year and offset them against profits in nearby years for tax purposes. This is governed by the relevant tax laws.
  - free cash flow / incremental ::@:: Note that the FCF we have been discussing above is _incremental_. This means it is comparing changes in a firm's FCF comparing taking and not taking the project. <p> Cash flows that are _included_ include _opportunity costs_ and _project externalities_, etc. Cash flows that are _excluded_ include _sunk costs_, etc.
- [opportunity cost](../../../../general/opportunity%20cost.md) (same as that in economics) ::@:: forgone benefit of the best decision that is _not_ taken
- [externality](../../../../general/externality.md) ::@:: It is an indirect cost or benefit to an uninvolved third party that arises as an effect of another party's (or parties') activity. Externalities can be considered as unpriced components that are involved in either consumer or producer market transactions. <p> A positive externality is when an individual's consumption in a market increases the well-being of others, but the individual does not charge the third party for the benefit. A negative externality is defined analogously.
  - externality / project ::@:: project _synergy_: The project increases cash flows of other projects, e.g. a new product may increase sale of existing products. <br/> project _cannibalization_: The project decreases cash flows of other projects, e.g. a new product may decrease sale of existing products. <p> This externality should be considered part of the incremental FCF of a project. When calculating the externality, be careful to consider any other incremental changes, e.g. tax changes.
- [relevant cost](../../../../general/relevant%20cost.md) ::@:: a cost that has potential to influence decision making, which differs between decision alternatives (differential/incremental costs) and must be incurred in the future (non-sunk costs)
  - irrelevant cost ::@:: costs that are not relevant, e.g. amortization, depreciation, sunk costs
    - irrelevant cost / project ::@:: In a project, some common sunk costs are: fixed overhead expenses \(unless the expense is incremental to the project\), past R&D expenditure, unavoidable competitive effects, etc.
      - irrelevant cost / project / unavoidable competitive effects ::@:: Above, we have considered a specific example of _project cannibalization_, where a new product may decrease sale of existing products. <p> But if this loss of sales is _likely_ to happen anyway due to new products introduced by competitors, then this decrease in sale is a sunk cost, and can be ignored when calculating the incremental FCF of the project.
- [tax shield](../../../../general/tax%20shield.md) ::@:: It is the reduction in income taxes that results from taking an allowable deduction from taxable income. For example, because interest on debt is a tax-deductible expense, taking on debt creates a tax shield. <p> \(Note that FCF is usually _unlevered_, so debt tax shield is excluded.\)
  - tax shield / importance ::@:: Since a tax shield is a way to save cash flows, it increases the value of the business, and it is an important aspect of business valuation.
  - tax shield / free cash flow ::@:: When calculating incremental earnings/_unlevered_ net income, depreciation is subtracted before applying the tax rate. Then, when calculating FCF, depreciation is added back. <p> With the tax shield approach, when calculating FCF, depreciation is _not_ subtracted before applying the tax rate. After applying the tax rate, depreciation _multiplied by the tax rate_ is added back. This is mathematically equivalent to the previous paragraph. <p> Note that FCF is usually _unlevered_, so debt tax shield is excluded.
    - tax shield / free cash flow / application ::@:: The tax shield approach is very good for simplifying calculations, as long as you understand it. For example, it can be used to compute the change in FCF after buying an equipment due to depreciation.

- topic: bonds
- [bond](../../../../bond%20(finance).md) ::@:: It is a type of security under which the issuer \(debtor\) owes the holder \(creditor\) a debt, and is obliged – depending on the terms – to provide cash flow to the creditor.
  - bond / cash flows ::@:: Typical cash flows are repaying the principal \(i.e. amount borrowed\) of the bond at the maturity date and interest \(called the coupon\) over a specified amount of time.
  - bond / terminology ::@:: coupon rate, coupon payment, face value, indenture & covenant, maturity date, term
    - bond / terminology / indenture, covenant ::@:: An indenture is a formal debt agreement that establishes the terms of a bond issue, while covenants are the clauses of such an agreement.
    - bond / terminology / maturity date ::@:: final payment date
    - bond / terminology / term ::@:: duration from issuing date to maturity date
    - bond / terminology / face value, par value, principal ::@:: notational amount to compute coupon payments
    - bond / terminology / coupon rate ::@:: interest to compute coupon payments based on the face value; often expressed as APR
    - bond / terminology / coupon payment ::@:: coupon rate × face value / \# coupon payments annually
  - bond / market price ::@:: It is the present value of all future cash flows. "Dirty" includes accrued interest, while "clean" excludes it. <p> \(__this course__: We use the "clean" one for simplicity.\)
  - bond / risk ::@:: A bond may be considered either risk-free or has default risk. <p> Government bonds, e.g. United States Treasury bills, are generally considered risk-free. But note that some countries have \(repeatedly\) defaulted on their government bonds.
- [zero-coupon bond](../../../../general/zero-coupon%20bond.md) ::@:: It is a bond in which the face value is repaid at the time of maturity. Unlike regular bonds, it does not make periodic interest payments or have so-called coupons, hence the term zero-coupon bond. When the bond reaches maturity, its investor receives its par (or face) value.
  - zero-coupon bond / examples ::@:: US Treasury bills, US savings bonds, long-term zero-coupon bonds, and any type of coupon bond that has been stripped of its coupons
  - zero-coupon bond / aliases ::@:: deep discount bond, discount bond, pure discount bond
- [yield to maturity](../../../../general/yield%20to%20maturity.md) \(YTM\) ::@:: It is an estimate of the total rate of return anticipated to be earned by an investor who buys it at a given market price, holds it to maturity, and receives all interest payments and the capital redemption on schedule. <p> The YTM is often given in terms of annual percentage rate (APR), but more often market convention is followed.
  - yield to maturity / internal rate of return ::@:: It is the theoretical internal rate of return, or the overall interest rate, of a bond — the discount rate at which the present value of all future cash flows from the bond is equal to the current price of the bond.
  - yield to maturity / zero-coupon bonds ::@:: $${\text{Yield to maturity(YTM)} }={\sqrt[{\text{Time period} }]{\dfrac {\text{Face value} }{\text{Present value} } } }-1$$
- [risk-free bond](../../../../general/risk-free%20bond.md) ::@:: It is a theoretical bond that repays interest and principal with absolute certainty. The rate of return would be the risk-free interest rate.
  - risk-free bond / arbitrage ::@:: In a competitive market, risk-free investments all have the same rate of return over the same period. Otherwise, arbitrage opportunities exist.
- yield to maturity
  - yield to maturity / spot interest rate ::@:: It is the rate of return earned when a bond is bought now and sold at maturity without collecting coupon payments.
- [yield curve](../../../../general/yield%20curve.md) ::@:: It is a graph which depicts how the yields on debt instruments – such as bonds – vary as a function of their years remaining to maturity.
  - yield curve / graph ::@:: Typically, the graph's horizontal or x-axis is a time line of months or years remaining to maturity, with the shortest maturity on the left and progressively longer time periods on the right. The vertical or y-axis depicts the annualized yield to maturity.
  - yield curve / types ::@:: normal, flat, humped, inverted
    - yield curve / types / normal ::@:: It means that yields rise as maturity lengthens \(i.e., the slope of the yield curve is positive\).
    - yield curve / types / flat ::@:: It is observed when all maturities have similar yields.
    - yield curve / types / humped ::@:: It results when short-term and long-term yields are equal and medium-term yields are higher than those of the short-term and long-term.
    - yield curve / types / inverted ::@:: Under unusual circumstances, yields falls as maturity lengthens \(i.e., the slope of the yield curve is negative\).
- [coupon](../../../../general/coupon%20(finance).md) ::@:: It is the interest payment received by a bondholder from the date of issuance until the date of maturity of a bond.
  - coupon / coupon rate ::@:: Coupons are normally described in terms of the "coupon rate", which is calculated by adding the sum of coupons paid per year and dividing it by the bond's face value.
- [United States Treasury security](../../../../general/United%20States%20Treasury%20security.md) ::@:: They are government debt instruments issued by the United States Department of the Treasury to finance government spending, in addition to taxation.
  - United States Treasury security / types ::@:: \(in increasing terms\) treasury bill, treasury note, treasury bond
  - United States Treasury security / treasury bill \(T-bill\) ::@:: They are zero-coupon bonds that mature in one year or less \(4 weeks, 13 weeks, 26 weeks, etc.\). They are bought at a discount of the par value and, instead of paying a coupon interest, are eventually redeemed at that par value to create a positive yield to maturity.
  - United States Treasury security / treasury note \(T-note\) ::@:: They have maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years, have a coupon payment every six months, and are sold in increments of $100.
  - United States Treasury security / treasury bond \(T-bond\) ::@:: They have the longest maturity at twenty or thirty years. They have a coupon payment every six months like T-notes.
- bond
  - bond / market price
    - bond / market price / quote ::@:: Both market price and yield can be used to quote bonds. Higher price means lower yield, and vice versa.
    - bond / market price / issuance ::@:: The issue price at which investors buy the bonds when they are first issued will typically be approximately equal to the nominal amount. The net proceeds that the issuer receives are thus the issue price, less issuance fees.
- yield to maturity
  - yield to maturity / coupon-bearing bonds ::@:: For bonds with multiple coupons, it is not generally possible to solve for yield in terms of price algebraically. A numerical root-finding technique such as Newton's method must be used to approximate the yield, which renders the present value of future cash flows equal to the bond price. <p> \(__this course__: use a financial calculator\)
  - yield to maturity / quote ::@:: The YTM is often given in terms of annual percentage rate (APR), but more often market convention is followed. <p> \(__this course__: use APR\)
  - yield to maturity / assumptions ::@:: consistency, default risk, held to maturity, reinvestment risk
    - yield to maturity / assumptions / held to maturity ::@:: The owner holds the security to maturity.
    - yield to maturity / assumptions / reinvestment risk ::@:: The owner reinvests all interest payments \(at YTM\) rather than spending them, to gain the benefit of compounded returns.
    - yield to maturity / assumptions / default risk ::@:: The issuer makes all interest and principal payments on time and in full.
    - yield to maturity / assumptions / consistency ::@:: The market provides consistent reinvestment opportunity at the YTM rate throughout the future \(flat yield curve\), with no cost to transact.
- bond
  - bond / market price
    - bond / market price / coupon-bearing bonds ::@:: For bonds with multiple bonds, it is: $$P = \text{coupon payment} \times \frac 1 y \left(1 - \frac 1 {(1 + y)^t} \right) + \frac {\text{face value} } {(1 + y)^t} \,,$$ where $y$ is yield to maturity. The above equation assumes "clean" price. <p> If coupon payment equals face value multiplied by YTM, then market price equals face value from the above equation. This is why if coupon rate equals YTM, then a bond is selling at par.
