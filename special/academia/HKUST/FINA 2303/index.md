- topic: time value of money (TVM)
- [time value of money](../../../../general/time%20value%20of%20money.md) ::@:: It refers to the fact that there is normally a greater benefit to receiving a sum of money now rather than an identical sum later. It may be seen as an implication of the later-developed concept of time preference. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,328-->
  - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis ::@:: Consider the _present value_ cost and benefits of a decision. If cost is larger than benefit, then _reject_. If cost is smaller than benefit, then _accept_. Otherwise, you usually still _accept_ the decision. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,326-->
    - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis / example ::@:: Your company needs to make a decision. How should the managers decide whether to proceed or not? <p> Identify the _present value_ costs and benefits. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,328-->
    - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis / present value costs ::@:: e.g. additional maintenance, construction costs, increase in labor costs, land purchase <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,328-->
    - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis / present value benefits ::@:: e.g. better volume discounts, increased profit/margins, increased scales <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,328-->
    - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis / present value ::@:: The best way to compute this is converting the costs and benefit in terms of _cash today_, e.g. _current_ market prices. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,326!2025-05-20,74,328-->
- [valuation](../../../../general/valuation%20(finance).md) ::@:: the process of determining the value of a (potential) investment, asset, or security <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,328-->
  - valuation / principle ::@:: objective: to maximize value <p> steps: Identify costs and benefits. Convert costs and benefits into _today's_ cash, e.g. using _current_ market prices. Compare costs and benefits to decide if you accept the decision. The calculated number is _net present value_ (NPV). <!--SR:!2025-04-09,35,288!2025-05-21,75,326-->
    - valuation / principle / irrelevant values ::@:: They include your future expectations (e.g. the value would increase), your personal preferences (e.g. preferring A over B, even though the market price of A is lower than B). <p> Two points to note: <br/> 1. Market prices reflect the average preference of everyone for an item. Even if you value it higher or lower, you still buy/sell using the market price. So only market prices matter. <br/> 2. Your future expectations do not matter since you are making the decision _now_. For example, if you expect the price of an item will increase, and it does increase later such that iit changes your decision, you will make such a decision _in the future_. But your _current_ decision is still unaffected. <!--SR:!2025-04-13,43,308!2025-05-21,75,326-->
- [law of one price](../../../../general/law%20of%20one%20price.md) ::@:: In the absence of trade frictions (such as transport costs and tariffs), and under conditions of free _competition_ and price flexibility (where no individual sellers or buyers have power to manipulate prices and prices can freely adjust), _identical goods_ sold at _different locations_ should be sold for the _same price_ when prices are expressed in a common currency. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,326-->
  - law of one price / mechanism ::@:: This law is derived from the assumption of the inevitable _elimination of all arbitrage_. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,328-->
- [arbitrage](../../../../general/arbitrage.md) ::@:: The practice of taking advantage of a difference in prices in two or more markets – striking a combination of matching deals to capitalize on the difference, the profit being the difference between the market prices at which the unit is traded. <!--SR:!2025-05-20,74,328!2025-04-28,54,308-->
  - arbitrage / effect ::@:: Arbitrage has the effect of causing prices of the same or very similar assets in different markets to converge. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,328-->
- [interest rate](../../../../general/interest%20rate.md) ::@:: It is the amount of interest due per period, as a proportion of the amount lent, deposited, or borrowed (called the principal sum). <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,328-->
  - interest rate / time value of money ::@:: Assume you have a _risk-free_ investment that has a certain interest rate, e.g. depositing in banks. Since it is _risk-free_, the return is guaranteed. <p> So the time value of money over time increases. Compare 1 dollar _now_ vs 1 dollar _later_. The 1 dollar now can be invested in this _risk-free_ investment to earn more in the future. So 1 dollar _now_ is more worth than 1 dollar _later_. <p> By this, given a certain amount of money _now_, we can use the _risk-free_ interest rate to compute its _future_ time value. In reverse, given a certain amount of money _in the future_, we can use the _risk-free_ interest rate to compute its _present_ time value, doing the reversed operation. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,42,306!2025-04-28,54,308-->
    - interest rate / time value of money / aliases ::@:: cost of capital, discount rate, hurdle rate, interest rate, opportunity cost of capital, required rate of return <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,328-->
  - interest rate / _risk-free_ interest rate, discount rate, $r_f$ ::@:: The interest rate at which money can be borrowed or lent without risk. By depositing money, we convert money today into money in the future. By borrowing money, we exchange money in the future for money today. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,328-->
  - interest rate / interest rate factor ::@:: It is the rate of exchange _from_ dollars today _to_ dollars in the future, calculated as $(1 + r_f)^t$. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-20,74,326-->
  - interest rate / discount factor ::@:: It is the rate of exchange between dollars _from_ the future _to_ dollars today, calculated as $1 / (1 + r_f)^t$. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,328-->
- [net present value](../../../../general/net%20present%20value.md) (NPV) ::@:: net present value (NPV) = present value (benefits/cash inflows) − present value (costs/cash outflows) <!--SR:!2025-05-21,75,328!2025-05-21,75,328-->

- topic: time value of money (TVM)
- time value of money
  - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis
- finance
  - finance / valuation principles
- law of one price
- time value of money
  - time value of money / timeline ::@:: This tool can visualize cash inflows and outflows easily. It is a number line staring from time 0 on the left. Label cash inflows (positive; e.g. return), cash outflows (negative; e.g. investments), and their amounts under the number line. <!--SR:!2025-06-01,80,348!2025-06-01,80,348-->
  - time value of money / future value ::@:: Move the cash flow forward in time: $FV = PV \cdot (1 + r)^t$, where $t$ is the number of time periods forward (beware of off-by-one error). <!--SR:!2025-06-05,83,348!2025-06-01,80,348-->
    - time value of money / future value / compounding ::@:: Future value uses compound interest instead of simple interest. In the former, interest is earned on principal only. In the latter, interest is earned on principal and interest received. <p> Given a long enough time, compound interest gives much money money than simple interest. On a graph, compound interest increases exponentially while simple interest increases linearly. <!--SR:!2025-06-05,83,348!2025-04-21,45,328-->
  - time value of money / present value ::@:: Move the cash flow backward in time: $PV = \frac {FV} {(1 + r)^t}$, where $t$ is the number of time periods backwards (beware of off-by-one error). <!--SR:!2025-06-05,83,348!2025-05-26,75,348-->
  - time value of money / combining cash flow ::@:: Only cash flows at the same time can be added together. Cash flows at different time must be converted to cash flows at the same time by either compounding or discounting cash flows. <!--SR:!2025-06-04,82,348!2025-04-21,45,328-->
- [financial calculator](../../../../general/financial%20calculator.md)
  - financial calculator / common acronyms ::@:: CPT: compute (compute the missing value from the other 4 values), FV: future value, N: number of periods, I: interest rate per period (in percentage), PMT: annuity payment, PV: present value <!--SR:!2025-05-26,75,348!2025-06-04,82,348-->
  - financial calculator / hints ::@:: Remember to clear out registers between different questions. <br/> Interest rate is usually in percentage. Avoid rounding off intermediate values: use registers to store values. <br/> Negative values are cash outflows while positive values are cash inflows. <!--SR:!2025-06-05,83,348!2025-04-21,45,328-->
- time value of money
  - time value of money / finding number of periods ::@:: $N = \frac {\ln(FV / PV)} {\ln(1 + r)} = \frac {\ln FV - \ln PV} {\ln(1 + r)}$, which has units of period (usually year) <!--SR:!2025-06-06,84,348!2025-06-06,84,348-->
  - time value of money / finding interest rate ::@:: $r = (FV / PV)^{1 / N} - 1$ <!--SR:!2025-06-04,82,348!2025-06-06,84,348-->
- [rule of 72](../../../../general/rule%20of%2072.md) (or 70 or 69.3) ::@:: How long does it take to double your investment? This rule gives a rough approximation. <p> The rule states, to double your investment, the interest rate per period in _percentage_ multiplied by the number of periods should be approximately 72. <!--SR:!2025-04-21,45,328!2025-04-23,47,328-->

- time value of money
  - time value of money / timeline
  - time value of money / combining cash flow
  - time value of money / multiple cash flows ::@:: annuity (annuity due, ordinary annuity), perpetuity; growing annuity, growing perpetuity <!--SR:!2025-05-29,75,351!2025-05-08,57,331-->
- [perpetuity](../../../../general/perpetuity.md) ::@:: It is an annuity that has no end, or a stream of cash payments that continues forever. <!--SR:!2025-05-30,76,351!2025-05-29,75,351-->
  - perpetuity / intuition ::@:: You want to earn $C$ at the end of each year forever (excluding year 0). <p> Assuming the interest rate $r$ is fixed. Then you need to invest $P = C / r$ at year 0. This $P$ is also how one calculates the present value of a perpetuity. <!--SR:!2025-05-29,75,351!2025-05-30,76,351-->
  - perpetuity / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = C / r$$ <p> This equation assumes the first payment is at first year end. Multiply by $1 + r$ if the first payment is at first year start, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period. <!--SR:!2025-05-30,76,351!2025-05-29,75,351-->
  - perpetuity / present value ::@:: Notice that the present value is always the same when evaluated at any time. <!--SR:!2025-05-29,75,351!2025-05-05,51,331-->
- [annuity](../../../../general/annuity.md) ::@:: It is a series of payments made at equal intervals. <!--SR:!2025-05-29,75,351!2025-05-07,56,331-->
  - annuity / types ::@:: ordinary annuity: payment is made at period end, annuity due: payment is made at period start <!--SR:!2025-05-30,76,351!2025-05-29,75,351-->
  - annuity / relation to perpetuity ::@:: You can interpret as an annuity as a perpetuity that you transfer away to others for free at annuity end (after getting the cash flow for annuity end). <p> This gives the equation for an annuity directly by subtracting the PV of the perpetuity at annuity end from the PV of perpetuity at annuity start. <!--SR:!2025-05-30,76,351!2025-05-30,76,351-->
  - annuity / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = \frac C r \left(1 - \frac 1 {(1 + r)^t} \right) \,,$$ where $t$ is the number of periods. <p> This equation assumes the annuity is an ordinary annuity. For annuity due, multiply by $1 + r$, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period. <!--SR:!2025-05-29,75,351!2025-05-30,76,351-->
  - annuity / equation for FV ::@:: Just multiply the PV formula by $(1 + r)^t$, where $t$ is the number of periods in the future. This is because the annuity has the same value as a lump-sum of PV amount. <p> This changes the above equation to: $$FV = \frac C r \left((1 + r)^t - 1 \right) \,,$$ if $FV$ is evaluated at the annuity end. <!--SR:!2025-05-29,75,351!2025-05-30,76,351-->
  - annuity / note ::@:: If a question does not explicitly mention if an annuity is ordinary or due, assume ordinary. <!--SR:!2025-06-25,89,373!2025-06-29,92,373-->

- topic: time value of money: valuing cash flow streams
- perpetuity
  - perpetuity / equation for PV
- annuity
  - annuity / equation for PV
  - annuity / equation for FV
- perpetuity
  - perpetuity / growing ::@:: The payment grows exponentially instead of staying constant. It continues forever. <p> More precisely, the first payment starts at $C$, and then each year after it grows by $g$ (multiplied by $1 + g$). <!--SR:!2025-06-19,87,363!2025-06-09,79,363-->
    - perpetuity / growing / intuition ::@:: Recall the intuition for non-growing perpetuity. <p> Then for growing perpetuity, your earnings grows by $g$ (multiplied by $1 + g$) each year after the first year. That means the principal in the fund will need to grow by $g$ as well. That means the interested you have earned on the principal needs to be separated into two parts: one to grow the principal by $g$, the other to provide the payment. The payment you actually obtain is $r - g$ of the principal then. <p> You want to earn $C$ at the end of each year forever (excluding year 0). Assuming the interest rate $r$ is fixed. Then you need to invest $P = C / (r - g)$ at year 0. This $P$ is also how one calculates the present value of a growing perpetuity. <!--SR:!2025-05-04,46,321!2025-06-07,77,361-->
    - perpetuity / growing / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = \frac C {r - g}$$ <p> This equation assumes the first payment is at first year end. Multiply by $1 + r$ if the first payment is at first year start, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period. <!--SR:!2025-06-08,78,363!2025-05-23,65,343-->
    - perpetuity / growing / present value ::@:: Notice that the present value is _not_ always the same when evaluated at any time. Rather, it grows by $g$ (multiplied by $1 + g$) each year. <!--SR:!2025-06-18,86,363!2025-06-22,90,361-->
- annuity
  - annuity / growing ::@:: The payment grows exponentially instead of staying constant. It ends after some time. <p> More precisely, the first payment starts at $C$, and then each year after it grows by $g$ (multiplied by $1 + g$), until the annuity ends. <!--SR:!2025-06-25,93,363!2025-06-19,87,363-->
    - annuity / growing / relation to perpetuity ::@:: The relation is exactly the same, but with growing payments instead of constant payments. <!--SR:!2025-06-20,88,363!2025-06-21,89,361-->
    - annuity / growing / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = \frac C {r - g} \left(1 - \frac {(1 + g)^t} {(1 + r)^t} \right) \,,$$ where $t$ is the number of periods. <p> This equation assumes the annuity is an ordinary annuity. For annuity due, multiply by $1 + r$, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period. <!--SR:!2025-05-03,45,321!2025-06-23,91,361-->
    - annuity / growing / equation for FV ::@:: Just multiply the PV formula by $(1 + r)^t$, where $t$ is the number of periods in the future. This is because the growing annuity has the same value as a lump-sum of PV amount. <p> This changes the above equation to: $$FV = \frac C {r - g} \left((1 + r)^t - (1 + g)^t \right) \,,$$ if $FV$ is evaluated at the annuity end. <!--SR:!2025-05-03,45,323!2025-05-02,44,323-->
- time value of money
  - time value of money / rearranging formulas ::@:: Note that the formulas can be used flexibly. That is, it can be used for more than finding the variable at LHS. In fact, if you have all variables except for one, you can rearrange the equations to find the missing variable. <p> However, there are exceptions not having closed-form algebraic expressions... Interest rate is one of them. <!--SR:!2025-06-24,92,361!2025-06-11,81,361-->
- annuity
  - annuity / finding cash flow ::@:: Rearrange the formulas appropriately to find the cash flow/payment. Actually it is too simple that I will not list the equation here... <!--SR:!2025-06-11,81,361!2025-06-19,87,363-->
  - annuity / finding interest rate ::@:: As mentioned above, there is no closed-form algebraic expression for finding the interest rate from other variables. <p> You can either use a financial calculator, or do trial-and-error (which is what calculators are doing behind the scenes...). <!--SR:!2025-06-25,93,363!2025-05-20,59,341-->
    - annuity / finding interest rate / financial calculator ::@:: Simple, just fill in the other variables _properly_ and leave out the interest rate... <!--SR:!2025-06-09,79,363!2025-06-07,77,363-->
    - annuity / finding interest rate / trial-and-error ::@:: Using intuition, guess an interest rate. Calculate the value for another variable assuming that interest rate. Observe the error between the actual value of that other variable. Using intuition, guess if the interest rate needs to be higher or lower, and by how much. Repeat until you get a good enough answer. <p> (The instructor told us that we will not need to calculate the exact value... But we still need to know how to guess.) <!--SR:!2025-06-10,80,361!2025-05-23,65,343-->
  - annuity / finding number of periods ::@:: Given present value (money you have now) $PV$, future value (money to save) $PV$, interest rate $r$, and _ordinary_ annuity payment $C$, we can derive the equation for number of periods $t$: $$\begin{aligned} FV & = PV (1 + r)^t + \frac C r \left((1 + r)^t - 1 \right) \\ (1 + r)^t & = \frac {FV + \frac C r} {PV + \frac C r} = \frac {r \cdot FV + C} {r \cdot PV + C} \\ t & = \frac {\ln(r \cdot FV + C) - \ln(r \cdot PV + C)} {\ln(1 + r)} \,. \end{aligned}$$ So the equation is the last expression, for those without a financial calculator. <!--SR:!2025-05-04,46,321!2025-04-13,29,303-->
    - annuity / finding number of periods / intuition ::@:: Observe the equation: $$t = \frac {\ln(r \cdot FV + C) - \ln(r \cdot PV + C)} {\ln(1 + r)} \,.$$ You can see $r \cdot FV + C$ would have been the next payment after the annuity ends if the annuity had not ended. $r \cdot PV + C$ is the first payment. This is interesting... it seems like it somehow relates to the growth... <!--SR:!2025-05-21,60,341!2025-06-24,92,363-->

- datetime: 2025-02-21T16:30:00+08:00/2025-02-21T17:50:00+08:00
- topic: interest rates
- interest rate
  - interest rate / quoted in ::@:: annual percentage rate (APR), effective annual rate (EAR); both are _nominal_ <!--SR:!2025-06-10,80,361!2025-05-23,65,343-->
- [annual percentage rate](../../../../general/annual%20percentage%20rate.md) (APR) ::@:: the _simple-interest_ rate for a _whole year_ (annualized), rather than just a monthly fee/rate <!--SR:!2025-06-09,79,361!2025-05-20,59,341-->
  - annual percentage rate / prevalence ::@:: It is almost always the rate quoted in industry. <p> _Important_: Unless otherwise specified, interest rates given in questions are always this. <!--SR:!2025-06-25,93,363!2025-06-23,91,363-->
  - annual percentage rate / conversion between durations ::@:: If the time duration is multiplied by $k$, multiply the interest rate by $k$ as well: $$r_{\text{new} } = k r_{\text{old} } \,.$$ <p> Note: APR requires the duration to be a year. If not, it would be just annual \(something\) rate. <!--SR:!2025-06-08,78,363!2025-06-13,83,363-->
  - annual percentage rate / to effective annual rate ::@:: $$\text{EAR} = (1 + \text{APR} / m)^m - 1 \,,$$ where $m$ is the number of compounding in a year. <!--SR:!2025-05-02,44,323!2025-06-12,82,363-->
- [effective annual rate](../../../../general/effective%20interest%20rate.md) (EAR) ::@:: the percentage of interest on a loan or financial product for a _whole year_ if _compound interest_ accumulates in periods different than a year <!--SR:!2025-06-19,87,361!2025-05-27,64,341-->
  - effective annual rate / motivation ::@:: Always use this rather than the other one when comparing interest rates (e.g. annual IRR) for decision-making! It can also be used to value non-annual cash flows. <!--SR:!2025-06-18,86,361!2025-06-10,80,363-->
  - effective annual rate / conversion between durations ::@:: If the time duration is multiplied by $k$ is multiplied by $k$, you need to do an exponentiation: $$r_{\text{new} } = (1 + r_{\text{old} })^k - 1 \,.$$ Importantly, do _not_ simply just multiply by $k$! <p> Note: EAR requires the duration to be a year. If not, it would be just effective interest rate (EIR). <!--SR:!2025-06-13,83,363!2025-06-12,82,361-->
  - effective annual rate / vs. annual percentage rate ::@:: We see that EAR equals APR if the interest rate is compounded annually. Otherwise, EAR > APR if the interest rate is compounded more frequently than annually, and EAR < APR if the interest rate is compounded less frequently than annually. <!--SR:!2025-06-20,88,363!2025-06-18,86,361-->
  - effective annual rate / to annual percentage rate ::@:: $$\text{APR} = m \left((1 + \text{EAR})^{1 / m} - 1\right) \,,$$ where $m$ is the number of compounding in a year. <!--SR:!2025-06-13,83,361!2025-05-01,43,321-->

- topic: interest rates
- annual percentage rate
- effective annual rate
- [amortizing loan](../../../../general/amortizing%20loan.md) ::@:: a loan where the principal of the loan is paid down over the life of the loan (that is, amortized) according to an amortization schedule, typically through equal payments. <!--SR:!2025-05-30,67,353!2025-06-20,85,373-->
  - amortizing loan / equated monthly installment (EMI) ::@:: Payments are divided into equal amounts for the duration of the loan, making it the simplest repayment model. A greater amount of the payment is applied to _interest_ at the beginning of the amortization schedule, while more money is applied to _principal_ at the end. <!--SR:!2025-06-17,82,373!2025-07-02,95,373-->
  - amortizing loan / terminology ::@:: balance/principal outstanding, interest, principal <!--SR:!2025-05-18,57,353!2025-06-20,85,373-->
  - amortizing loan / amortizing schedule ::@:: It can be an Excel spreadsheet showing balance/principal outstanding, interest paid, and principal paid. <!--SR:!2025-06-19,84,373!2025-06-20,85,373-->
  - amortizing loan / intuition ::@:: Literally just ordinary annuity, but the direction of payment is reversed. <!--SR:!2025-06-23,87,373!2025-06-25,89,373-->
  - amortizing loan / equated monthly installment
    - amortizing loan / equated monthly installment / formula ::@:: This is captured by the formula $$P\,=\,A\cdot {\frac {1-\left({\frac {1}{1+r} }\right)^{n} }{r} }$$ or, equivalently, $$A\,=\,P\cdot {\frac {r(1+r)^{n} }{(1+r)^{n}-1} }$$ where: _P_ is the principal amount borrowed, _A_ is the periodic amortization payment, _r_ is the periodic interest rate divided by 100 \(nominal annual interest rate also divided by 12 in case of monthly installments\), and _n_ is the total number of payments \(for a 30-year loan with monthly payments _n_ = 30 × 12 = 360\). <!--SR:!2025-05-29,63,353!2025-04-18,30,313-->
  - amortizing loan / outstanding balance ::@:: You want to find the outstanding loan balance at time _t_. <p> First, assuming EMI, find the installment using the above formulas. Then, you can either consider the _remaining balance_, which is the PV evaluated at time _t_ of the remaining payments, or consider the _outstanding loan_, which is the FV evaluated at time _t_ of the original loan minus the FV evaluated at time _t_ of the paid payments. <p> (The former one seems easier...) <!--SR:!2025-05-17,57,353!2025-06-29,92,373-->
    - amortizing loan / outstanding balance / formula ::@:: Assuming EMI. The outstanding principal at time _t_ is: $$P_t = P_0 \frac {1 - \frac 1 {(1 + r)^{T - t} } } {1 - \frac 1 {(1 + r)^T } } \,,$$ where _P_<sub>0</sub> is the \(original\) principal, _r_ is the interest rate, and _T_ is the total number of payments (paid _and_ remaining). <!--SR:!2025-04-18,30,313!2025-06-26,90,373-->
- [opportunity cost of capital](../../../../general/cost%20of%20capital.md) ::@:: It is the cost of a company's funds (both debt and equity), or from an investor's point of view is "the required rate of return on a portfolio company's existing securities". <p> It is the best available expected return offered in the market on an investment of _comparable risk and term_ to the cash flows being discounted. <!--SR:!2025-04-29,38,333!2025-06-03,67,353-->
  - opportunity cost of capital / risk-free return ::@:: Many investors consider US Treasury bonds as "risk-free". Thus for any borrowing that is not considered "risk-free", investors require a higher rate of return. <!--SR:!2025-06-19,84,373!2025-06-29,92,373-->

- topic: investment decision rules
- investment decision rules ::@:: Rules for making investments, _usually_ to maximize value. <!--SR:!2025-05-29,63,353!2025-06-26,90,373-->
  - investment decision rules / project types ::@:: standalone projects, mutually exclusive projects, mix of the above <!--SR:!2025-06-24,88,373!2025-06-19,84,373-->
- standalone project ::@:: discounted payback period, internal rate of return, net present value, payback period, etc. <!--SR:!2025-06-25,89,373!2025-06-18,83,373-->
- mutually exclusive project ::@:: duration \(lives\) difference, scale difference, timing difference, etc. <!--SR:!2025-07-02,95,373!2025-06-20,85,373-->
- net present value
  - net present value / interpretation ::@:: Zero NPV (cf. _normal profit_ in economics) allows us to recover invested capital (i.e. no loss) and receive return on capital (i.e. return comparable with the market interest rate). Positive NPV (cf. _abnormal profit_ in economics) _additionally_ allows us to create _value_ for investors (i.e. extra return above the market interest rate). <!--SR:!2025-06-17,82,373!2025-05-29,63,353-->
    - net present value / interpretation / zero NPV ::@:: From an economics standpoint, in a _perfectly_ competitive/efficient market, there should not be any abnormal profit, i.e. no investments with positive NPV. Investments are either zero or negative NPV. So you _should accept_ zero NPV projects unless you have good \(non-financial\) reasons to not to. <p> \(Of course, the real world is not _perfectly_ competitive/efficient...\) <!--SR:!2025-06-20,85,373!2025-06-27,90,373-->
  - net present value / decision rule ::@:: For standalone projects \(i.e. either take or leave\), _accept_ positive NPV projects. _Reject_ negative NPV projects. _Accept_ zero NPV projects unless you have good \(non-financial\) reasons to not to, for the reasons described above. <p> To choose among mutually exclusive projects, choose the alternative with the _highest non-negative_ NPV. If all projects have negative NPV, then _reject all_. <!--SR:!2025-07-01,94,373!2025-06-18,83,373-->
  - net present value / NPV profile ::@:: It is a _xy_-plot that, given a cost of capital, shows the NPV of an investment or loan/delayed investment. The point where the graph crosses _y_ = 0 (zero NPV) has an _x_ value that is the _internal rate of return_ (IRR). <p> For an investment, the graph is decreasing. For a loan/delayed investment, the graph is increasing. <p> Note that for unconventional cash flows, all of the above (include increasing/decreasing graphs) may not be true. In fact, it is possible to have multiple points where the graph crosses _y_ = 0, yielding _multiple IRRs_. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,90,373!2025-06-23,87,373-->
- investment decision rules
  - investment decision rules / investment vs. loan/delayed investment ::@:: The former refers to cash outflows are before cash inflows. The latter refers to all cash inflows are before cash outflows. <!--SR:!2025-05-12,38,353!2025-06-25,89,373-->
- [internal rate of return](../../../../general/internal%20rate%20of%20return.md) \(IRR\) ::@:: It is a method of calculating an investment's rate of return. The term _internal_ refers to the fact that the calculation excludes external factors, such as the risk-free rate, inflation, the cost of capital, or financial risk. <!--SR:!2025-05-29,63,353!2025-06-20,85,373-->
  - internal rate of return / application timing ::@:: The method may be applied either ex-post (after) or ex-ante (before). Applied ex-ante, the IRR is an estimate of a future annual rate of return. Applied ex-post, it measures the actual achieved investment return of a historical investment. <!--SR:!2025-06-21,85,373!2025-06-28,91,373-->
  - internal rate of return / definition ::@:: It of an investment or project is the "annualized effective compounded return rate" or rate of return that sets the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows (both positive and negative) from the investment equal to zero. <!--SR:!2025-06-19,84,373!2025-05-18,57,353-->
  - internal rate of return / calculation ::@:: Similar to calculating interest rate, there is no closed formula for it. Either use a financial calculator or use trial-and-error. <!--SR:!2025-06-26,90,373!2025-06-23,87,373-->
  - internal rate of return / interpretation ::@:: It measures the _average return_ of an investment, or the _average interest rate_ of a loan/delayed investment, independent of the actual interest rate/cost of capital. <p> It also measures the _sensitivity_ of the NPV to measurement errors in the cost of capital. The difference between the cost of capital and the IRR is the error margin: By how much your cost of capital can wrong without changing your decision? \(It applies for both investment and loan/delayed investment.\) <!--SR:!2025-06-24,88,373!2025-06-20,85,373-->
  - internal rate of return / intuition ::@:: It is the discount rate needed to make all cash flows now and in the future to have a net present value of zero. Notice that it does not distinguish between inflow and outflow: Both are discounted by equal amount given that they have the same timing. This means if more inflows are in the farther future, inflows are discounted more. Same goes for outflows. <p> This explains the difference in the decision rules for investment and loan/delayed investment. In the former, the cash flows being discounted are the inflows. Higher IRR means the inflows are worth more to begin with before being discounted. So higher is better. In the latter the cash flows being discounted are the outflows. Higher IRR means the outflows are worth more to being with before being discounted. So lower is better. <!--SR:!2025-05-29,63,353!2025-06-26,90,373-->
  - internal rate of return / weakness ::@:: It generally cannot be used for non-conventional cash flows (neither an investment nor a loan/delayed investment). <p> For mutually exclusive projects, IRR is _scale-independent_ and _timing-dependent_, so it is not suitable. <p> Since all cash flows are assumed to be discounted at the internal rate of return, this means we are assuming an environment where all cash inflows can be \(re-\)invested at the internal rate of return rather than the cost of capital. For an investment with high IRR, this may over-estimate the return. <!--SR:!2025-05-29,63,353!2025-06-19,84,373-->
  - internal rate of return / decision rule ::@:: For a standalone investment, _accept_ those with an IRR of _at least_ the cost of capital. _Reject_ others. For a standalone loan/delayed investment, _accept_ those with an IRR _not higher than_ the cost of capital. _Reject_ others. These rules are _consistent_ (i.e. make the same decision) as that for NPV, given that projects are of _similar_ _duration_/_life_, _scale_, and _timing_. <p> For non-conventional cash flows (neither an investment nor a loan/delayed investment) or mutually exclusive projects, IRR is generally unsuitable, and we should use NPV or other rules instead. <p> (Note: In the book and the course, the IRR rule is considered reliable _only_ for investment, and this excludes loan/delayed investment.) <!--SR:!2025-06-07,70,353!2025-06-22,86,373-->
  - internal rate of return / note ::@:: In this course, use the NPV rule instead of IRR rule, even for loan/delayed investment. <!--SR:!2025-05-29,63,353!2025-06-24,88,373-->
- [payback period](../../../../general/payback%20period.md) ::@:: It is the time required to recoup the funds expended in an investment, or to reach the break-even point. <p> It _does not discount_ the cash flows. <!--SR:!2025-06-28,91,373!2025-06-18,83,373-->
  - payback period / decision rule ::@:: First, define a pre-specified length of time is the _maximum payback period_. <p> For a standalone project, if the payload period is _not greater than_ the maximum, _accept_ the project. Otherwise _reject_. <p> This rule is generally _not consistent_ with NPV. <!--SR:!2025-06-18,83,373!2025-06-19,84,373-->
  - payback period / calculation ::@:: Calculate the time required to payback the initial investment. No discounting is done. <p> Alternative, find out how much is received within the maximum payback period and see if it can payback the initial investment. No discounting is done. <p> (In the book and homework, the payback period is calculated assuming cash flows are continuous, i.e. direct division is enough and rounding up is unnecessary.) <!--SR:!2025-06-22,86,373!2025-06-26,90,373-->

    - payback period / decision rule / disadvantages ::@:: The maximum payback period/payback period cutoff is arbitrary. Cash flows after the cutoff is ignored. Not necessarily consistent with maximizing shareholder value (since it is not generally consistent with NPV). <!--SR:!2025-07-01,94,373!2025-05-18,57,353-->

    - internal rate of return / decision rule / disadvantages ::@:: Hard to compute (no closed formula). Cannot be used to choose among mutually exclusive projects \(at least not by directly comparing IRRs\). Can be misleading for loan/delayed investment and projects with unconventional cash flows. There may be _multiple IRRs_ (roots in the NPV profile) for unconventional cash flows. <!--SR:!2025-06-18,83,373!2025-06-22,86,373-->
- [discounted payback period](../../../../general/discounted%20payback%20period.md) ::@:: \(untaught\) It is the amount of time that it takes (in years) for the initial cost of a project to equal to the _discounted_ value of expected cash flows, or the time it takes to break even from an investment. It is the period in which the cumulative net present value of a project equals zero. <p> It _does discount_ the cash flows. <!--SR:!2025-06-17,82,373!2025-06-30,93,373-->

When you scale up a project while keeping everything else the same, NPV scales up proportionally while IRR remains the same. As NPV is consistent with maximizing wealth (as a direct application of the valuation principle), we should use NPV for projects of different scales. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,23,368!2025-04-12,25,368-->

- topic: investment decision rules
- mutually exclusive project
  - mutually exclusive project / scale difference
    - mutually exclusive project / scale difference / using IRR ::@:: What if you want to use IRR for projects of different scales anyway? Use incremental cash flows (larger project cash flows minus smaller project cash flows, including the starting cash flow) instead and compute its internal rate of return. \(The steps and _precautions_ are mentioned below.\) <!--SR:!2025-04-12,25,368!2025-04-12,25,368-->
    - mutually exclusive project / scale difference / NPV profile ::@:: If the projects/investments are of the same scale \(and same timing and same duration\), the NPV graph of the project with a higher IRR is always higher than that with a lower IRR and never intersects. However, if they are of different scales, then the two graphs can intersect each other. This intersection point is known as the _crossover point_, its _x_ value is the cost of capital for which the NPVs of the two projects are equal, and its _y_ value is the corresponding NPV. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,23,368!2025-04-11,24,368-->
- internal rate of return
  - internal rate of return / incremental ::@:: Compute incremental cash flows \(_larger_ project cash flows minus _smaller_ project cash flows, including the starting cash flow\). Check if the cash flows is a normal investment, as opposed to a loan/delayed investment or unconventional cash flows. (If not, see below.) <p> Compute its internal rate of return. This is known as the _crossover point_. If it is higher than or equal to the cost of capital, accept the _larger_ project. Otherwise reject. <!--SR:!2025-06-17,82,373!2025-05-26,63,353-->
    - internal rate of return / incremental / intuition ::@:: Intuitively, the incremental cash flows give the difference if we choose the larger project and giving up the smaller project. Now our decision becomes between accepting the difference and rejecting it. This decision can be considered a standalone project (and it is a normal investment since increment cash outflows are before incremental cash inflows). This difference is worth it if its NPV is nonnegative. So we can use IRR again. <!--SR:!2025-04-30,39,333!2025-06-07,70,353-->
    - internal rate of return / increment / caution ::@:: If you find the cash flow is a loan/delayed investment, you have probably done _smaller_ project cash flow minus _larger_ cash flow. The IRR calculated will be the same, but your decision rule is reversed, i.e. reject the _smaller_ project (accept the _larger_ project) if IRR is higher than or equal to the cost of capital. Otherwise reject <p> If you find the cash flow is unconventional, you should not use the IRR decision rule. Use another one as appropriate, e.g. equivalent annual annuity (EAA/EAC), net present value (NPV), etc. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,90,373!2025-06-28,91,373-->
- mutually exclusive project
  - mutually exclusive project / timing difference ::@:: Timing of cash flows affects both NPV and IRR, and in different ways. IRR is more sensitive to timing. It is possible to alter the ranking of projects based on IRR without altering that based on NPV. <p> Thus using IRR is _not_ consistent with using NPV with different timing. In this case, we should always rely on NPV, since it is a direct application of the valuation principle. <p> On a NPV profile, with different timing, it is possible for _crossover points_ to appear even if the two projects have the same scale. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,23,368!2025-04-10,23,368-->
- internal rate of return
  - internal rate of return / decision rule
    - internal rate of return / decision rule / advantages
    - internal rate of return / decision rule / disadvantages
- mutually exclusive project
  - mutually exclusive project / duration difference \(different lives\) ::@:: If two investments last for different durations \(e.g. a service\), computing NPV ignores their useful durations. But this is easily fixed by doing an extra thing: calculating the _equivalent annual annuity_ \(EAA\) that last for the duration of the respective investment. \(Directly dividing the NPV by the duration ignores the _time value of money_.\) <!--SR:!2025-04-10,23,368!2025-04-10,23,368-->
- [equivalent annual cost](../../../../general/equivalent%20annual%20cost.md) \(EAC\) ::@:: It is the cost per year of owning and operating an asset over its entire lifespan. <!--SR:!2025-04-12,25,368!2025-04-11,24,368-->
  - equivalent annual cost / calculation ::@:: It is calculated by dividing the negative [NPV](../../../../general/net%20present%20value.md) of a project by the "present value of [annuity](../../../../general/annuity%20(finance%20theory).md) factor": $$\mathrm {EAC} =-{\frac {\mathrm {NPV} }{A_{t,r} } } \,,$$ where $${A_{t,r} }={\frac {1-{\frac {1}{(1+r)^{t} } } }{r} }$$ where _r_ is the annual interest rate and _t_ is the number of years. <p> Alternatively, EAC can be obtained by multiplying the NPV of the project by the "loan repayment factor". <!--SR:!2025-04-10,23,368!2025-04-12,25,368-->
  - equivalent annual cost / equivalent annual annuity \(EAA\) ::@:: This different naming \(used by the course and the book\) is to reflect that this can be used for more than costs. <p> Note that in this case, the resulting sign is inverted, since we are considering an "annuity" instead of "cost" now. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,23,368!2025-04-11,24,368-->
  - equivalent annual cost / additional considerations ::@:: Consider all available options and possible scenarios beyond replacement cost and required life, e.g. flexibility, risk, etc. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,23,368!2025-06-01,58,348-->

It reflects the premium that the buyer pays in addition to the net value of its other assets. It is often understood to represent the firm's intrinsic ability to acquire and retain customer business, where that ability is not otherwise attributable to brand name recognition, contractual arrangements or other specific factors. It is classified as an intangible asset on the balance sheet, since it can neither be seen nor touched. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,23,368!2025-04-11,24,368-->

  - earnings per share / diluted ::@:: It is a company's earnings per share calculated using fully diluted shares outstanding (i.e. including the impact of stock option grants and convertible bonds). Diluted EPS indicates a "worst case" scenario, one that reflects the issuance of stock for all outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities that would reduce earnings per share. <!--SR:!2025-04-12,25,368!2025-04-12,25,368-->
- [retained earnings](../../../../general/retained%20earnings.md) ::@:: It of a corporation is the accumulated net income of the corporation that is retained by the corporation at a particular point in time, such as at the end of the reporting period. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,23,368!2025-04-12,25,368-->

When the cash or cash equivalent is received or paid is irrelevant. <p> It is relevant to external decision makers. _Required_ under GAAP. <!--SR:!2025-04-11,24,368!2025-04-12,25,368-->
- [revenue recognition](../../../../general/revenue%20recognition.md) ::@:: It states that revenues are earned and recognized when they are realized or realizable, no matter when cash is received. <p> Note that it does not say anything about expenses. This requires the _matching principle_. <!--SR:!2025-04-10,23,368!2025-04-11,24,368-->
- [matching principle](../../../../general/matching%20principle.md) ::@:: It dictates that an expense should be reported in the same period as the corresponding revenue is earned. <p> Note that it works together with the revenue recognition principle to form the basis of accrual accounting. <!--SR:!2025-04-12,25,368!2025-04-12,25,368-->

- topic: measuring cash flows
- [capital expenditure](../../../../general/capital%20expenditure.md) (CAPEX) ::@:: Money spent in buying and improving (repairs may or may not be included, depending on the repair nature) _fixed_ assets. <p> If insufficient, it limits operation capacity. If excessive, there is excess capacity. <!--SR:!2025-04-25,26,383!2025-04-23,24,383-->
  - capital expenditure / characteristics ::@:: increase efficiency <br/> involve large amounts of money <br/> major overhaul or improvements <br/> may extend useful life <br/> occurs infrequently usually <!--SR:!2025-04-17,18,363!2025-04-23,24,383-->
  - capital expenditure / effects ::@:: Such expenditure is deferred. Current net income is higher, so is taxes. Accumulated depreciation is higher later. <!--SR:!2025-04-23,24,383!2025-04-17,18,363-->
- [operating expense](../../../../general/operating%20expense.md) (opex) ::@:: Also called __revenue expenditure__ (rarely). It is an ongoing cost for running a product, business, or system. <!--SR:!2025-04-25,26,383!2025-04-24,25,383-->
  - revenue expenditure / characteristics ::@:: does not extend useful life beyond original estimate <br/> does not increase efficiency <br/> maintains normal operating conditions <br/> recurring in nature and involves small amounts of money at each occurrence <!--SR:!2025-05-28,50,363!2025-04-25,26,383-->
  - revenue expenditure / effects ::@:: Such expenditure is currently recognized. Current net income is lower, so is taxes. Accumulated deprecation is lower later. <!--SR:!2025-04-25,26,383!2025-04-18,19,363-->
- depreciation
  - depreciation / effect ::@:: Say there is additional depreciation \(increase in expense\). <p> Net income would decrease, but mitigated by the tax rate, so the decrease is the additional depreciation multiplied by \(1 − tax rate\). Cash would increase, since the increase in depreciation is not cash flow, but the decrease in tax is cash flow, so the increase is the additional depreciation multiplied by tax rate. <p> This is because tax depends on pretax income. <!--SR:!2025-04-23,24,383!2025-04-24,25,383-->
- [cash flow](../../../../general/cash%20flow.md) ::@:: It, in general, refers to payments made into or out of a business, project, or financial product. <!--SR:!2025-04-24,25,383!2025-04-18,19,363-->
  - cash flow / operational cash flow ::@:: incremental earnings + depreciation <!--SR:!2025-04-23,24,383!2025-04-18,19,363-->
- [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization](../../../../general/earnings%20before%20interest,%20taxes,%20depreciation%20and%20amortization.md) \(EBITDA\) ::@:: It is a measure of a company's profitability of the operating business only, thus before any effects of indebtedness, state-mandated payments, and costs required to maintain its asset base. <!--SR:!2025-04-24,25,383!2025-04-25,26,383-->
  - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization / motivation ::@:: Depreciation and amortization are not cash flows. Excluding them and additionally leverage \(debt\), it reflects the cash a firm has earned from operations by utilizing the assets. <!--SR:!2025-04-25,26,383!2025-04-25,26,383-->
  - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ::@:: EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation and amortization <!--SR:!2025-04-24,25,383!2025-04-25,26,383-->

  - [ACCT 2010/statement of cash flows](../ACCT%202010/statement%20of%20cash%20flows.md)
  - [cash equivalent](../../../../general/cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents.md) ::@:: examples: <br/> short-term, highly liquid investments <br/> readily convertible into cash <br/> maturities of less than 3 months: time span short enough market value is not affected by interest rate changes <!--SR:!2025-04-25,26,383!2025-04-18,19,363-->
  - statement of cash flows / effect ::@:: The change in cash should equal the difference between the beginning and ending balances of the "cash" account on the balance sheet. <!--SR:!2025-04-24,25,383!2025-04-25,26,383-->
  - statement of cash flows / categories ::@:: operating activities, investing activities, financing activities <!--SR:!2025-04-18,19,363!2025-04-25,26,383-->

Then remove gains and add loss of investing assets (not operating activities, accounted for in investing activities). Then compute differences between accrual-basis accounting and cash-basis accounting and add and remove accordingly. <p> The last step (computing the differences) in details: <br/> __operating (non-cash current) assets increase/decrease__: opposite <br/> __operating (current) liabilities increase/decrease__: same <!--SR:!2025-04-11,14,363!2025-04-16,17,363-->

- topic: fundamentals of capital budgeting
- [capital budgeting](../../../../general/capital%20budgeting.md) ::@:: It in corporate finance, corporate planning and accounting is an area of are worth the funding of cash through the firm's capitalization structures (debt, equity or retained earnings). <!--SR:!2025-04-24,25,383!2025-04-25,26,383-->
  - capital budgeting / steps ::@:: Estimate future expected cash flows. Estimate the required rate of return from its risk level. Apply investment decision rules, e.g. NPV, IRR, etc. Perform _sensitivity analysis_ \(this course: not covered\): sensitivity of NPV to forecast uncertainty. <!--SR:!2025-04-23,24,383!2025-04-24,25,383-->
  - capital budgeting / project ::@:: A project typically consists of 3 stages: initial outlay \(usually last for 1 year\), on-going cash flows, terminal cash flow \(usually occurs at the same time as the last on-going cash flow\). <!--SR:!2025-04-23,24,383!2025-04-24,25,383-->
- [free cash flow](../../../../general/free%20cash%20flow.md) \(FCF\) ::@:: It is the amount by which a business's operating cash flow exceeds its working capital needs and expenditures on fixed assets (known as capital expenditures). It is that portion of cash flow that can be extracted from a company and distributed to creditors and securities holders without causing issues in its operations. <!--SR:!2025-04-18,19,363!2025-04-18,19,363-->
  - free cash flow / steps ::@:: Estimate incremental earnings of a project \(EBIT – tax\) from a _pro forma_ \(forecasted\) income statement. Convert them into free cash flows. <p> Note that incremental earnings are not actual cash flows. <!--SR:!2025-04-24,25,383!2025-04-23,24,383-->
- capital expenditure
- operating expense
- free cash flow
  - free cash flow / tax ::@:: Calculated as EBIT × _marginal_ corporate tax rate. It is a cash outflow. If negative, it becomes _tax credit_ and is a cash inflow. \(In accounting, the treatment of taxes is much more complicated.\) <p> Note that since FCF is usually _unlevered_, i.e. exclude effects of debt, tax shield due to interest expense is ignored. This explains why tax is calculated using EBIT instead of \(EBIT – interest\), even though the _actual_ tax is based on the latter. <!--SR:!2025-04-25,26,383!2025-04-24,25,383-->
  - free cash flow / incremental earnings ::@:: Note that since FCF is usually _unlevered_, i.e. exclude effects of debt, tax shield due to interest expense is ignored. Or equivalently, the incremental earning calculates tax using EBIT instead of \(EBIT – interest\). <!--SR:!2025-04-23,24,383!2025-04-16,17,363-->
  - free cash flow / interest expense ::@:: Interest expense and tax shield due to interest expense is not included. <p> The motivation is FCF is cash distributable to both stockholders and _debt holders_. So a project should be judged with its operating cost, not financing cost. <p> The debt—equity mix should be considered separately. <!--SR:!2025-04-25,26,383!2025-04-18,19,363-->
  - free cash flow / depreciation ::@:: Depreciation is based on accounting rules, and generally does not equal economic life of the asset. So it is possible for cash inflow due to depreciation to last shorter or longer than the project life. <!--SR:!2025-04-17,18,363!2025-04-24,25,383-->
