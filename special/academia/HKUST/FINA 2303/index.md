- datetime: 2025-02-07T16:30:00+08:00/2025-02-07T17:50:00+08:00
- topic: time value of money (TVM)
- [time value of money](../../../../general/time%20value%20of%20money.md) ::@:: It refers to the fact that there is normally a greater benefit to receiving a sum of money now rather than an identical sum later. It may be seen as an implication of the later-developed concept of time preference.
  - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis ::@:: Consider the _present value_ cost and benefits of a decision. If cost is larger than benefit, then _reject_. If cost is smaller than benefit, then _accept_. Otherwise, you are _indifferent_ to the decision.
    - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis / example ::@:: Your company needs to make a decision. How should the managers decide whether to proceed or not? <p> Identify the _present value_ costs and benefits.
    - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis / present value costs ::@:: e.g. additional maintenance, construction costs, increase in labor costs, land purchase
    - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis / present value benefits ::@:: e.g. better volume discounts, increased profit/margins, increased scales
    - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis / present value ::@:: The best way to compute this is converting the costs and benefit in terms of _cash today_, e.g. _current_ market prices.
- [valuation](../../../../general/valuation%20(finance).md) ::@:: the process of determining the value of a (potential) investment, asset, or security
  - valuation / principle ::@:: objective: to maximize value <p> steps: Identify costs and benefits. Convert costs and benefits into _today's_ cash, e.g. using _current_ market prices. Compare costs and benefits to decide if you accept the decision. The calculated number is _net present value_ (NPV).
    - valuation / principle / irrelevant values ::@:: They include your future expectations (e.g. the value would increase), your personal preferences (e.g. preferring A over B, even though the market price of A is lower than B). <p> Two points to note: <br/> 1. Market prices reflect the average preference of everyone for an item. Even if you value it higher or lower, you still buy/sell using the market price. So only market prices matter. <br/> 2. Your future expectations do not matter since you are making the decision _now_. For example, if you expect the price of an item will increase, and it does increase later such that iit changes your decision, you will make such a decision _in the future_. But your _current_ decision is still unaffected.
- [law of one price](../../../../general/law%20of%20one%20price.md) ::@:: In the absence of trade frictions (such as transport costs and tariffs), and under conditions of free _competition_ and price flexibility (where no individual sellers or buyers have power to manipulate prices and prices can freely adjust), _identical goods_ sold at _different locations_ should be sold for the _same price_ when prices are expressed in a common currency.
  - law of one price / mechanism ::@:: This law is derived from the assumption of the inevitable _elimination of all arbitrage_.
- [arbitrage](../../../../general/arbitrage.md) ::@:: The practice of taking advantage of a difference in prices in two or more markets – striking a combination of matching deals to capitalize on the difference, the profit being the difference between the market prices at which the unit is traded.
  - arbitrage / effect ::@:: Arbitrage has the effect of causing prices of the same or very similar assets in different markets to converge.
- [interest rate](../../../../general/interest%20rate.md) ::@:: It is the amount of interest due per period, as a proportion of the amount lent, deposited, or borrowed (called the principal sum).
  - interest rate / time value of money ::@:: Assume you have a _risk-free_ investment that has a certain interest rate, e.g. depositing in banks. Since it is _risk-free_, the return is guaranteed. <p> So the time value of money over time increases. Compare 1 dollar _now_ vs 1 dollar _later_. The 1 dollar now can be invested in this _risk-free_ investment to earn more in the future. So 1 dollar _now_ is more worth than 1 dollar _later_. <p> By this, given a certain amount of money _now_, we can use the _risk-free_ interest rate to compute its _future_ time value. In reverse, given a certain amount of money _in the future_, we can use the _risk-free_ interest rate to compute its _present_ time value, doing the reversed operation.
    - interest rate / time value of money / aliases ::@:: cost of capital, discount rate, hurdle rate, interest rate, opportunity cost of capital, required rate of return
  - interest rate / _risk-free_ interest rate, discount rate, $r_f$ ::@:: The interest rate at which money can be borrowed or lent without risk. By depositing money, we convert money today into money in the future. By borrowing money, we exchange money in the future for money today.
  - interest rate / interest rate factor ::@:: It is the rate of exchange _from_ dollars today _to_ dollars in the future, calculated as $(1 + r_f)^t$.
  - interest rate / discount factor ::@:: It is the rate of exchange between dollars _from_ the future _to_ dollars today, calculated as $1 / (1 + r_f)^t$.
- [net present value](../../../../general/net%20present%20value.md) (NPV) ::@:: net present value (NPV) = present value (benefits/cash inflows) − present value (costs/cash outflows)

- datetime: 2025-02-12T16:30:00+08:00/2025-02-12T17:50:00+08:00
- topic: time value of money (TVM)
- time value of money
  - time value of money / cost—benefit analysis
- finance
  - finance / valuation principles
- law of one price
- time value of money
  - time value of money / timeline ::@:: This tool can visualize cash inflows and outflows easily. It is a number line staring from time 0 on the left. Label cash inflows (positive; e.g. return), cash outflows (negative; e.g. investments), and their amounts under the number line.
  - time value of money / future value ::@:: Move the cash flow forward in time: $FV = PV \cdot (1 + r)^t$, where $t$ is the number of time periods forward (beware of off-by-one error).
    - time value of money / future value / compounding ::@:: Future value uses compound interest instead of simple interest. In the former, interest is earned on principal only. In the latter, interest is earned on principal and interest received. <p> Given a long enough time, compound interest gives much money money than simple interest. On a graph, compound interest increases exponentially while simple interest increases linearly.
  - time value of money / present value ::@:: Move the cash flow backward in time: $PV = \frac {FV} {(1 + r)^t}$, where $t$ is the number of time periods backwards (beware of off-by-one error).
  - time value of money / combining cash flow ::@:: Only cash flows at the same time can be added together. Cash flows at different time must be converted to cash flows at the same time by either compounding or discounting cash flows.
- [financial calculator](../../../../general/financial%20calculator.md)
  - financial calculator / common acronyms ::@:: CPT: compute (compute the missing value from the other 4 values), FV: future value, N: number of periods, I: interest rate per period (in percentage), PMT: annuity payment, PV: present value
  - financial calculator / hints ::@:: Remember to clear out registers between different questions. <br/> Interest rate is usually in percentage. Avoid rounding off intermediate values: use registers to store values. <br/> Negative values are cash outflows while positive values are cash inflows.
- time value of money
  - time value of money / finding number of periods ::@:: $N = \frac {\ln(FV / PV)} {\ln(1 + r)} = \frac {\ln FV - \ln PV} {\ln(1 + r)}$, which has units of period (usually year)
  - time value of money / finding interest rate ::@:: $r = (FV / PV)^{1 / N} - 1$
- [rule of 72](../../../../general/rule%20of%2072.md) (or 70 or 69.3) ::@:: How long does it take to double your investment? This rule gives a rough approximation. <p> The rule states, to double your investment, the interest rate per period in _percentage_ multiplied by the number of periods should be approximately 72.

- topic: time value of money: valuing cash flow streams
- time value of money
  - time value of money / timeline
  - time value of money / combining cash flow
  - time value of money / multiple cash flows ::@:: annuity (annuity due, ordinary annuity), perpetuity; growing annuity, growing perpetuity
- [perpetuity](../../../../general/perpetuity.md) ::@:: It is an annuity that has no end, or a stream of cash payments that continues forever.
  - perpetuity / intuition ::@:: You want to earn $C$ at the end of each year forever (excluding year 0). <p> Assuming the interest rate $r$ is fixed. Then you need to invest $P = C / r$ at year 0. This $P$ is also how one calculates the present value of a perpetuity.
  - perpetuity / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = C / r$$ <p> This equation assumes the first payment is at first year end. Multiply by $1 + r$ if the first payment is at first year start, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period.
  - perpetuity / present value ::@:: Notice that the present value is always the same when evaluated at any time.
- [annuity](../../../../general/annuity.md) ::@:: It is a series of payments made at equal intervals.
  - annuity / types ::@:: ordinary annuity: payment is made at period end, annuity due: payment is made at period start
  - annuity / relation to perpetuity ::@:: You can interpret as an annuity as a perpetuity that you transfer away to others for free at annuity end (after getting the cash flow for annuity end). <p> This gives the equation for an annuity directly by subtracting the PV of the perpetuity at annuity end from the PV of perpetuity at annuity start.
  - annuity / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = \frac C r \left(1 - \frac 1 {(1 + r)^t} \right) \,,$$ where $t$ is the number of periods. <p> This equation assumes the annuity is an ordinary annuity. For annuity due, multiply by $1 + r$, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period.
  - annuity / equation for FV ::@:: Just multiply the PV formula by $(1 + r)^t$, where $t$ is the number of periods in the future. This is because the annuity has the same value as a lump-sum of PV amount. <p> This changes the above equation to: $$FV = \frac C r \left((1 + r)^t - 1 \right) \,,$$ if $FV$ is evaluated at the annuity end.

- topic: time value of money: valuing cash flow streams
- perpetuity
  - perpetuity / equation for PV
- annuity
  - annuity / equation for PV
  - annuity / equation for FV
- perpetuity
  - perpetuity / growing ::@:: The payment grows exponentially instead of staying constant. It continues forever. <p> More precisely, the first payment starts at $C$, and then each year after it grows by $g$ (multiplied by $1 + g$).
    - perpetuity / growing / intuition ::@:: Recall the intuition for non-growing perpetuity. <p> Then for growing perpetuity, your earnings grows by $g$ (multiplied by $1 + g$) each year after the first year. That means the principal in the fund will need to grow by $g$ as well. That means the interested you have earned on the principal needs to be separated into two parts: one to grow the principal by $g$, the other to provide the payment. The payment you actually obtain is $r - g$ of the principal then. <p> ou want to earn $C$ at the end of each year forever (excluding year 0). Assuming the interest rate $r$ is fixed. Then you need to invest $P = C / (r - g)$ at year 0. This $P$ is also how one calculates the present value of a growing perpetuity.
    - perpetuity / growing / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = \frac C {r - g}$$ <p> This equation assumes the first payment is at first year end. Multiply by $1 + r$ if the first payment is at first year start, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period.
    - perpetuity / growing / present value ::@:: Notice that the present value is _not_ always the same when evaluated at any time. Rather, it grows by $g$ (multiplied by $1 + g$) each year.
- annuity
  - annuity / growing ::@:: The payment grows exponentially instead of staying constant. It ends after some time. <p> More precisely, the first payment starts at $C$, and then each year after it grows by $g$ (multiplied by $1 + g$), until the annuity ends.
    - annuity / growing / relation to perpetuity ::@:: The relation is exactly the same, but with growing payments instead of constant payments.
    - annuity / growing / equation for PV ::@:: $$PV = \frac C {r - g} \left(1 - \frac {(1 + g)^t} {(1 + r)^t} \right) \,,$$ where $t$ is the number of periods. <p> This equation assumes the annuity is an ordinary annuity. For annuity due, multiply by $1 + r$, which advances all payments backward in time by 1 period.
    - annuity / growing / equation for FV ::@:: Just multiply the PV formula by $(1 + r)^t$, where $t$ is the number of periods in the future. This is because the growing annuity has the same value as a lump-sum of PV amount. <p> This changes the above equation to: $$FV = \frac C {r - g} \left((1 + r)^t - (1 + g)^t \right) \,,$$ if $FV$ is evaluated at the annuity end.
- time value of money
  - time value of money / rearranging formulas ::@:: Note that the formulas can be used flexibly. That is, it can be used for more than finding the variable at LHS. In fact, if you have all variables except for one, you can rearrange the equations to find the missing variable. <p> However, there are exceptions not having closed-form algebraic expressions... Interest rate is one of them.
- annuity
  - annuity / finding cash flow ::@:: Rearrange the formulas appropriately to find the cash flow/payment. Actually it is too simple that I will not list the equation here...
  - annuity / finding interest rate ::@:: As mentioned above, there is no closed-form algebraic expression for finding the interest rate from other variables. <p> You can either use a financial calculator, or do trial-and-error (which is what calculators are doing behind the scenes...).
    - annuity / finding interest rate / financial calculator ::@:: Simple, just fill in the other variables _properly_ and leave out the interest rate...
    - annuity / finding interest rate / trial-and-error ::@:: Using intuition, guess an interest rate. Calculate the value for another variable assuming that interest rate. Observe the error between the actual value of that other variable. Using intuition, guess if the interest rate needs to be higher or lower, and by how much. Repeat until you get a good enough answer. <p> (The instructor told us that we will not need to calculate the exact value... But we still need to know how to guess.)
  - annuity / finding number of periods ::@:: Given present value (money you have now) $PV$, future value (money to save) $PV$, interest rate $r$, and _ordinary_ annuity payment $C$, we can derive the equation for number of periods $t$: $$\begin{aligned} FV & = PV (1 + r)^t + \frac C r \left((1 + r)^t - 1 \right) \\ (1 + r)^t & = \frac {FV + \frac C r} {PV + \frac C r} = \frac {r \cdot FV + C} {r \cdot PV + C} \\ t & = \frac {\ln(r \cdot FV + C) - \ln(r \cdot FV + C)} {\ln(1 + r)} \,. \end{aligned} \,,$$ So the equation is the last expression, for those without a financial calculator.
    - annuity / finding number of periods / intuition ::@:: Observe the equation: $$t = \frac {\ln(r \cdot FV + C) - \ln(r \cdot FV + C)} {\ln(1 + r)} \,.$$ You can see $r \cdot FV + C$ would have been the next payment after the annuity ends if the annuity had not ended. $r \cdot PV + C$ is the first payment. This is interesting... it seems like it somehow relates to the growth...
