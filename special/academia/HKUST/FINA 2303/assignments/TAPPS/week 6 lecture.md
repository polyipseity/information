# thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS) - week 6 lecture

- thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS)

## problem

|                                 |              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------:|
| Sales                           | \$1&nbsp;000 |
| Cost of goods sold              | −500         |
| Selling expense                 | −100         |
| Depreciation                    | −100         |
| &emsp;Operating profit \(EBIT\) | 300          |
| Tax 34%                         | −102         |
| Net income                      | 198          |

Suppose the company reported an additional \$100 million depreciation expense. What would be the change in the company's earnings and cash flow?

In Jan 2020, a firm buys a new processing plant through a new loan. The acquisition of the plant is a capital expenditure and will be depreciated over its life.

How would this transaction be recorded on Jan 2020 and Dec 2020's balance sheet, the income statement for year 2020, and the cash flow statement for year 2020?

## submission

Net income _decreases_ by 100 \* \(1 – 34%\) = \$66 million. Cash flow _increases_ by 100 \* 34% = \$34 million.

- balance sheet
  - January: fixed assets increases, liability increases
  - December: fixed assets decreases, equity decreases
- income statement
  - depreciation expense increases
  - net income decreases
- cash flow statement
  - operating cash flow increases due to depreciation
  - investment cash flow decreases due to capital expenditure
  - financing cash flow is unknown, since debt increases it but debt interest decreases it
