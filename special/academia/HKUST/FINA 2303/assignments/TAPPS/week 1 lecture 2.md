# thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS) - week 1 lecture 2

- HKUST FINA 2303
- thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS)

## problem

You have just won a contest. You can choose between choose 2 prizes:

1. 4 tickets (face value: \$400 each, eBay price: \$300 each) to a ballet dance performance
2. 2 tickets (face value: \$450 each, eBay price: \$500 each) to your favorite band

Which prize should you claim and why?

## submission

Because I can sell the 4 tickets for \$1200, then I can use the money to buy 2 of my favorite band tickets and ear another \$200. The benefits exceeds the costs.

We do not consider the face value since we trade the tickets at market price.
