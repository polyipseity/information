# thinking aloud paired problem solving \(TAPPS\) - week 10 lecture

- HKUST FINA 2303
- thinking aloud paired problem solving \(TAPPS\)

## problem

A currently 20-year bond with a coupon rate of 12% paid semi-annually was sold at a price of \$1&nbsp;171.59 2 years ago. Its par value is \$1&nbsp;000. Assume YTM remains constant.

1. What is its YTM?
2. What is its current market price? Compare it with the price 2 years ago.

## submission

1. Using the formula, we get about 10.05% \(APR\).
2. The price must be lower than 2 years ago \(approaching the par value\).
