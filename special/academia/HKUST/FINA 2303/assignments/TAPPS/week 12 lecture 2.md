# thinking aloud paired problem solving \(TAPPS\) - week 12 lecture 2

- thinking aloud paired problem solving \(TAPPS\)

## problem

Assume the distribution of returns of a stock is roughly normal. The following are annual returns of the stock from 2014 to 2016:

| Year | Annual Return |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 2014 | 12%           |
| 2015 | 15%           |
| 2016 | –6%           |

1. Given the variance of the stock’s returns is 0.0129 \(129%<sup>2</sup>\), how likely that the return in 2017 would lie in the range of –15.72% to 29.72%?
2. Can you be 95% confident that this stock will not lose more than 20% of its value next year?

## submission

1. standard deviation = 0.113578 <br/>
    mean = 0.07 = 7%

    Z-score for 29.72% = 2 <br/>
    Z-score for –15.72% = –2

    probability = 95%
2. yes
