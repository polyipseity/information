# thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS) - week 8 lecture

## problem

A 5-year 10% semiannual coupon bond with face value of \$1&nbsp;000 is being sold at a price of \$950.

1. What is its yield to maturity?
2. What is the expected rate of return if you buy it at the market price?

A 5-year 10% semiannual coupon bond with face value of $1000 is being sold with a yield of 9%.

What is its market price?

## submission

1. After inputting the cash flows into a financial calculator:
    - PV: â€“950
    - payment: 50
    - periods: 10
    - FV: 1000
    - interest: \(empty\)
  
    The calculated yield to maturity is about 5.67%. We want the yield to maturity in APR, so multiply it by 2 to get 11.34%.
2. The expected rate of return is simply the yield to maturity, since YTM is defined as the discount rate at which the present value of all future cash flows from the bond is equal to the current price of the bond.

Without doing calculation, the market price of the bond is higher than its face value of \$1k. The yield being lower than the coupon rate means the bond is selling at a premium, i.e. above its face value.
