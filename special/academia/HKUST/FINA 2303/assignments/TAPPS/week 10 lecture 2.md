# thinking aloud paired problem solving \(TAPPS\) - week 10 lecture 2

- HKUST FINA 2303
- thinking aloud paired problem solving \(TAPPS\)

## problem

Suppose you expect firm X to pay an annual dividend of 3 dollars per share in the coming year. You also expect its shares to trade for 107 dollars per share at the end of the year. Suppose investments with equivalent risk to firm X's stock have an expected return of 10%.

1. What is the most that you would pay for firm X's stock today?
2. Given the price you would pay, what is the expected return of investing in this stock?
3. What are your expected dividend yield and capital gain rate?

## submission

1. \(3+107\)/\(1+10%\)=\$100
2. 10%
3. 3/100=3%
4. \(107â€“100\)/100=7%
