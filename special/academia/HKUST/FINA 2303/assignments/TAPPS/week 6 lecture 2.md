# thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS) - week 6 lecture 2

## problem

Kurt's Kabinets is evaluating a project that will require \$80&nbsp;000 in fixed assets at year 0. The project is expected to produce sales of \$110&nbsp;000 with associated costs of \$70&nbsp;000 annually. The project has a 4-year life. The company uses straight-line depreciation to a zero book value over the life of the project. The tax rate is 35%.

What is the incremental earnings for this project for each year from year 1 to year 4?

## submission

incremental earnings = \(sales – cost – depreciation\) \* \(1 – tax rate\) = \(110000 – 70000 – 80000/4\) \* \(1 – 35%\) = 13000
