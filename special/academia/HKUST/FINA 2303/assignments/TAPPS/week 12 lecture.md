# thinking aloud paired problem solving \(TAPPS\) - week 12 lecture

- HKUST FINA 2303
- thinking aloud paired problem solving \(TAPPS\)

## problem

Consider a stock with the following three annual returns in year 1, 2 and 3: 10%, 8%, and −4%.

1. What are the arithmetic and geometric average annual rate of returns over the three year period?
2. If you invest \$100 at the beginning of year 1, how much will you have at the end of year 3?
3. Suppose your friend plans to invest in this stock for the next year, and assume probabilities of having 10%, 8%, and −4% returns in the coming year are equal. What will be the expected payoff of an investment of \$100?

## submission

1. arithmetic average = \(14/3\)% <br/>
    geometric average = $$\sqrt[3]{(1.1)(1.08)(0.96)} - 1 \approx 0.0447905229 = 4.47905229\% \,.$$
2. Use the geometric average: $$100 \times (1 + 0.0447905229)^3 \approx \$114.048 \,.$$
3. Use the arithmetic average: $$100 \times (1 + (14/3)\%) \approx \$104.666667 \,.$$
