- thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS)

## problem

|                                 |              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------:|
| Sales                           | \$1&nbsp;000 |
| Cost of goods sold              | −500         |
| Selling expense                 | −100         |
| Depreciation                    | −100         |
| &emsp;Operating profit \(EBIT\) | 300          |
| Tax 34%                         | −102         |
| Net income                      | 198          |

Suppose out of the \$1&nbsp;000 million sales, \$800 million was credit sales. What would be the company's cash flow?

## submission

cash flow = cash sales − cost of goods sold − selling expense − taxes = 200 − 500 − 100 − 102 = −\$502 million
