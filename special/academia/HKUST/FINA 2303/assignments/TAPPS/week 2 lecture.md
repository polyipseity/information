# thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS) - week 2 lecture

- HKUST FINA 2303
- thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS)

## problem

Your cousin Eva wants to take some time off in five years to go traveling in Europe for six months. She estimates that her trip will cost \$120&nbsp;000 in today's dollars.

1. If inflation is running 3% a year, what should Eva's financial goal be for the trip?
2. Eva has just received a bonus of \$120&nbsp;000 and she plans to put the money in a fixed deposit account with 4% annual interest rate. She is hoping that by earning the interests, she can have extra money to buy some souvenirs in Europe as gifts. How much is the amount of extra money for gifts that Eva will have?

## submission

1. Answer: $$\$120\,000 \times (1 + 3\%)^5 \approx \$139112.889$$
2. Answer: $$\$120\,000 \times \left((1 + 4\%)^5 - (1 + 3\%)^5\right) \approx \$6885.45937$$
