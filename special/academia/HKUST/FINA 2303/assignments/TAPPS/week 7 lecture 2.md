# thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS) - week 7 lecture 2

- thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS)

## problem

A company paid \$90k, in cash, for a piece of equipment three years ago. Its current book value is \$30k. The company no longer uses this equipment in its current operations and has received an offer of \$50k from a firm who would like to purchase it. The company is in a 30% tax bracket. If it decides to sell the equipment, what is the incremental cash flow from selling it?

Your car broke down. You could do nothing with it apart from fixing it. If you fix it, then you can sell it for \$7k.

You have paid \$5k to fix it. You were about to sell it today when it broke down again. You will need to pay \$3k to fix it again.

Will you fix the car or not?

A new computer system that costs \$1M upfront. It will save \$300k annually. The system is depreciated by the accountants using the straight line method over 4 years, with zero salvage value. The financial analysts expect it could be sold for \$50k at the end of year 4. NWC does not change. The corporate marginal tax rate is 40%. The cost of capital is 8%.

Should your company purchase this new computer system?

## submission

The gain is \$20k. The tax due is \$6k. The incremental CF is found by subtracting \$6k from the sale price \$50k, which is \$44k.

---

Yes. The \$5k is a sunk cost. The incremental benefit is \$7k. The incremental cost is \$3k. As the incremental benefit exceeds the incremental cost, the car should be fixed \(and sold\).

The _incremental_ FCF are:

- year 0: –1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000
- year 1: 300&nbsp;000×\(1 - 40%\)+250&nbsp;000×40%
- year 2: 300&nbsp;000×\(1 - 40%\)+250&nbsp;000×40%
- year 3: 300&nbsp;000×\(1 - 40%\)+250&nbsp;000×40%
- year 4: 300&nbsp;000×\(1 - 40%\)+250&nbsp;000×40%+50&nbsp;000×\(1 - 40%\)

The steps are omitted here, but you can calculate the NPV of the above incremental FCF using the 8% cost of capital and see if the NPV is nonnegative.
