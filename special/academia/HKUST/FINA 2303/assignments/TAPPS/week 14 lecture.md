# thinking aloud paired problem solving \(TAPPS\) - week 14 lecture

- HKUST FINA 2303
- thinking aloud paired problem solving \(TAPPS\)

## problem

|           | standard deviation | beta |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---- |
| Target    | 20%                | 1.25 |
| Starbucks | 30%                | 0.95 |

If both stocks have the same expected return, which one will you buy? Why?

---

Consider the asset with a beta of 1.5. The risk-free rate is 6% and market risk premium is 9.5%. The asset has an expected return of 15% given its current price.

1. Where will the return of this asset plot on the graph of the SML?
2. Is the asset underpriced, fairly priced, or overpriced?

## submission

SolarWinds has a higher beta and a higher systematic risk, and the expected return is the same, so the risk-free return of SolarWinds is lower, and we should invest in Rackspace.

If we assume they are wrongly priced, then either Rackspace is underpriced or SolarWinds is overpriced.

Alternatively, if we assume they are correctly priced, then Rackspace has a higher risk-free return rate.

Both cases yield an arbitrage opportunity.

6%+9.5%\*1.5=20.25%&gt;15%, so the return of asset is lower than SML. So it is overpriced.
