# thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS) - week 2 lecture 2

- HKUST FINA 2303
- thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS)

## problem

Suppose you have a chance to invest in a small business. By providing the owner with a sum of \$220&nbsp;000 today, in return you will receive yearly payments of \$50&nbsp;000 for the next six years.

Similar types of investment opportunities will pay 10%.

Should you accept this investment and why?

## submission

Calculate the PV of benefits: $$PV(B) = \frac {50\,000} {10\%} \left(1 - \frac 1 {(1 + 10\%)^6} \right) \approx 217763.035 \,.$$ This is less than the PV of costs, which is simply \$220&nbsp;000. So we should reject this investment.
