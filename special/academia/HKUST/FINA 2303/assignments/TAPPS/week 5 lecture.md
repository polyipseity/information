# thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS) - week 5 lecture

- HKUST FINA 2303
- thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS)

## problem

|                    | Project A    | Project B     |
| ------------------ |:------------:|:-------------:|
| Initial Investment | \$1&nbsp;000 | \$10&nbsp;000 |
| NPV                | \$600        | \$1&nbsp;900  |
| IRR                | 50%          | 20%           |
| Cost of Capital    | 12%          | 12%           |

If projects A and B are mutually exclusive, which project should you choose and why?

Tips: no calculation needed.

| Year | Project A    | Project B    |
|:----:|:------------:|:------------:|
| 0    | –50&nbsp;000 | –28&nbsp;000 |
| 1    | 26&nbsp;000  | 15&nbsp;000  |
| 2    | 26&nbsp;000  | 15&nbsp;000  |
| 3    | 26&nbsp;000  | 15&nbsp;000  |

Projects A and B are mutually exclusive. Your cost of capital is 15%. Compute the crossover point \(incremental IRR\) in order to rank the projects.

| Model | 0    | 1   | 2   | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|:-----:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| A     | –300 | –5  | –5  | –5 | –5 | –5 |
| B     | –100 | –30 | –30 |    |    |    |

Your firm is choosing between two models for its network server, with the costs shown above. At a cost of capital of 10%, which model should your firm choose? Why?

## submission

Project B, because its NPV is higher than that of project A.

---

Subtracting from project A \(larger\) project B \(smaller\), we have the following cash flows starting from year 0: –22&nbsp;000, 11&nbsp;000, 11&nbsp;000, 11&nbsp;000. Its internal rate of return is about 23.375%. As it is higher than the cost of capital, we accept the "alternative" project, project A.

---

Model A lasts for 5 years and has a NPV of about –318.953934. Model B lasts for 2 years and has a NPV of about –152.066116. Model A's EAA is about -84.1392442. Model B's EAA is about -87.6190476. As Model A's EAA is higher \(lower EAC\), we choose Model A.
