# thinking aloud paired problem solving \(TAPPS\) - week 14 lecture 2

## problem

The long-term debt of your firm is currently selling for 95% of its face value. The issue matures in 10 years and pays an annual coupon of 6%, yielding 6.7%. The firm's marginal tax rate is 30%.

What is the effective cost of debt to your firm?

---

A company wants to calculate its cost of capital. It currently has \$140 mil of retained earnings, \$40 mil of new debt and \$20 mil of new preferred stock.

- tax rate = 34%
- current YTM on debt = 9.09%
- cost of preferred stock = 10%
- cost of common stock = 16%

Find the weighted average cost of capital for the firm.

## submission

6.7%\*\(1â€“30%\)=4.69%

---

Retained earnings can be considered the market value of common stock. WACC is: $$\frac {9.09\% (1 - 34\%) (40) + 10\% (20) + 16\% (140)} {40 + 20 + 140} \approx 13.39988\% \,.$$
