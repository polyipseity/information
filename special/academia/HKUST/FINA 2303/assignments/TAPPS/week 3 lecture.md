# thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS) - week 3 lecture

- HKUST FINA 2303
- thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS)

## problem

Suppose your firm needs to purchase a new forklift. The dealer offers you two options:

1. Pay a price of \$40&nbsp;000 if you pay cash for the lump sum now.
2. Make four annual payments of $15,000, no money down.

You can borrow from the bank at an interest rate of 15%.

1. Which option should you take?
2. What is the lending rate that the dealer is charging you? (Compute it if you have a financial calculator.)

## submission

1. The PV of option 2 is about \$42000, which is more expensive than option 2, so choose option 1.
2. It should be larger than 15%.
