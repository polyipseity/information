# thinking aloud paired problem solving \(TAPPS\) - week 11 lecture

- thinking aloud paired problem solving \(TAPPS\)

## problem

A stock recently paid a \$5.00 dividend. The dividend is expected to grow at 10% per year indefinitely. The equity cost of capital of the stock is 15%.

1. What would the most that we are willing to pay for this stock?
2. Given the price that we are willing to pay, what are the expected dividend yield and capital gain rate on the stock?
3. What will be the expected price of the stock 2 years from now?

A company usually earns 15% from its investment. The company expects its earnings per share to be 3 dollars, and will pay a dividend of 1.20 dollars per share in the coming year. What is the company's growth rate?

## submission

1. $D_1 = 5 \times (1+10\%) = \$5.5$

    $P_0 = \frac {D_1} {r - g} = \frac {5.5} {0.15 - 0.1} = \frac {5.5} {0.05} = \$110$
2. Expected dividend yield: $\frac {5.5} {110} \times 100\% = 5\%$

    Capital gain rate is the same as the dividend growth rate: 10%
3. $D_3 = D_1 \times (1+10\%)^2 = \$6.655$

    $P_2 = \frac {6.655} {0.15 - 0.1} = \$133.1$

- retention rate: \(3â€“1.2\)/3=1.8/3=60%
- growth rate: 60%\*15%=9%
