# thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS) - week 4 lecture 2

- HKUST FINA 2303
- thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS)

## problem

Your firm is negotiating a 4 year loan of \$1.5 million with a dealer. The monthly payment is \$40&nbsp;000. Your firm can borrow money from the bank at 12% APR with monthly compounding.

1. What is the IRR of the loan?
2. Should your firm take out this loan? Why?

## submission

1. APR is 12%. Monthly interest rate is 1%. Using a financial calculator, the IRR \(APR; EAR is also accepted\) is 12.675%.
2. This is a loan/delayed investment. As the IRR is higher than the APR, we should reject the loan.
