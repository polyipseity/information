# thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS) - week 7 lecture

- HKUST FINA 2303
- thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS)

## problem

A project:

- projected EBIT = \$700k annually
- cost of equipment = \$90k, straight-line depreciation over 3 years with no salvage value
- product life = 3 years
- interest on borrowing = \$5k annually
- increase in net working capital prior to production = \$20k
- full recovery of net working capital at end of project
- tax rate = 34%
- cost of capital = 20%

What are the incremental free cash flows?

## submission

- depreciation = 90000/3 = 30000
- tax = 700000 \* 0.34 = 238000
- year 0: –90000–20000 = –110000
- year 1 to year 2: 700000–238000+30000 = 492000
- year 3: 700000–238000+30000+20000 = 512000

Interest expense \(and the tax shield on interest expense\) is ignored, since free cash flow is _unlevered_.
