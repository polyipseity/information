# thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS) - week 4 lecture

- thinking aloud paired problem solving (TAPPS)

## problem

An online bank is offering to pay \0.4% interest per month on deposits. Your local bank offers to pay 1.2% interest quarterly (every 3 months).

Which bank offers the higher interest rate?

Suppose Mr. Chan took out a \$3&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 20-year mortgage loan at 3% interest 5 years ago. Mortgage payments are made monthly. What is the outstanding loan balance now?

## submission

Online bank, because they have same APR but the online bank pays more often.

---

APR is 3%. Thus the monthly interest rate is 3%/12=0.25%. The monthly payment is $$\frac {3\,000\,000} {\frac 1 {0.25\%} \left(1 - \frac 1 {(1 + 0.25\%)^{240} } \right) } \,.$$ Finally, the outstanding loan balance is $$\frac {3\,000\,000} {\frac 1 {0.25\%} \left(1 - \frac 1 {(1 + 0.25\%)^{240} } \right) } \frac 1 {0.25\%} \left(1 - \frac 1 {(1 + 0.25\%)^{180} } \right) = 3\,000\,000 \frac {1 - \frac 1 {(1 + 0.25\%)^{180} } } {1 - \frac 1 {(1 + 0.25\%)^{240} } } \approx 2409263 \,.$$
