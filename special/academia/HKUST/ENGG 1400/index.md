- design thinking
  - design thinking / reframing
    - design thinking / reframing / motivation ::@:: In design thinking, we put as much emphasis on _problem finding_ as we do on problem solving. What is the point if you are solving the wrong problem? <!--SR:!2024-11-25,18,362!2024-11-25,18,362-->
- sticky problem ::@:: anchor problem, gravity problem, unclear problem <!--SR:!2024-11-26,19,362!2024-11-27,20,362-->
  - anchor problem ::@:: Problems that _you think_ have only one possible solution. <p> Try to release the anchor to open up more solution possibilities. <!--SR:!2024-11-27,20,362!2024-11-27,20,362-->
  - gravity problem ::@:: Problems that are _not actionable_ objectively. (Sometimes it may be an anchor problem but it seems like a gravity problem because your mind is so anchored on the solution...) <p> Try to accept and reframe the problem. Accept does not mean give up, however. There may be a possibility that the problem becomes actionable later. And you can always try to reframe the problem. <!--SR:!2024-11-26,19,362!2024-11-27,20,362-->
  - unclear problem ::@:: compound/unfocused, inappropriately scoped, insufficient context, problems with only 2 to 3 solutions (yes/no, either/or) <!--SR:!2024-11-27,20,362!2024-11-26,19,362-->
  - sticky problem / reframing ::@:: See what kind of sticky problem you have. Reframe appropriately. Best if the reframed problem starts with "How might I..." <p> Reframing helps with getting the "right" solutions, because the solutions you get highly depends on your framing. <!--SR:!2024-11-26,19,362!2024-11-25,18,362-->
- activity 1: reframing a problem ::@:: We are going to reframe your problem 3 times. In each round, state your problem on a idea board. With other people, add ideas to each others' boards. After each round, reframe your question based on the ideas given by others. <!--SR:!2024-11-27,20,362!2024-11-25,18,362-->
  - activity 1: reframing a problem / takeaways ::@:: You can reframe your questions using ideation with others to get better results! Also, idea boards are a great way to help introverts participate. <!--SR:!2024-11-25,18,362!2024-11-26,19,362-->
- ways of thinking
  - ways of thinking / blocks ::@:: There are ways of thinking that may get you stuck on a problem. They could be cultural/milieu, emotional, intellectual, or perceptual. <!--SR:!2024-11-26,19,362!2024-11-25,18,362-->
    - ways of thinking / blocks / cultural ::@:: embarrassment, fear of failure, uncomfortable with fantasy or intuition <!--SR:!2024-11-27,20,362!2024-11-27,20,362-->
    - ways of thinking / blocks / emotional ::@:: control is good and chaos is bad, no support for new ideas, not supposed to have fun <!--SR:!2024-11-27,20,362!2024-11-25,18,362-->
    - ways of thinking / blocks / intellectual ::@:: expert belief, inflexible style, wrong information <!--SR:!2024-11-27,20,362!2024-11-26,19,362-->
    - ways of thinking / blocks / perceptual ::@:: choosing too tight a view, difficulty isolating, stereotyping <!--SR:!2024-11-27,20,362!2024-11-26,19,362-->

- activity 1: how many uses ::@:: Think of as many uses for a paperclip in 3 minutes. Play intense music. <!--SR:!2024-12-01,23,374!2024-12-01,23,374-->
  - activity 1: how many uses / takeaways ::@:: Did you get stuck? If no, then good! Yes, it is normal. You can improve this by using different _schemas_, collaborating with others, and think in a more relaxed environment (No intense music!). <!--SR:!2024-12-01,23,374!2024-12-01,23,374-->
- activity 2: how many uses, better ::@:: Share with other people on your uses of a paperclip. Then, think of as many uses for a paperclip in 3 minutes again. Play relaxing music. <!--SR:!2024-12-01,23,374!2024-12-03,25,374-->
  - activity 2: how many uses, better / takeaways ::@:: Making use of different schemas, radical collaboration with others, and a relaxing environment helps with ideation and brainstorming. And most importantly, practice more! <!--SR:!2024-12-02,24,374!2024-12-03,25,374-->

  - design thinking / mindfulness of process ::@:: Being aware of where you are in the design thinking process is important, because it informs your approach. <p> Some example questions are: Are you _rushing to a solution_? Are you blocked? Are you energized by certain activities and drained by others? <!--SR:!2024-12-03,25,374!2024-12-03,25,374-->
  - design thinking / design for someone else ::@:: What does someone else need? You can _think differently_: "Need" is a verb (generates more opportunities), not a noun (immediate solution). Also, think of _insights_. <!--SR:!2024-12-03,25,374!2024-12-03,25,374-->
- activity 4: design a wallet for your partner ::@:: 3 people form a group. 2 people interview the other person and co-design a wallet for them. Repeat this 3 times for each person. <!--SR:!2024-12-03,25,374!2024-12-01,23,374-->
  - activity 4: design a wallet for your partner / takeaways ::@:: If you are the interviewee, you should walk people through your ideal wallet. <p> If you are the interviewer, take notes, listen to stories, and ask why 5 times (5 times is a guideline). <p> Finally, when brainstorming ideas, build on the ideas of others, defer judgement, encourage wild ideas, and go for volume! <!--SR:!2024-12-01,23,374!2024-11-25,17,354-->
- point of view statement ::@:: (user) needs a way to (verb) because (surprising insight). <!--SR:!2024-12-03,25,374!2024-12-03,25,374-->

  - wild ideas / motivation ::@:: If you do not try to think of "wild ideas", often your ideas ends up "inside the box", respecting your assumptions. Thinking of "wild ideas" can help break your assumptions. <!--SR:!2024-12-01,23,374!2024-12-01,23,374-->
  - wild ideas / brainstorming ::@:: Frame a good question, ideally starting with "How might I...". Warm up your brain. Brainstorm many ideas using rules, ideally with other people.

  - decision making / gather & create ::@:: Try to gather more choices beyond the binary! <p> _Luck_ is about being open to more than just the task at hand. Anxiety disrupts people's ability to notice the unexpected. Those who call themselves lucky actively sought opportunities to meet new people and have new experiences. (Richard Wiseman, _The Luck Factor_) <!--SR:!2024-12-03,25,374!2024-12-03,25,374-->

    - decision making / narrow down / matrix ::@:: Instead of listing the pros and cons of each choice, create a matrix. The column headers are the choices while the row headers are the objectives. Then assess each choice for each objective, ideally using emotional symbols (e.g. smiley face, neutral face, sad face). Use the matrix to remove the worst choices. <!--SR:!2024-12-01,23,374!2024-12-03,25,374-->
- design thinking
  - design thinking / discernment ::@:: __Discernment__ is integrating _multiple_ ways of knowing, which includes cognitive/intellectual, emotional/affective, physical/kinesthetic, and social. <!--SR:!2024-12-01,23,374!2024-12-01,23,374-->

- decision making
  - decision making / choose ::@:: When choosing, self-awareness is very important. Try to be aware of how others have influenced your choice and whether such influences are good. Examples of influence include: You are told that you should work in a certain occupation. <!--SR:!2024-12-03,25,374!2024-12-01,23,374-->
  - decision making / let go & move on ::@:: After making a choice, treat it as irreversible. Try to enter a "cycle of non-regret". <p> It turns out your brain will "synthesize" happiness for an irreversible choice, kinda like "wanting what you get", not "getting what you want". Keeping your choice open inhibits the above, and may make you worse since you will have lower happiness and poorer performance. <!--SR:!2024-12-03,25,374!2024-12-01,23,374-->
    - decision making / let go & move on / quotes ::@:: Quality of the decision does not equal quality of the outcome. (You cannot fully control the outcome for most things.) <p> Consequences of choices cannot influence choice itself. (Try to _really_ understand this seemingly-wrong sentence again...) <!--SR:!2024-12-01,23,374!2024-12-03,25,374-->
