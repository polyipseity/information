## week 5 tutorial

- time: 2024-10-03T10:30:00+08:00/2024-10-03T12:20:00+08:00
- activity 1: practice ideation through 3 things ::: Person A names a category, and then person B names 3 things that fit into the category. Afterwards, everyone shouts "Three things!". Repeat this to practice ideation and avoid filtering ideas.
- success ::: What is your definition of __success__? Where does your belief come from? Are some of them dysfunctional?
  - success / dysfunctional belief ::: An example is "You should know where you are going by now." Yet, life stages have lengthened and delayed compared to before... (except for retirement age)
  - success / idea board ::: With other people, ideate your definitions of success and their sources if known. Post them on sticky notes on an idea board. Then, categorize the definitions. Finally, look at the idea board together and discuss about any interesting thing you have found.
- design thinking
  - design thinking / life design: empathize ::: The amazing people you meet and the understanding/perspectives you give _and_ receive.
  - design thinking / life design: define ::: Think about who you are, where you are, and what is _really_ important to you.
  - design thinking / life design: ideate ::: You give yourself permission to have unreserved thoughts, drawings, imaginations, and hopes. Also let the ideas of others in.
  - design thinking / life design: prototype ::: You build simply and accessibly.
  - design thinking / life design: test ::: You try things curiously and courageously.
  - design thinking / reframing ::: Framing defines the boundaries and constraints of the solution set to your problem. __Reframing__ state the original problem but in a different perspective to expand the solution set. There may be unexpected innovation.
- job hunting ::: Finding a job... or pursuing possibilities that give me choices and freedom (reframing)?
  - job hunting / iceberg problem ::: visible job market (agency, jobs board, social media): 30%; hidden market (HR connection, direct application, networking): 70%
- design thinking
  - design thinking / curiosity ::: Curiosity makes everything new and invites exploration. It helps us notice new opportunities and connect with people. It allows us to look beyond preconceptions and be open to possibilities.
  - design thinking / bias toward action ::: Designers test things out. They run small experiments and prototypes as opportunities to learn, regardless of outcome. They try things and iterate toward success, rather than waiting until they can get it "right" at the first time.
  - design thinking / flare & focus ::: flare: create options, divergent thinking; focus: select options, convergent thinking
- information interview ::: Not a job interview, but a conversation looking for others' stories.
  - information interview / invitation ::: Who are you? How do you relate to them? Why them? What do you want to find out? And finally, ask them.
  - information interview / best practices ::: ask for 3 more referrals, be genuinely curious, buy coffee, in person > virtual > by phone, thank you note
  - information interview / culture ::: Be aware of cultural differences. Ask and observe.
  - information interview / takeaways ::: People will help (refer) you if you ask. You will help (refer) someone back eventually...

## week 7 tutorial

- time: 2024-10-17T10:30:00+08:00/2024-10-17T12:20:00+08:00
- design thinking
  - design thinking / reframing
    - design thinking / reframing / motivation ::: In design thinking, we put as much emphasis on _problem finding_ as we do on problem solving. What is the point if you are solving the wrong problem?
- sticky problem ::: anchor problem, gravity problem, unclear problem
  - anchor problem ::: Problems that _you think_ have only one possible solution. <p> Try to release the anchor to open up more solution possibilities.
  - gravity problem ::: Problems that are _not actionable_ objectively. (Sometimes it may be an anchor problem but it seems like a gravity problem because your mind is so anchored on the solution...) <p> Try to accept and reframe the problem. Accept does not mean give up, however. There may be a possibility that the problem becomes actionable later. And you can always try to reframe the problem.
  - unclear problem ::: compound/unfocused, inappropriately scoped, insufficient context, problems with only 2 to 3 solutions (yes/no, either/or)
  - sticky problem / reframing ::: See what kind of sticky problem you have. Reframe appropriately. Best if the reframed problem starts with "How might I..." <p> Reframing helps with getting the "right" solutions, because the solutions you get highly depends on your framing.
- activity 1: reframing a problem ::: We are going to reframe your problem 3 times. In each round, state your problem on a idea board. With other people, add ideas to each others' boards. After each round, reframe your question based on the ideas given by others.
  - activity 1: reframing a problem / takeaways ::: You can reframe your questions using ideation with others to get better results! Also, idea boards are a great way to help introverts participate.
- ways of thinking
  - ways of thinking / blocks ::: There are ways of thinking that may get you stuck on a problem. They could be cultural/milieu, emotional, intellectual, or perceptual.
    - ways of thinking / blocks / cultural ::: embarrassment, fear of failure, uncomfortable with fantasy or intuition
    - ways of thinking / blocks / emotional ::: control is good and chaos is bad, no support for new ideas, not supposed to have fun
    - ways of thinking / blocks / intellectual ::: expert belief, inflexible style, wrong information
    - ways of thinking / blocks / perceptual ::: choosing too tight a view, difficulty isolating, stereotyping

## week 8 tutorial

- time: 2024-10-24T10:30:00+08:00/2024-10-24T12:20:00+08:00
- activity 1: how many uses ::: Think of as many uses for a paperclip in 3 minutes. Play intense music.
  - activity 1: how many uses / takeaways ::: Did you get stuck? If no, then good! Yes, it is normal. You can improve this by using different _schemas_, collaborating with others, and think in a more relaxed environment (No intense music!).
- activity 2: how many uses, better ::: Share with other people on your uses of a paperclip. Then, think of as many uses for a paperclip in 3 minutes again. Play relaxing music.
  - activity 2: how many uses, better / takeaways ::: Making use of different schemas, radical collaboration with others, and a relaxing environment helps with ideation and brainstorming. And most importantly, practice more!
- activity 3: Are you creative? ::: Draw a portrait of the person next to you quickly. Then share it with them. <p> Next, draw 4 things, each in 10 seconds: baby, door, house, and innovation. Finally, share, compare, and discuss with others.
- design thinking
  - design thinking / creativity ::: __Creativity__ in design thinking is the ability to show _unfinished_ work. It is also the ability to participate in something that _you might not be good at_.
  - design thinking / mindfulness of process ::: Being aware of where you are in the design thinking process is important, because it informs your approach. <p> Some example questions are: Are you _rushing to a solution_? Are you blocked? Are you energized by certain activities and drained by others?
  - design thinking / design for someone else ::: What does someone else need? You can _think differently_: "Need" is a verb (generates more opportunities), not a noun (immediate solution). Also, think of _insights_.
- activity 4: design a wallet for your partner ::: 3 people form a group. 2 people interview the other person and co-design a wallet for them. Repeat this 3 times for each person.
  - activity 4: design a wallet for your partner / takeaways ::: If you are the interviewee, you should walk people through your ideal wallet. <p> If you are the interviewer, take notes, listen to stories, and ask why 5 times (5 times is a guideline). <p> Finally, when brainstorming ideas, build on the ideas of others, defer judgement, encourage wild ideas, and go for volume!
- point of view statement ::: (user) needs a way to (verb) because (surprising insight).

## week 9 tutorial

- time: 2024-10-31T10:30:00+08:00/2024-10-31T12:20:00+08:00
- wild ideas
  - wild ideas / motivation ::: If you do not try to think of "wild ideas", often your ideas ends up "inside the box", respecting your assumptions. Thinking of "wild ideas" can help break your assumptions.
  - wild ideas / brainstorming ::: Frame a good question, ideally starting with "How might I...". Warm up your brain. Brainstorm many ideas using rules, ideally with other people. Select based on criteria. Extract insights (e.g. delightful idea, good idea).
- activity 1: decision making ::: Jot down a real decision you need to make and its associated emotions. Share it with others.
- decision making
  - decision making / elements ::: information, objectives, options
  - decision making / process (bad) ::: gather & create → narrow down → choose → _agonize_
  - decision making / process ::: gather & create → narrow down → choose → _let go & move on_ <p> Consequences of choices cannot influence choice itself. (Try to _really_ understand this seemingly-wrong sentence...)
  - decision making / gather & create ::: Try to gather more choices beyond the binary! <p> _Luck_ is about being open to more than just the task at hand. Anxiety disrupts people's ability to notice the unexpected. Those who call themselves lucky actively sought opportunities to meet new people and have new experiences. (Richard Wiseman, _The Luck Factor_)
  - decision making / narrow down ::: You need to narrow down your choices to avoid choice overload.
    - decision making / narrow down / matrix ::: Instead of listing the pros and cons of each choice, create a matrix. The column headers are the choices while the row headers are the objectives. Then assess each choice for each objective, ideally using emotional symbols (e.g. smiley face, neutral face, sad face). Use the matrix to remove the worst choices.
- design thinking
  - design thinking / discernment ::: __Discernment__ is integrating _multiple_ ways of knowing, which includes cognitive/intellectual, emotional/affective, physical/kinesthetic, and social.
    - design thinking / discernment / cognitive ::: decision matrix, pro–con list, logical reasoning
    - design thinking / discernment / emotional ::: feeling, intuition, spiritual knowing
    - design thinking / discernment / physical ::: physical message (e.g. feeling light, headache, stomachache, etc.)
    - design thinking / discernment / social ::: collective knowing/shared insight, trusted community, wisdom of mentors
    - design thinking / discernment / indicator ::: body sign, collective confirmation, epiphany (aha), insight, internal affect, recognition, simultaneity
    - design thinking / discernment / development ::: There are many ways to develop your ways of knowing. Some examples include exercise, letter from the future, meditation, music, reflection, journaling, yoga, etc.
- decision making
  - decision making / choose ::: When choosing, self-awareness is very important. Try to be aware of how others have influenced your choice and whether such influences are good. Examples of influence include: You are told that you should work in a certain occupation.
  - decision making / let go & move on ::: After making a choice, treat it as irreversible. Try to enter a "cycle of non-regret". <p> It turns out your brain will "synthesize" happiness for an irreversible choice, kinda like "wanting what you get", not "getting what you want". Keeping your choice open inhibits the above, and may make you worse since you will have lower happiness and poorer performance.
    - decision making / let go & move on / quotes ::: Quality of the decision does not equal quality of the outcome. (You cannot fully control the outcome for most things.) <p> Consequences of choices cannot influence choice itself. (Try to _really_ understand this seemingly-wrong sentence again...)
