- 15 A, 20 A :: common [fuse](fuse%20(electrical).md) or [circuit breaker](../../../../../general/circuit%20breaker.md) triggers <!--SR:!2024-02-11,4,284-->

- [electric arc](../../../../../general/electric%20arc.md) ::: Electric arcs can go through air to a person. They can also vaporize materials and produce extremely loud noises. These can cause non-contact burns. Emitted [infrared](../../../../../general/infrared.md) and [ultraviolet](../../../../../general/ultraviolete.md) radiation can cause eye damage. <!--SR:!2024-02-10,3,269!2024-02-11,4,289-->

- hazard control ::: live parts are either insulated or unreachable, earthing and protective earthing, grounding, protective bonding, [circuit breaker](../../../../../general/circult%20breaker.md), [center tap](../../../../../general/center%20tap.md), [double insulation](../../../../../general/appliance%20classes.md#Class%20II), compliance with cable standards, [intrinsic safety](../../../../../general/intrinsic%20safety.md), [personal protective equipment](../../../../../general/personal%20protective%20equipment.md) (PPE) <!--SR:!2024-02-08,1,249!2024-02-11,4,270-->
- [grounding](../../../../../general/ground%20(electricity).md) ::: Connect dead parts to the earth so that said dead part has zero potential during a fault. [EMSD](../../../../../general/Electrical%20and%20Mechanical%20Services%20Department.md): Z<sub>2</sub> <= 50 Z<sub>S</sub>/U<sub>O</sub> Ω, where Z<sub>S</sub> is the sum of live wire [impedance](../../../../../general/electrical%20impedance.md) Z<sub>1</sub>, ground wire [impedance](../../../../../general/electrical%20impedance.md) Z<sub>2</sub>, and ground [impedance](../../../../../general/electrical%20impedance.md) Z<sub>e</sub>, and U<sub>O</sub> is the source [voltage](../../../../../general/voltage.md), [diameter](../../../../../general/diameter.md) >= 12.5 mm <!--SR:!2024-02-10,3,264!2024-02-10,3,250-->
- protective bonding ::: Connect several conductive parts to ensure the parts have the same potential so that they do not conduct current during a fault. May be used with [grounding](../../../../../general/ground%20(electrical).md). <!--SR:!2024-02-10,3,264!2024-02-11,4,289-->
  - [circuit breaker](../../../../../general/circult%20breaker.md)
- [residual-current device](../../../../../general/residual-current%20device.md) (RCD) ::: Breaks a circuit when it detects leakage current to [ground](../../../../../general/ground%20(electricity).md). <!--SR:!2024-02-11,4,270!2024-02-11,4,270-->
- [miniature circuit breaker](../../../../../general/circuit%20breaker.md) (MCB) ::: A resettable [fuse](../../../../../general/fuse%20(electrical).md). Breaks a circuit when it detects overload. <!--SR:!2024-02-11,4,284!2024-02-11,4,270-->
- [residual-current device](../../../../../general/residual-current%20device.md) (RCBO) ::: A combination of RCD and MCB. <!--SR:!2024-02-11,4,270!2024-02-11,4,289-->
- [center tap](../../../../../general/center%20tap.md) ::: Used if one wants to provide two separate secondary voltage sources half of the original voltage. Make a contact halfway along a winding of a [transformer](../../../../../general/transformer.md) and ground it. Then the voltage of both wires in contact with the end of the winding is only half the potential difference of the entire winding. The voltages in the two wires are 180 degree out-of-phase of each other (or negative voltage in one of the wire). This can be used to provide extra-low voltage by reducing voltage from 220 V to 110 V, and then use a center tap to split it to two 55 V sources. <!--SR:!2024-02-10,3,264!2024-02-11,4,270-->
- [double insulation](../../../../../general/appliance%20classes.md#Class%20II) ::: Indicated by the double insulation symbol: ⧈ (a square inside another square). No single failure can cause dangerous voltage to be exposed as to cause [electric shock](../../../../../general/electrical%20injury.md) without the use of an earthed metal casing. Usually this is done by adding supplementary insulation on top of the basic insulation. Earthing is unnecessary in this case as any fault causes a fault current too low to trigger a [fuse](../../../../../general/fuse%20(electrical).md), because of the high-[impedance](../../../../../general/electrical%20impedance.md) casing. <!--SR:!2024-02-10,3,269!2024-02-08,1,249-->
- compliance with cable standards ::: [BS 1363](../../../../../general/BS%201363.md): Live (L) wire is brown, and on the right side of the plug when viewed from the plug cover.
