# HKUST ESST pressure safety outline

The content below is in teaching order.

- [pressure](../../../../../general/pressure.md) _P_ ::: [force](../../../../../general/force.md) applied perpendicular to a surface per unit area
  - [pressure](../../../../../general/pressure.md) [units of measurement](../../../../../general/unit%20of%20measurement.md) ::: [SI unit](../../../../../general/International%20System%20of%20Units.md): [pascal](../../../../../general/pascal%20(unit).md) (Pa), Pa = N/m<sup>2</sup>, 1 bar = 100000 Pa, 1 atm = 101325 Pa
- pressured system ::: One or more [pressure vessels](../../../../../general/pressure%20vessel.md), pipework, and associated protective devices. Classified into [boiler](../../../../../general/boiler.md) and [pressure vessel](../../../../../general/pressure%20vessel.md) in [Hong Kong](../../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md).
  - [boiler](../../../../../general/boiler.md) ::: electric heated boiler, electric steam boiler, fire-tube boiler, fossil fuel boiler, thermal oil heater, etc.
  - [pressure vessel](../../../../../general/pressure%20vessel.md) ::: air receiver, fixed vessel for starting internal combustion engine, spraying paint container, pressured fuel container, etc.
  - an example of a pressured system ::: Several boilers are connected to an air receiver. Each boiler has a control for controlling the flow to the air receiver. The air receiver can be used for many applications.
- hazards
  - hazard causes ::: blocked or restricted flow, compressor malfunction, external fire, failure of automatic controls, formation and ignition or detonation of carbonaceous deposits, ignition or detonation of oil or oil vapor, overheating
  - hazards ::: blast, chemical burn, explosion, fire, flying debris, poisoning, shockwave, suffocation, thermal burn
  - hazard control factors ::: control complexity, equipment age, equipment condition, equipment suitability, fluid type and properties, pressure, prevailing conditions, worker knowledge, worker skills
- design safety
  - design safety goals ::: examinable, has protective devices, protective devices that release contents do so safely, safely accessible interior, suitable material
  - design safety considerations ::: expected working life, fluid type and properties, operating limits, valve operating conditions
- technical requirements ::: Boilers and Pressure Vessels Regulations 2002 (Cap. 56A)
  - boiler requirements ::: marked with a distinguishing number, a spring-loaded safety valve and a separate stop-valve for controlling the maximum permissible working pressure (MPWP), a pressure gauge with red marking showing the MPWP, a fusible pressure release plug or efficient low-water alarm, a transparent water level gauge
  - air or steam receiver requirements ::: marked with a distinguishing number, a spring-loaded safety valve for controlling the maximum permissible working pressure (MPWP), a pressure gauge with red marking showing the MPWP, an automatic mechanism like reducing valve to prevent over-pressurizing, withstand the MPWP
  - pressurized fuel container requirements ::: maximum permissible working pressure (MPWP) not more than 500 kPa, a pressure release valve, a remote control valve as close to burner as possible, accessible valves and safety devices, all piping properly secured save for 0.6 m immediately before the burner
  - auxiliary equipment ::: flue damper, fuel pump, heater, multiple burner, pipe
- safety control measures ::: air inlet and outlet monitoring, calibrated pressure gauge, coolant protection, explosion protection, lubricant protection, safety valve, thermal protection
  - spring-loaded safety valve ::: Ensures the pressure is below the maximum permissible working pressure. Positioned downstream. Away from inlets to avoid disturbances.
  - calibrated pressure gauge ::: Has red marking indicating the the maximum permissible working pressure. Allows a test device to be fitted.
  - thermal protection ::: Shutdown requires action to be taken first to avoid overheating. Install fusible pressure release plug.
  - coolant protection ::: Shuts down compressors when the water temperature exceeds maximum.
  - lubricant protection ::: Shuts down compressors when the lubricant pressure drops below minimum.
  - air inlet and outlet monitoring ::: A water manometer or pressure-indicating device for each compressor air inlet.
- hydraulic system
  - hydraulic system hazards ::: burns, flailing or ruptured fittings or hoses, pinhole leak injury
  - hydraulic system safety measures ::: fix hose strap to restrain the failing motion of flexible hoses when dislocated, frequent examination for damages, high flashpoint hydraulic oil, pressurize in stages, proper construction, proper design, proper material, segregate and indicate work area
  - [combined gas law](../../../../../general/ideal%20gas%20law.md#combined%20gas%20law) ::: _PV_/_T_ = _k_: When volume decreases or temperature increases, pressure increases.
- compressed gas cylinder
  - compressed gas cylinder hazards ::: Pressure can reach over 100 bars. Leaking gas produce a force 20 to 50 times the cylinder weight, which is about 100 kg, similar to a rocket or guided missile. Over-pressurized vessel fail at a weak point if it exists. If that point is very weak, the vessel can fail at or below normal operating pressure.
  - compressed gas cylinder safety measures ::: close inactive valves, correct fittings and regulators, empty cylinders are marked empty, flashback arrestor when a flammable or oxidizing gas is used or otherwise the cylinder gas ignites, frequent inspection, keep upright, no electric arcs or heat sources nearby, no oily or greasy substances or otherwise explosion
- relevant legislation in [Hong Kong](../../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md) ::: Boilers and Pressure Vessels Ordinance (Cap. 56), Boilers and Pressure Vessels Regulations (Cap. 56A), Boilers and Pressure Vessels (Forms) Order (Cap. 56B), Dangerous Goods (General) Regulations (Repealed) (Cap. 295B)
  - Boilers and Pressure Vessels Ordinance (Cap. 56) ::: Provision of control and operation of boilers and pressure vessels. Ensure standards. Define "appointed examiners" and "competent person". Require Certificate of Fitness and Certificate of Examination.
  - Certificate of Fitness ::: Required for boiler pressure vessel, steam container, and auxiliary equipment ,but NOT pressurized fuel container, to be used. Valid for 26 months. Must renew after repair, prohibition order, hired, or sold. The examination process is outlined under hydraulic test.
  - hydraulic test ::: For seamless steel air receivers, test pressure is given by $\begin{cases} \mathrm{MPWP} + 1.4 \times 10^7 \mathrm{\ Pa} & \text{ if } 1.4 \times 10^7 \mathrm{\ Pa} < \mathrm{MPWP} \le 2.8 \times 10^7 \mathrm{\ Pa} \\ 1.5 \,\mathrm{MPWP} & \text{ if } \mathrm{MPWP} > 2.8 \times 10^7 \mathrm{\ Pa} \end{cases}$. For other air receivers, $\begin{cases} 2 \,\mathrm{MPWP} & \text{ if } \mathrm{MPWP} \le 7 \times 10^5 \mathrm{\ Pa} \\ 1.5 \,\mathrm{MPWP} + 3.5 \times 10^5 \mathrm{\ Pa} & \text{ if } \mathrm{MPWP} > 7 \times 10^5 \mathrm{\ Pa} \end{cases}$.
  - Dangerous Goods (General) Regulations (Repealed) (Cap. 295B) ::: Governs pressurized cylinders.
  - pressurized cylinder ::: Governed by Dangerous Goods (General) Regulations (Repealed) (Cap. 295B) instead. Requires hydraulic stretch test and hydraulic pressure test. Valid for 5 years.
  - hydraulic stretch test and hydraulic pressure test ::: For permanent gas, the pressure for hydraulic stretch test is not less than 21 MPa and for hydraulic pressure test is n ot less than 20 MPa. For liquefied gas, the pressure is not less than 4/3 of the working pressure. The cylinder shall be destroyed if it shows a permanent volumetric expansion of more than 10%, leakage, or deformation under the tests.
