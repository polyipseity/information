# HKUST ESST occupational health outline

The content below is in teaching order.

- occupational health ::: general community environment, occupational hygiene, occupational medicine, occupational rehabilitation, workers, workplace
- occupational health services in [Hong Kong](../../../../../general/Hong%20Kong.md) ::: Under Labour Department, there is an occupational hygiene section and an occupational medicine section.
  - occupational hygiene section ::: industrial hygienists anticipate, recognize, evaluate, and control workplace hazards
  - occupational medicine section ::: conduct medical clearance, diagnosis, education, promotion, treatment
- occupational hazard types ::: biological, chemical, ergonomics, occupation-specific, physical, socio-psychological
- occupational hazard factors ::: control, environment, equipment, material, process, user
- chemical hazards ::: gases or vapors, dusts or particulates
  - gases or vapor hazards ::: benzene; epoxy; hydrogen sulphide, a common sewer gas; polyurethane
  - dusts or particulates hazards ::: asbestos, mesothelioma; cement, cement contact dermatitis; silica, silicosis
- physical hazards ::: ionizing radiation, noise, nonionizing radiation, pressure, temperature, vibration
  - ultraviolet radiation ::: in decreasing wavelength (and hence increasing energy): UV-A: 315~400 nm, UV-B: 280~315 nm, UV-C: 100~280 nm; from fluorescent tubes, sun, ultraviolet lamps, welding arcs
    - UV-A and UV-B health effects ::: skin: aging, cancer, erythema, photosensitization
    - UV-C health effects ::: eyes: conjunctivitis, photokeratitis due to welder's flash
    - ultraviolet radiation effect on airborne chemicals ::: chlorinated hydrocarbons to phosgene, oxygen to ozone
  - noise ::: unwanted sound
    - human audible frequency range ::: 20~20000 Hz
    - noise health effects ::: communication interference, noise induced hearing loss, psychological effects
    - noise health effect factors ::: employment length, exposure time, frequency distribution, level
    - noise types ::: continuous, impact, intermittent
  - temperature hazards ::: Too hot or too cold. Usually too hot for most industries. Present in cold storages, glassworks, kitchens, laundries, steelworks, for example.
    - heat disorders ::: heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat rash, heat stroke
      - heat rash ::: red spots on skin
      - heat exhaustion ::: fainting, headache, nausea, tiredness due to water loss
      - heat cramps ::: muscle cramps, often painful, due to electrolyte loss and core temperature increase
      - heat stroke ::: most serious, can be fatal; convulsions, dry hot skin, elevated core temperature, high temperature, mental confusion, reduced sweating
- biological hazards ::: animal handlers/food processors, _Streptococcus suis_ infection; healthcare/lab, tuberculosis; ventilation maintenance, [Legionnaires' Disease](../../../../../general/Legionnaires'%20Disease.md)
  - [Legionnaires' Disease](../../../../../general/Legionnaires'%20Disease.md) ::: Usually caused by _Legionella pneumophila_. Transmitted by inhalation of aerosols. Symptoms include pneumonia. Symptoms include breathlessness, cough, fever, headache, malaise, muscle ache, and pneumonia. Related occupations include maintenance of systems using water. A notifiable occupational disease under Compensation Ordinance.
- ergonomics ::: maximize comfort zone, minimize injurious forces
  - ergonomic injuries ::: mechanical stresses or stretches, occupational cumulative trauma disorders
    - occupational cumulative trauma disorders ::: carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis, tenosynovitis
- socio-psychological hazards ::: occupational stress, workplace violence
- particulate sizes ::: according to [American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists], inhalable dusts: ≤ 100 µm, thoraic dusts: ≤ 10 µm, respirable dusts: ≤ 4 µm
- toxicity equation ::: toxicity × quantity × time
- occupational exposure limits ::: ceiling, short term exposure limit, time weighted average
  - occupational exposure limit - ceiling ::: at any time
  - occupational exposure limit - short term exposure limit ::: 15-minute average, 60-minute exposure 4 times daily
  - occupational exposure limit - time weighted average ::: 8-hour average, repeated daily exposure
- exposure measurement methods ::: direct reading, air or surface sampling and laboratory analysis
  - direct reading ::: colorimetry like color detection tubes, electronic instruments
  - air or surface and laboratory analysis ::: active sampling and passive sampling like badges
- hazard control hierarchy ::: in decreasing preference: hazard reduction or elimination, engineering, administration, personal protective equipment
  - personal protective equipment
    - personal protective equipment disadvantages ::: administrative burden, expensive, physiological burden
      - eye and face protection ::: face shields, safety glasses, safety goggles
        - safety goggle characteristics ::: chemical splash proof, direct vent, impact resistant, indirect vent
      - breathing protection ::: air-purifying respirators
        - air-purifying respirator characteristics ::: full-face, half-face, negative pressure
        - respirator fit tests ::: qualitative fit test and quantitative fit test
      - skin protection against corrosives and solvents ::: chemical gloves, can be made from butyl, latex, nitrile, polyvinyl chloride, etc.
        - chemical gloves precaution ::: test for leaks or pinholes, use the correct type for different chemicals
- occupational health goals ::: protect the environment, general community, and workers' health
