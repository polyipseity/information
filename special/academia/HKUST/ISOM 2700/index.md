  - business process / customers' view ::@:: Let's say you are a patient in a hospital. You need to go through a set of processes: registration, preparation, procedure, recovery, and discharge. You can use a _Gantt chart_ to visualize the duration of your activities. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,12,298!2025-03-06,18,318-->
- [Gantt chart](../../../../general/Gantt%20chart.md) ::@:: It is a bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. It can show the sequence, duration, and dependence of activities. <!--SR:!2025-03-04,17,318!2025-03-05,18,318-->
- [business process](../../../../general/business%20process.md)
  - business process / managers' view ::@:: Let's say you are a manager in a hospital. There are too many patients, so you cannot create a Gantt chart for every patient. Instead, view the activities as a _process_ for each patient to pass through, i.e. _business process modeling_. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,11,298!2025-03-05,18,318-->

  - business process modeling / benefits ::@:: Allows you to build a holistic/macro view of a process without delving into the (often unnecessary) details of each customer. This is using _modeling_ and _abstraction_ of OM. Then you can identify _key challenges_ and _improve_ on them. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,11,298!2025-03-05,18,318-->
  - business process modeling / limitation ::@:: You lose granular information on each customer. But this is often fine for the purpose of improving processes. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,18,318!2025-03-05,18,318-->
  - business process modeling / network model ::@:: It is a network of _activities_ (e.g. activity, _buffer_) performed by _resources_ (e.g. capital, labor, material) that transforms _inputs_ (e.g. materials, customers) into _outputs_ (e.g. goods, services). There can be more than one input. There can also be more than one output. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,11,298!2025-02-27,12,294-->
  - business process modeling / flow unit ::@:: It is what is tracked through a process, and defines the _outputs_ (not _inputs_) of interest. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,18,318!2025-03-05,18,318-->

  - Gantt chart / bottlenecks ::@:: An activity that keeps processing units. Other activities may finish faster, so the other activities may wait for new units due to the aforementioned activity being unfinished. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,18,318!2025-03-05,18,318-->

- cumulative inflow/outflow chart ::@:: A cumulative chart with two lines, with the _x_-axis being time and _y_-axis being the number of units. One line is the _cumulative inflow_, which increases by 1 every time a flow unit enters the process. The other line is the _cumulative outflow_, which increases by 1 every time a flow unit exits the process. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,18,318!2025-02-27,11,298-->
  - cumulative inflow/outflow chart / _x_-gap ::@:: The _x_-gap at a particular _y_ is the flow time for the _y_-th unit. The average _x_-gap is the average flow time. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,18,318!2025-03-06,18,318-->
  - cumulative inflow/outflow chart / _y_-gap ::@:: The _y_-gap at a particular _x_ is the WIP inventory at time _x_. The average _y_-gap is the average WIP inventory. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,18,318!2025-03-04,17,318-->
  - cumulative inflow/outflow chart / slope ::@:: The average slope of the cumulative inflow is the input flow rate. The average slope of the cumulative output flow rate. <p> These two average slopes should be the same for a _stable process_. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,11,298!2025-03-06,18,318-->
  - cumulative inflow/outflow chart / relation ::@:: y-gap = x-gap × slope; this is also known as Little's law <!--SR:!2025-03-06,18,318!2025-03-05,18,318-->
- [Little's law](../../../../general/Little's%20law.md) ::@:: It is a theorem by John Little which states that the long-term average number _L_ (_I_: average inventory) of customers in a stationary system is equal to the long-term average effective arrival rate _λ_ (_R_: average flow rate) multiplied by the average time _W_ (_T_: average flow time) that a customer spends in the system. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,18,318!2025-03-06,18,318-->
  - Little's law / equation ::@:: _I_ = _R_ × _T_, where _I_ is average inventory, _R_ is average flow rate, and _T_ is average flow time <!--SR:!2025-03-04,17,318!2025-02-26,11,298-->
  - Little's law / subprocess ::@:: It can be applied to the whole process or part of the process. When doing the latter, use the corresponding _I_, _R_, and _T_ for the part of the process. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,18,318!2025-03-06,18,318-->
  - Little's law / conditions ::@:: It holds for _all stable processes_, regardless of complexity (e.g. multiple flow units), sequence (e.g. FIFO, LIFO), and randomness (e.g. arrival time, flow time). <p> A _stable process_ is a process where the average rate of input equals the average rate of output, so inventory does not accumulate to infinity as time passes by. <!--SR:!2025-02-26,11,298!2025-02-27,11,298-->
  - Little's law / implications ::@:: Given the conditions are satisfied, one is that we can find one variable from the other two variables in the set of variables _I_, _R_, and _T_. It also means there are trade-offs when setting management goals. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,18,318!2025-03-04,17,318-->
  - Little's law / example ::@:: customers in supermarkets: The amount of time spent by a customer in a supermarket is important to the management. We can use Little's law to find the average time customers spend in the store. <!--SR:!2025-03-04,17,315!2025-03-05,18,318-->
