- topic: Introduction to OM
- about the instructor
- course logistics
- [operations management](../../../../general/operations%20management.md) ::@:: to manage how a firm creates its products and/or services
  - operations management / examples ::@:: Intel: CPU, HSKH Medical: healthcare services, Ernst & Young: accounting services, HSBC: financial services, HKUST: education service
  - operations management / transformation ::@:: design, analyze, and improve the _transformation_ of _inputs_ to _outputs_, to deliver the firm's _products and services_ ("physics" of the business world)
    - operations management / transformation / elements ::@:: capital (finance), labor (management), raw resources (purchasing), technology (engineering), transformed by operations, to final products (marketing)
  - operations management / features ::@:: generality and broadness, modeling and abstraction, quantitative analysis, practical relevance
  - operations management / generality and broadness ::@:: apply to many business settings
    - operations management / generality and broadness / examples ::@:: Little's Law: flow time, flow rate, inventory level; Newsvendor model: production and ordering level under uncertainty
  - operations management / modeling and abstraction ::@:: captures the key decision-making step and trade-off from a complex setting, and then apply the results back; simplifications are needed, which is convenient but can also bring limitation
  - operations management / quantitative analysis ::@:: mathematical tools are needed; relatively easy now, difficult later; but understanding the problem/picture is more important
  - operations management / practical relevance ::@:: focuses on real-world business problems and usually has substantial implications on humans; good business acumen are needed: key trade-offs, managerial insights
    - operations management / practical relevance / examples ::@:: allocation of ICU beds during the pandemic; fairness, equity, social responsibility, not just profit maximization
  - operations management / steps ::@:: description, optimization
  - operations management / description ::@:: estimate and understand the dynamics and performance of the system (like physics), e.g. expected waiting time, average inventory level, expected revenue
  - operations management / optimization ::@:: identify the ways to improve the system performance (like engineering), e.g. how to order, how to allocate
  - operations management / decisions
    - operations management / decisions / examples ::@:: capacity, demand, inventory, pricing, supply chain
  - operations management / concepts
    - operations management / concepts / examples ::@:: manufacturing strategy, just-in-time (JIT) production, business process re-engineering, business analytics, sustainability
  - operations management / current topics ::@:: balancing profitability and sustainability, coordination in complex global supply network, customer touchpoints with technology, enhancing performance using data
  - operations management / reasons for studying ::@:: career development, rich opportunities, understanding real world firm decisions
    - operations management / reasons for studying / understanding real world firm decisions ::@:: Look inside the box. For example, there are many processes before putting products onto a storefront, such as customer services (management), distribution centers (inventory), suppliers (supply chain), plants (capacity)
    - operations management / reasons for studying / rich opportunities ::@:: management consulting, supply-chain management, synergy with other areas (e.g. accounting, finance, marketing, technology)
    - operations management / reasons for studying / career development ::@:: case interview, future study, stock-pitching/investment competitions
  - operations management / learning methods ::@:: business magazines and news media, lectures, spreadsheet analysis, real world examples; understand concepts using examples, then solve problems, then gain managerial insights
