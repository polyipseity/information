  - Gantt chart / bottlenecks ::@:: An activity that keeps processing units. Other activities may finish faster, so the other activities may wait for new units due to the aforementioned activity being unfinished. <!--SR:!2025-05-24,80,338!2025-05-26,82,338-->
  - Gantt chart / finding flow time ::@:: Find the duration a color stays in the diagram.  Or (assuming the system is stable) given a process diagram, add up the duration of tasks a unit needs to go through. <!--SR:!2025-05-22,77,338!2025-05-24,80,338-->

- cumulative inflow/outflow chart ::@:: A cumulative chart with two lines, with the _x_-axis being time and _y_-axis being the number of units. One line is the _cumulative inflow_, which increases by 1 every time a flow unit enters the process. The other line is the _cumulative outflow_, which increases by 1 every time a flow unit exits the process. <!--SR:!2025-05-26,81,338!2025-04-13,45,318-->
  - cumulative inflow/outflow chart / _x_-gap ::@:: The _x_-gap at a particular _y_ is the flow time for the _y_-th unit. The average _x_-gap is the average flow time. <!--SR:!2025-05-25,81,338!2025-05-27,82,338-->
  - cumulative inflow/outflow chart / _y_-gap ::@:: The _y_-gap at a particular _x_ is the WIP inventory at time _x_. The average _y_-gap is the average WIP inventory. <!--SR:!2025-05-23,78,338!2025-05-22,78,338-->
  - cumulative inflow/outflow chart / slope ::@:: The average slope of the cumulative inflow is the input flow rate. The average slope of the cumulative output flow rate. <p> These two average slopes should be the same for a _stable process_. <!--SR:!2025-04-11,43,318!2025-05-24,79,338-->
  - cumulative inflow/outflow chart / relation ::@:: y-gap = x-gap × slope; this is also known as Little's law <!--SR:!2025-05-27,82,338!2025-05-25,81,338-->
- [Little's law](../../../../general/Little's%20law.md) ::@:: It is a theorem by John Little which states that the long-term average number _L_ (_I_: average inventory) of customers in a stationary system is equal to the long-term average effective arrival rate _λ_ (_R_: average flow rate) multiplied by the average time _W_ (_T_: average flow time) that a customer spends in the system. <!--SR:!2025-05-26,82,338!2025-05-04,59,318-->
  - Little's law / equation ::@:: _I_ = _R_ × _T_, where _I_ is average inventory, _R_ is average flow rate, and _T_ is average flow time <!--SR:!2025-05-22,78,338!2025-04-14,47,318-->
  - Little's law / subprocess ::@:: It can be applied to the whole process or part of the process. When doing the latter, use the corresponding _I_, _R_, and _T_ for the part of the process. <!--SR:!2025-05-26,82,338!2025-05-21,76,338-->
  - Little's law / conditions ::@:: It holds for _all stable processes_, regardless of complexity (e.g. multiple flow units), sequence (e.g. FIFO, LIFO), and randomness (e.g. arrival time, flow time). <p> A _stable process_ is a process where the average rate of input equals the average rate of output, so inventory does not accumulate to infinity as time passes by. <!--SR:!2025-04-12,45,318!2025-04-13,45,318-->
  - Little's law / implications ::@:: Given the conditions are satisfied, one is that we can find one variable from the other two variables in the set of variables _I_, _R_, and _T_. It also means there are trade-offs when setting management goals. <!--SR:!2025-05-26,81,338!2025-05-22,78,338-->
  - Little's law / example ::@:: customers in supermarkets: The amount of time spent by a customer in a supermarket is important to the management. We can use Little's law to find the average time customers spend in the store. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,77,335!2025-05-23,79,338-->

## week 2 lecture

- datetime: 2025-02-10T10:30:00+08:00/2025-02-10T11:50:00+08:00
- topic: bottleneck analysis, throughput analysis
- [bottleneck](../../../../general/bottleneck%20(production).md) ::@:: a process in a chain of processes, such that its limited capacity reduces the capacity of the whole chain <!--SR:!2025-06-14,92,361!2025-06-14,92,361-->
  - bottleneck / motivation ::@:: _Process capacity_ is the _maximum_ flow rate. _Bottlenecks_ determine the process capacity. This is useful for improving process capacity, since bottlenecks determine the process capacity, we should prioritize improving the bottleneck. <!--SR:!2025-06-06,85,361!2025-06-08,87,361-->
- [law of the minimum](../../../../general/Liebig's%20law%20of%20the%20minimum.md) ::@:: For a process to produce a unit, every resource must finish its own job. Thus, the process capacity is determined by the slowest resource. <!--SR:!2025-06-07,86,361!2025-06-08,87,361-->
  - law of the minimum / examples ::@:: The capacity of a barrel with staves of unequal length is limited by the shortest stave. <p> A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. <p> The flow rate of an irregular pipe is limited by its narrowest gap. <!--SR:!2025-06-07,86,361!2025-06-12,90,361-->
- [bottleneck](../../../../general/bottleneck%20(production).md)
  - bottleneck / identification ::@:: List activities, resources (workers to perform activities), and processing times. Assign resources to activities (the assignment can be very complex). For each resource (not activity), compute its workload needed to produce a unit and thus its _capacity_. Finally, identify the _bottleneck resource_, which is the resource with the _lowest_ capacity. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,31,301!2025-06-04,83,361-->
    - bottleneck / identification / scenarios ::@:: In general, multiple resources can be assigned to multiple tasks, with AND/OR connecting the resources. <p> For this course, we consider 3 simple scenarios: one-to-one (each resource is required by exactly one activity), and (one resource is needed in multiple activities), and or (one activity can be performed by multiple resources). <!--SR:!2025-06-05,84,361!2025-06-04,83,361-->
    - bottleneck / identification / one-to-one ::@:: Simple. Simply find the resource with the _lowest_ capacity. <!--SR:!2025-06-11,89,361!2025-06-05,84,361-->
    - bottleneck / identification / and ::@:: Determine activities by each resources that is required to produce a unit. Find the time required per unit, and thus its capacity. Then find the resource with the _lowest_ capacity. <!--SR:!2025-05-15,63,341!2025-06-08,87,361-->
    - bottleneck / identification / or ::@:: Pool multiple resources that can perform the same process into one, effectively treating the resource as one. Its capacity is the sum of the capacities of the multiple resources. Then find the resource with the _lowest_ capacity. <!--SR:!2025-06-14,92,361!2025-06-11,89,361-->
    - bottleneck / identification / random process ::@:: Sometimes, only a percentage (not all) units flow from a process (process A) to another process (process B). In this case, we should find process B's _effective_ capacity from its actual capacity. It can be obtained by dividing its actual capacity by the percentage of units that flow from process A to process B. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,68,341!2025-05-21,68,341-->
- [production leveling](../../../../general/production%20leveling.md) (line balancing) ::@:: By moving capacity to bottlenecks or moving workload to underutilized resources, we can balance the workload among resources in the process. This helps raise the capacity of bottlenecks and reduces _supply—demand mismatch_ within the process. <!--SR:!2025-04-30,55,341!2025-06-14,92,361-->
  - production leveling / examples ::@:: flexible line layouts: Operators can move nearby instead of being stuck to a fixed location to self-balance the workload. It also makes it easier to add or remove operators. <br/> U-shaped lines: Operators do not need to move as much to reach a process that is further away. Less operators are also needed as operators can work on multiple processes that are far away from each other. <!--SR:!2025-06-06,85,361!2025-05-07,60,341-->
- [capacity utilization](../../../../general/capacity%20utilization.md) ::@:: flow rate / resource capacity <p> It measures how much of the resource capacity is being used. <!--SR:!2025-06-05,84,361!2025-06-14,92,361-->
- [bottleneck](../../../../general/bottleneck%20(production).md)
  - bottleneck / utilization ::@:: Given the flow rate is the same for all resources (which may _not_ be the case if the process is random), if a resource has lower capacity, it has higher utilization. So the bottleneck can also be stated as the resource with _highest utilization_. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,68,341!2025-05-05,58,341-->
- [capacity utilization](../../../../general/capacity%20utilization.md)
  - capacity utilization / utilization profile chart ::@:: Plot a bar chart of each resource and its utilization (in percentage). <!--SR:!2025-04-29,53,341!2025-06-13,91,361-->
    - capacity utilization / utilization profile chart / interpretation ::@:: Given the flow rate is the same for all resources (which may _not_ be the case if the process is random), the resource with the highest utilization is the _bottleneck_. The gap between the highest utilization and the lowest utilization is the _imbalance_ relative to the bottleneck. The gap between 100% and the highest utilization is the _mismatch between supply and demand_ (explained below). <!--SR:!2025-06-13,91,361!2025-04-14,38,321-->
- flow rate
  - flow rate / input, process capacity, potential demand ::@:: It is the minimum between input, process capacity, and potential demand. <!--SR:!2025-06-06,85,361!2025-06-04,83,361-->
  - flow rate / input-constrained ::@:: Input is fully used. Process capacity is not fully used. Potential demand is not fully satisfied. <!--SR:!2025-06-06,85,361!2025-06-14,92,361-->
  - flow rate / demand-constrained ::@:: Input is not fully used. Process capacity is not fully used. Potential demand is fully satisfied. <!--SR:!2025-06-14,92,361!2025-06-14,92,361-->

  - capacity utilization / process utilization ::@:: It is defined as the _bottleneck_ utilization. <!--SR:!2025-06-10,88,361!2025-06-12,90,361-->
    - capacity utilization / process utilization / lower than 100% ::@:: Given the flow rate is the same for all resources (which may _not_ be the case if the process is random), this means the process is _not_ capacity-constrained, but either input-constrained or demand-constrained (or both). <!--SR:!2025-06-04,83,361!2025-06-08,87,361-->

  - capacity utilization / complex processes ::@:: If the process have multiple flow units or is complex with different paths, e.g. patients of different severity, then we calculate the _implied utilization_ for each resource. The _bottleneck_ is the resource with the highest _implied utilization_ (this is true even for complex processes). <!--SR:!2025-04-14,38,321!2025-06-14,92,361-->

- datetime: 2025-02-12T10:30:00+08:00/2025-02-12T11:50:00+08:00
- topic: OM and finance, inventory turnover analysis, ROIC tree, basic statistics concepts
- [operations management](../../../../general/operations%20management.md)
  - operations management / accounting & finance ::@:: It plays an important role in understanding and improving a firm's financial performance. <p> Examples are inventory costs, inventory turnover, and return on invested capital (ROIC). <!--SR:!2025-05-15,65,346!2025-05-07,58,346-->
- [inventory](../../../../general/inventory.md) ::@:: It refers to the goods and materials that a business holds for the ultimate goal of resale, production or utilization. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,19,346!2025-04-15,40,326-->
  - inventory / importance ::@:: They are everywhere. So it is an important signal for managers and analysts to determine how well a retailer is running its business. <p> An empirical analysis for over 353 publicly listed U.S. retailers for the period 1985–2003 inventory shows: 57% publicly traded retailers has inventory as the largest asset on the balance sheet. On average, the inventory takes up 35.1% of total assets. <!--SR:!2025-04-11,36,306!2025-04-15,40,326-->
  - inventory / benefits ::@:: economics of scale (i.e. produce more than the _current_ demand), meet variation in demand or processes (e.g. unexpected shocks), independence between operations (the inventory act as a buffer) <!--SR:!2025-04-29,52,346!2025-04-29,52,346-->
  - inventory / costs ::@:: carrying/holding costs, overhead costs (e.g. ordering, production change, setup), shortage costs (due to lost sales) <!--SR:!2025-04-16,38,326!2025-04-16,38,326-->
  - inventory / inventory turnover ::@:: $$\frac 1 {\text{flow time} } = \frac {\text{\# units sold in a period (flow rate)} } {\text{\# units in inventory (inventory)} } = \frac {\text{COGS in a period} } {\text{average inventory at cost} }$$ <p> The first equality is by Little's law. The second equality is by multiplying average purchase cost on both top and bottom, since we generally do not know the numbers of units in inventory and sold in financial statements. <!--SR:!2025-04-28,48,326!2025-04-15,40,326-->
    - inventory / inventory turnover / sources ::@:: _Flow time_ is how long a unit spends in the inventory before being sold. COGS in a period and _average_ inventory at (purchasing) cost can be obtained from financial statements. <!--SR:!2025-04-03,29,306!2025-04-30,52,346-->
  - inventory / weeks of supply ::@:: This is basically how long the _average_ inventory at cost can last (assuming no new purchases), in number of weeks. <p> To calculate it, it is the _reciprocal_ of inventory turnover multiplied by _52_ weeks. It is also the flow time (which is in years) multiplied by _52_ weeks. <!--SR:!2025-04-27,47,326!2025-05-07,58,346-->
  - inventory / per unit inventory holding cost ::@:: It measures the holding cost per unit relative to the unit's purchase cost. <p> To calculate it, divide annual inventory holding cost (in % of average inventory) by annual inventory turnover. <p> The key insight is that each inventory turnover "refreshes" the average inventory. <!--SR:!2025-05-07,58,346!2025-04-03,29,306-->
  - inventory / inventory turnover
    - inventory / inventory turnover / interpretation ::@:: It can evaluate a firm's performance by comparing it with firms in the _same_ sector, since it can vary drastically across sectors (e.g. from 6.70 in consumer sector to 48.76 in finance sector). <!--SR:!2025-04-30,52,346!2025-03-16,19,346-->
- [return on invested capital](../../../../general/return%20on%20capital.md) (ROIC) ::@:: It is a ratio used in finance, valuation and accounting, as a measure of the profitability and value-creating potential of companies relative to the amount of capital invested by shareholders and other debtholders. <p> It is calculated as: return (NOPAT) / average invested capital, where NOPAT is net operating income after tax <!--SR:!2025-05-09,60,346!2025-05-13,63,346-->
  - return on invested capital / economic value created ::@:: economic value created = capital \* (ROIC - WACC), where WACC is the weighted average cost of capital <!--SR:!2025-03-16,19,346!2025-03-16,19,346-->
  - return on invested capital / OM ::@:: We can either calculate NOPAT (which may be easier sometimes...), or use the DuPont model to see how ROIC is related to OM measures, e.g. flow rate. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,19,346!2025-03-16,19,346-->
  - return on invested capital / [DuPont analysis](../../../../general/DuPont%20analysis.md) ::@:: ROIC = return (NOPAT) / average invested capital = (return / revenue) \* (revenue / invested capital) = margin \* asset turnover <!--SR:!2025-04-27,47,326!2025-04-07,32,306-->
    - return on invested capital / DuPoint analysis / OM ::@:: margin = 1 − fixed costs / (_flow rate_ \* price) − variable costs / price <br/> asset turnover = _flow rate_ \* price / invested capital <!--SR:!2025-04-07,32,306!2025-04-06,32,306-->
      - return on invested capital / DuPoint analysis / OM / margin ::@:: Increasing flow rate increases margin by dividing the fixed costs by a larger denominator. This means the fixed costs are spread throughout more units. (Imagine infinite flow rate: fixed cost would be negligible compared to variable cost.) <!--SR:!2025-05-09,60,346!2025-05-06,59,346-->
      - return on invested capital / DuPoint analysis / OM / asset turnover ::@:: Increasing flow rate increases asset turnover by increasing revenue by simply selling more units in a period for the same amount of invested capital. <!--SR:!2025-04-15,40,326!2025-04-29,52,346-->
  - return on invested capital / what-if analysis ::@:: Using DuPoint analysis, we can quickly figure out how increase in flow rate increases ROIC. <p> To calculate them, calculate the old and new ROIC. You can then calculate the (percentage) increase in ROIC. You can also calculate the increase in return by multiplying the ROIC difference with the invested capital (assuming the invested capital remains the same). <!--SR:!2025-04-30,52,346!2025-04-29,52,346-->
- [random variable](../../../../general/random%20variable.md) (r.v.) ::@:: A __random variable__ (__r.v.__) is a mathematical function. Its _domain_ is the sample space. Its _range_ is a measurable space, usually a finite set of integers or the real numbers. The function need not be _injective_ (different samples need not map to different values). It is commonly denoted by capital letters, with its possible numerical values (also called __realizations__) by the same but lowercase letters. <p> A way to think about random variable is that it maps each outcome to a real number. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,19,346!2025-05-16,66,346-->
  - random variable / for business ::@:: Many random variables in practice can be described by mean and variance (square of standard deviation). The exact distribution can be specified using a cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F(Q)$ or probability density function (PDF) $f(q)$ (actually for discrete values, it should be probability mass function (PMF)). <!--SR:!2025-05-08,59,346!2025-03-16,19,346-->
  - random variable / motivation ::@:: Demand for a product or service is usually random. Demand forecasting is important in OM (learn later/below), and is done by obtaining demand distribution from historical or survey data. <p> But before we do that, how do we describe demand more mathematically? Random variables can do so. <!--SR:!2025-05-01,53,346!2025-04-29,52,346-->
- [cumulative distribution function](../../../../general/cumulative%20distribution%20function.md) (CDF, cdf) ::@:: A __cumulative distribution function__ (__CDF__, __cdf__) of a real-valued random variable _X_ is the probability that _X_ will take a value less than or equal to _x_. It is given by: $$F_X(x) = P(X \le x) \,.$$ The probability that _X_ will take a value in between \(_a_, _b_\], where _a_ < _b_, is $$P(a < X \le b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-05-15,65,346!2025-03-16,19,346-->
- [probability density function](../../../../general/probability%20density%20function.md) (PDF, pdf) ::@:: The __probability density function__ (__PDF__, __pdf__) of an _absolutely continuous_ random variable is a function whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a _relative likelihood_ that the value of the random variable would be equal to that sample. <p> Probability density is the probability per unit length, in other words, the _absolute likelihood_ for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 since there is an infinite set of possible values to begin with. <p> It is commonly denoted $f_X(x)$ for an absolutely continuous random variable _X_. <!--SR:!2025-05-01,53,346!2025-03-16,19,346-->
- [probability mass function](../../../../general/probability%20mass%20function.md) (PMF, pmf) ::@:: A __probability mass function__ (__PMF__, __pmf__) is a function that gives the probability that a _discrete random variable_ is exactly equal to some value. It is given by: $$p_X(x) = P(X = x) \,.$$ It is not defined for a continuous random variable. <p> The PMF has the following properties: $$\begin{aligned} \sum_x p_X(x) & = 1 \\ p_X(x) & \ge 0 \,. \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-04-30,52,346!2025-05-07,58,346-->
- [expected value](../../../../general/expected%20value.md) ::@:: The __expected value__ (__population mean__, __first moment__) is a generalization of the weighted average. Informally, the expected value is the mean of the possible values a random variable can take, weighted by the probability of those outcomes. It is commonly denoted $E(X)$. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,19,346!2025-03-16,19,346-->
  - expected value / discrete random variable ::@:: The expected value of a discrete random variable is the weighted average of all possible outcomes $\mathcal X$: $$\operatorname E[X] = \sum_{x \in \mathcal X} x p(x) \,.$$ <p> (optional, uncovered) This is only defined if the sum converges absolutely, so it is possible for a discrete random variable to have a undefined expected value. <p> Also, $$\operatorname E[g(X)] = \sum_{x \in \mathcal X} g(x) p(x) \,.$$ for an arbitrary function $g(x)$. <!--SR:!2025-05-08,59,346!2025-03-16,19,346-->
  - expected value / continuous random variable (optional) ::@:: The expected value of a continuous random variable is the weighted average of all possible outcomes $\mathcal X$: $$\operatorname E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \! x f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x \,\mathrm{d}F(x) \,.$$ <p> (uncovered) This is only defined if the integral converges absolutely, so it is possible for a continuous random variable to have a undefined expected value. <p> Also, $$\operatorname E[g(X)] = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \! g(x) f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} g(x) \,\mathrm{d}F(x) \,.$$ for an arbitrary function $g(x)$. <!--SR:!2025-04-29,52,346!2025-05-14,64,346-->
- [coefficient of variation](../../../../general/coefficient%20of%20variation.md) ::@:: It is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation (_not_ variance) $\sigma$ to the mean $\mu$, $CV={\frac {\sigma }{\mu } }$. <p> It shows the extent of variability in relation to the mean of the population. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,19,346!2025-03-15,19,346-->
  - coefficient of variation / OM ::@:: Widely used in OM to measure the degree of variation for different objectives. It shows the core OM idea of _standardization_. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,19,346!2025-03-15,19,346-->
- [sample mean](sample%20mean%20and%20covariance.md)
  - sample mean / equation ::@:: Given _N_ samples of a random variable _X_, its _sample mean_ is: $$\overline X = \frac 1 N \sum_{k = 1}^N X_k \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-03-16,17,355!2025-03-18,19,355-->
  - sample mean / properties ::@:: It is _unbiased_: $\operatorname E[\overline X] = \mu_X$. It has a variance that is inversely proportional to the number of samples: $\operatorname{Var}(\overline X) = \frac {\sigma_X^2} N$ (hence $\operatorname{Sd}(\overline X) = \frac {\sigma_X} {\sqrt N}$). <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,355!2025-03-18,19,355-->
  - sample mean / sample sum ::@:: The sample mean but without dividing by _N_. Same properties as sample mean, except multiply the expected value (mean) by _N_ and variance by _N_<sup>2</sup> (hence multiply standard deviation by _N_). <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,355!2025-03-18,19,355-->
    - sample mean / sample sum / pooling ::@:: Calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) for a sample versus a sample sum (_n_ samples). We can see the latter's CV is divided by $\sqrt n$. This shows pooling can reduce variability. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,355!2025-03-16,17,355-->
      - sample mean / sample sum / pooling / examples ::@:: In retailing, prefer consolidated distribution over direct delivery. In queueing, prefer pooled queues over dedicated queues. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,355!2025-05-20,68,355-->
- [normal distribution](../../../../general/normal%20distribution.md) ::@:: The __normal distribution__ or __Gaussian distribution__ is important in statistics and is often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. Their importance is partly due to the central limit theorem. It is denoted $\mathcal N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, where $\mu \in \mathbb R$ is the mean and $\sigma^2 \in \mathbb R_{> 0}$ is the variance. <p> Note: When you see $\mathcal N(0, 100)$, do not mistake the 100 as the standard deviation! It is the variance. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,17,355!2025-03-17,18,355-->
  - normal distribution / motivation ::@:: Many probability distributions in OM can be described by normal distributions... Further, normal distributions can be standardized easily. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,355!2025-03-17,18,355-->
  - normal distribution / shape ::@:: All normal distribution have the bell-shaped regardless of its parameters. Changing the mean simply translates the shape, while increasing the variance fattens (becomes wider) and flattens (the maximum value becomes lower) the shape. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,17,355!2025-05-13,62,355-->
  - normal distribution / standard normal distribution ::@:: The __standard normal distribution__ has the mean, $\mu$, 0, and the variance, $\sigma^2$, 1. Its CDF is commonly denoted by $\Phi(z)$ while its PDF is commonly denoted by $\varphi(z)$. <p> A property of its CDF due to the even symmetry of its PDF: $$\Phi(-z) = 1 - \Phi(z) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,355!2025-03-17,18,355-->
  - normal distribution / standardization ::@:: Any normal distribution can be __standardized__ by defining the random variable $$Z = \frac {X - \mu} {\sigma} \qquad X = \sigma Z + \mu \,.$$ Further, $$z = \frac {x - \mu} \sigma$$ is also known as the __standard score__ of the data _x_. <p> After standardization, a standard normal table that provides $\Phi(z)$ for different values of _z_ may be used to evaluate the CDF of any normal distribution. (The table may not show negative values of _z_. In that case, you need to use the property of its CDF above.) <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,355!2025-03-16,17,355-->

## week 3 lecture

- datetime: 2025-02-17T10:30:00+08:00/2025-02-17T11:50:00+08:00
- topic: managing uncertainty in service system, basics of queueing system
- [queueing theory](../../../../general/queueing%20theory.md)
  - queueing theory / motivation (OM) ::@:: Consider offering a service. Ideally there should be no variability in both arrival and service time, since in that case ensuring the utilization is below 100% suffices to avoid waiting. But in practice there are variability, which can cause waiting even if utilization is below 100%. The cause are that: one, services cannot be buffered (stored), unlike goods; two, there is short-term (temporary) mismatch between demand and supply. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,355!2025-03-18,19,355-->
    - queueing theory / motivation (OM) / examples ::@:: call centers, hospitals, restaurants, theme parks <!--SR:!2025-05-19,68,355!2025-03-16,17,355-->
  - queueing theory / why study ::@:: It can model queueing systems. Then we can describe its performance (description; e.g. queue length, waiting time) and improve it (optimization; e.g. reduce waiting time). For services, it can improve customer services, enhance their satisfaction, and increase our profits. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,17,355!2025-03-17,18,355-->
  - queueing theory / queueing model ::@:: It can be described as _customers_ lining up in _queues_ to be served by _servers_. For simplicity, we assume any server can serve any customer here. <p> Many models require customer arrival (random) distribution, service time (random) distribution, and system configuration (e.g. FIFO, \# of queues, \# of servers). Then the model can tell us the system performance, e.g. average customers in a queue or the system, average waiting time in a queue or the system. <!--SR:!2025-05-20,68,355!2025-03-16,17,355-->
  - queueing theory / server ::@:: A server is necessary resources to serve one customer _independently_ at _one time_. $n$ servers means you can at most server $n$ customers simultaneously. Note that a server does not necessarily correspond to a single machine or person. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,355!2025-03-17,18,355-->
  - queueing theory / inter-arrival time ::@:: Time between two consecutive arrivals of customers. It can be random. <p> The others can be inferred from knowing one of these: arrival time, inter-arrival time, total arrivals. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,17,355!2025-03-16,17,355-->
  - queueing theory / service time ::@:: Time to serve a customer. It can be random. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,355!2025-03-16,17,355-->
  - queueing theory / arrival time ::@:: The time when a certain customer arrives. It can be random. <p> The others can be inferred from knowing one of these: arrival time, inter-arrival time, total arrivals. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,355!2025-03-18,19,355-->
  - queueing theory / total arrivals ::@:: The number of customers that has arrived up to a time. It can be random. <p> The others can be inferred from knowing one of these: arrival time, inter-arrival time, total arrivals. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,17,355!2025-03-17,18,355-->
  - queueing theory / note ::@:: The term _waiting time_ usually refers to the average _queue_ waiting time, excluding the _service time_. <!--SR:!2025-04-03,23,376!2025-04-05,25,379-->
- [M/M/c queue](../../../../general/M_M_c%20queue.md) (slides: M/M/s model) ::@:: M/M/c: _exponential_ inter-arrival time/_exponential_ service time/number of servers; assume one FIFO (first-in first-out)/FCFS (first-come first-serve) queue <p> However, we prefer to use rates instead of time. Exponential distributions in terms of _time_ can be converted into Poisson distributions in terms of _rate_. So arrival rate and service capacity follow Poisson instead. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,355!2025-03-18,19,355-->
  - M/M/c queue / inputs ::@:: arrival _rate_ (follows Poisson distribution): $\lambda$, average service _rate_ of _one_ server (follows Poisson distribution): $\mu$, number of servers: $c$ (slides: $s$), number of queues: 1 (fixed) <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,355!2025-05-14,63,355-->
  - M/M/c queue / assumptions ::@:: Since arrival rate and and average service rate are parameters of a Poisson distribution, we assume occurrences are independent. In this context, this means number of arrivals in two different periods (arrival rate \* period length) and inter-arrival times are independent. <p> In this course, we assume $\lambda < c \mu$. That is, on average, we can serve customers faster than they can come, so that our queues will not become unbounded (infinite). <!--SR:!2025-03-16,17,355!2025-05-20,68,355-->
  - M/M/c queue / capacity, flow rate ::@:: The arrival rate $\lambda$ is the flow rate. The service rate $\mu$ is the capacity of _one_ server. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,17,355!2025-03-16,17,355-->
  - M/M/c queue / server utilization ::@:: Calculated as: $\rho = \frac {\lambda} {c \mu} \,,$ which can be interpreted as the average fraction a server is busy. The _stable_ condition is when $\rho < 1$, i.e. $\lambda < c \mu$ (serve customers faster than they can come), which is what we have assumed above. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,355!2025-03-18,19,355-->
  - M/M/c queue / performance metrics ::@:: average queue/system length, average queue/system waiting time, probability of waiting on arrival (queue being nonempty), server utilization <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,355!2025-03-18,19,355-->
  - M/M/c queue / average queue waiting time, average system waiting time ::@:: $W_s = W_q + \frac 1 \mu \,,$ where $W_s$ is average system waiting time and $W_q$ is average queue waiting time. They can be interpreted as flow time. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,355!2025-03-18,19,355-->
  - M/M/c queue / average queue length, average system length ::@:: $L_s = L_q + c \rho \,,$ where $L_s$ is average system length and $L_q$ is average queue length. They can be interpreted as average inventory. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,355!2025-03-17,18,355-->
  - M/M/c queue / Little's law ::@:: $L_s = \lambda W_s \qquad L_q = \lambda W_q$ <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,355!2025-03-17,18,355-->
- [M/M/1 queue](../../../../general/M_M_1%20queue.md) ::@:: M/M/1: _exponential_ inter-arrival time/_exponential_ service time/1 server; assume one FIFO (first-in first-out)/FCFS (first-come first-serve) queue <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,355!2025-03-16,17,355-->
  - M/M/1 queue / server utilization ::@:: Assuming the system is stable ($\lambda < \mu$). It is: $\rho = \frac \lambda \mu \,,$ since $c = 1$. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,355!2025-05-19,68,355-->
  - M/M/1 queue / system length distribution ::@:: Assuming the system is stable ($\lambda < \mu$). The probability of having $n$ customers in the system (including the one being served): $P_n = \rho^n (1 - \rho)$, a _unshifted_ geometric distribution with the success probability $1 - \rho$. <p> Intuition: Each $\rho$ term corresponds to the probability of adding 1 customer to the queue. $1 - \rho$ corresponds to the probability of ending the queue, which is independent of the number of customers being added. <!--SR:!2025-04-01,26,315!2025-05-20,68,355-->
  - M/M/1 queue / probability of waiting ::@:: Assuming the system is stable ($\lambda < \mu$). This equals the probability of having nonzero customers in the system: $1 - P_0 = 1 - (1 - \rho) = \rho$, which equals server utilization (intuitively). <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,355!2025-03-18,19,355-->
  - M/M/1 queue / average system length ::@:: Assuming the system is stable ($\lambda < \mu$). $L_s = \frac {\lambda} {\mu - \lambda} = \frac {\rho} {1 - \rho}$, the mean of a _unshifted_ geometric distribution with the success probability $1 - \rho$. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,18,355!2025-04-27,46,335-->
  - M/M/1 queue / average queue length ::@:: Assuming the system is stable ($\lambda < \mu$). $L_q = \rho L_s = \frac {\lambda} {\mu} \frac {\lambda} {\mu - \lambda} = \frac {\rho^2} {1 - \rho}$ <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,355!2025-03-16,17,355-->
  - M/M/1 queue / average system waiting time ::@:: Assuming the system is stable ($\lambda < \mu$). $W_s = \frac {L_s} {\lambda} = \frac 1 {\mu - \lambda}$ <!--SR:!2025-03-16,17,355!2025-04-01,26,315-->
  - M/M/1 queue / average queue waiting time ::@:: Assuming the system is stable ($\lambda < \mu$). $W_q = \frac {L_q} {\lambda} = \frac \rho {\mu - \lambda}$ <!--SR:!2025-03-16,17,355!2025-03-16,17,355-->
  - M/M/1 queue / insight ::@:: The average system length being $\frac {\rho} {1 - \rho}$ implies that it grows super-linearly (growth that is faster than linear) as $\rho$ approaches 1. That means it is very costly (congestion) to have near maximum utilization when there are variations. With no variations, congestion will not happen even if $\rho < 1$ is very near 1. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,19,355!2025-03-16,17,355-->

- attendance
- M/M/1 queue
- M/M/c queue
  - M/M/c queue / difference from M/M/1 queue ::@:: Arrival rate $\lambda$ and service rate (of _one_ server) $\mu$ means the same thing. The only difference is that $c$ is not restricted to being 1. <p> We still assume the system is _stable_, i.e. $\lambda < c \mu$. <!--SR:!2025-03-23,18,366!2025-03-20,15,346-->
  - M/M/c queue / metrics ::@:: Similar to that of M/M/1 queue, we have: $L_q$, $L_s$, $W_q$, $W_s$, $P(0)$, $P(\mathrm{delay})$, and $\rho$. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
    - M/M/c queue / metrics / equations ::@:: Unfortunately, there are equations for the performance of the system, but many of them are complicated, so we provide a M/M/c queueing spreadsheet for you instead. <!--SR:!2025-03-23,18,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
    - M/M/c queue / metrics / equations (simple) ::@:: Little's law; utilization $\rho = \lambda / c \mu$; relation between $L_q$ and $L_s$: $L_s = L_q + c \rho$; and relation between $W_q$ and $W_s = W_q + \frac 1 \mu$ still hold. <p> However, $P(\mathrm{delay})$ can be less than $1 - P(0)$ instead of being equal to, since there can be multiple servers now. Indeed, $P(\mathrm{delay}) = 1 - (P(0) + P(1) + \cdots + P(c - 1)) \,.$ <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-20,15,346-->
  - M/M/c queue / benefits over M/M/1 queue ::@:: Average queue length, average system length, average waiting time, and probability of waiting all decrease significantly. <!--SR:!2025-03-20,15,346!2025-03-20,15,346-->
- queueing theory
  - queueing theory / cost ::@:: There can be many ways to measure cost. One simple way is: <p> &emsp; total cost (per unit of time) = service cost (per unit of time) + waiting cost (per unit of time) <p> where service cost is proportional to number of servers $S$ while waiting cost is proportional to mean queue length $L_q$ (_not_ mean system length $L_s$). So we have: $$C = C_s S + C_w L_q \,,$$ where $C_s$ is the service cost per server (per unit of time) and $C_w$ is the waiting cost per customer (per unit of time). <!--SR:!2025-03-20,15,346!2025-03-19,14,346-->
    - queueing theory / cost / optimization ::@:: To optimize it, find where the total cost is minimum. <p> To compare two scenarios, compare their total costs and choose the one that is lower. Irrelevant costs (cost that do not differ between the scenarios) can be ignored. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-20,15,346-->
    - queueing theory / cost / insight ::@:: How many servers should we add? It is not the case that more servers is better. This is because while service cost grows linearly wth number of servers, waiting cost does not shrink linearly: an example of diminishing returns. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,19,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
  - queueing theory / pooled vs. separate ::@:: Pooled queue (1 queue for all servers) and separate queue (1 queue per server) can be compared using queue theory. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,19,366!2025-03-23,18,366-->
    - queueing theory / pooled vs. separate / models ::@:: Let $\lambda'$ be the arrival rate, $\mu'$ be the service rate of _one_ server, and $s$ be the number of servers. Then: <p> (former): M/M/c model with $\lambda = \lambda', \mu = \mu', c = s$ <br/> (latter) M/M/1 model with $\lambda = \lambda' / s, \mu = \mu', c = 1$. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,19,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
    - queueing theory / pooled vs. separate / results ::@:: We see that the utilization $\rho$ is still the same, but significantly less average queue waiting time $L_q$ for the former. <p> Indeed, as utilization approaches 1, while $L_q$ for both goes to infinity quickly, the former does so significantly slower than the latter. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,19,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
    - queueing theory / pooled vs. separate / insight ::@:: In the former, it is impossible for someone to be in queue while there are server being idle. This is possible in the latter. So this is why the former performs better than the latter: it leads to better _matching_ between _supply and demand_. <p> So how should we pool the servers? If we _only_ care about waiting time, then we should pool all servers together. Even if this is not possible, some initial degree of pooling still yields most of the improvements (with further pooling yielding diminishing returns). <!--SR:!2025-03-23,18,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
    - queueing theory / disadvantages ::@:: The advantages are obvious. But there are also disadvantages. The queue is more crowded/longer. As a result, customers _feel_ they have less ownership, and there may be negative behavioral and psychological effects on them. <p> Remember that _feelings of your customers_ sometimes matter as much as the _actual_ waiting time, and it all depends on the situation. <!--SR:!2025-03-23,18,366!2025-03-20,15,346-->

- topic: queueing system, simulation method
- M/M/1 queue
- M/M/c queue
- [G/G/1 queue](../../../../general/G_G_1%20queue.md) ::@:: M/M/1: _general_ (unknown distribution) inter-arrival time/_general_ (unknown distribution) service time/1 server; assume one FIFO (first-in first-out)/FCFS (first-come first-serve) queue <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
  - G/G/1 queue / motivation ::@:: In M/M/1 queue, we assume inter-arrival times and service times follow exponential distributions. But this may not hold in many situations. If we drop the above assumption, then we get this model. <p> Note that M/M/1 (_not_ M/M/c though) is a _special case_ of this. <!--SR:!2025-03-20,15,346!2025-03-25,20,366-->
  - G/G/1 queue / parameters ::@:: arrival: average rate $\lambda$, coefficient of variation $\text{CV}_a$ (use the distribution of the inter-arrival time, e.g. exponential) <br/> service: average rate $\mu$ (average service time: $T_p = 1 / \mu$), coefficient of variation $\text{CV}_p$ (use the distribution of the service time, e.g. exponential) <!--SR:!2025-04-11,28,326!2025-03-25,20,366-->
  - G/G/1 queue / average queue waiting time ::@:: It is given by the [Kingman's formula](../../../../general/Kingman's%20formula.md): $$W_q = \left(\frac \rho {1 - \rho}\right) \left(\frac {\text{CV}_a^2 + \text{CV}_p^2} 2 \right) T_p \,.$$ <p> Note that this is the _queue_ average waiting time, not _system_ average waiting time. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-23,18,366-->
    - [Kingman's formula](../../../../general/Kingman's%20formula.md)
    - G/G/1 queue / average queue waiting time / utilization factor ::@:: The term is $\frac \rho {1 - \rho}$. Higher utilization increases the average waiting time. The effect of it is very similar to that of M/M/1 queue and M/M/c queue: it grows super-linearly (growth that is faster than linear) as $\rho$ approaches 1. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,19,366!2025-03-24,19,366-->
    - G/G/1 queue / average queue waiting time / variability factor ::@:: The term is $\frac {\text{CV}_a^2 + \text{CV}_p^2} 2$. Higher variability in inter-arrival time or service time increases the average waiting time. <!--SR:!2025-03-20,15,346!2025-03-25,20,366-->
    - G/G/1 queue / average queue waiting time / service time factor ::@:: The term is $T_p = \frac 1 \mu$. Obviously, the longer the service time, the longer the waiting time. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-24,19,366-->
  - G/G/1 queue / other performance metrics ::@:: Little's law; utilization $\rho$; relation between $L_q$ and $L_s$: $L_s = L_q + \rho$ ($c = 1$); and relation between $W_q$ and $W_s = W_q + \frac 1 \mu = W_q + T_q$ still hold. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-24,19,366-->
  - G/G/1 queue / special case: M/M/1 queue ::@:: In M/M/1 queue, $\lambda$ and $\mu$ have the same values. For coefficients of variation: $\text{CV}_a = \frac {\sqrt{1 / \lambda^2} } {1 / \lambda} = 1$ and $\text{CV}_p = \frac {\sqrt{1 / \mu^2} } {1 / \mu} = 1$, since for exponential distributions, both mean and standard deviation are the same. <p> This means we have: $$W_q = \left(\frac \rho {1 - \rho} \right) \left(\frac {1^2 + 1^2} 2 \right) T_p = \frac \rho {1 - \rho} \frac 1 \mu = \frac {\lambda} {\mu - \lambda} \frac 1 \mu = \frac \rho {\mu - \lambda} \,,$$ which is the same as above. <!--SR:!2025-03-15,10,326!2025-03-19,14,346-->
  - G/G/1 queue / special case: no variability ::@:: Assume the system is stable, i.e. utilization is below 1. We can see that if there are no variability for both inter-arrival time and service time, then $CV_a = CV_p = 0$. The formula tells us that the average queue waiting time is 0, as expected. <!--SR:!2025-04-03,23,376!2025-04-03,23,376-->
- [patience](../../../../general/patience.md)
  - patience / psychology of waiting ::@:: anxiety, comfortableness, explainability, fairness, occupancy, progress, social, uncertainty <!--SR:!2025-03-20,15,346!2025-03-19,14,346-->
    - patience / psychology of waiting / occupancy ::@:: Unoccupied time feels longer than occupied time. <p> mitigations: Divert customer's attention while waiting, e.g. entertain, enlighten, and engage (Katz et al., 1991). <!--SR:!2025-03-19,14,346!2025-03-23,18,366-->
    - patience / psychology of waiting / progress ::@:: Pre-process/pre-progress waiting feels longer than in-process/in-progress waiting. <p> mitigations: Minimize the first queue waiting time to avoid balking. Quick "foot in the door". <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-23,18,366-->
    - patience / psychology of waiting / anxiety ::@:: It makes waiting feels longer. <p> mitigations: Ensure customers do not feel forgotten. Serve new or infrequent customers keeping in mind that they feel they wait longer (due to uncertainty causing anxiety). <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-23,18,366-->
    - patience / psychology of waiting / uncertainty  ::@:: Uncertain waiting feels longer than known and finite waiting. <p> mitigations: Inform customers how long to expect, e.g. a wait time noticeboard. One may _surprise_ the customer with a shorter actual waiting time. <!--SR:!2025-03-23,18,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
    - patience / psychology of waiting / explainability ::@:: Unexplained waiting feels longer than explained waiting. <p> mitigations: Provide (real) reasons to keep customers waiting, e.g. on a noticeboard. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,19,366!2025-03-23,18,366-->
    - patience / psychology of waiting / fairness ::@:: Unfair waiting feels longer than fair/equitable waiting. <p> mitigations: Design the system to ensure fairness, e.g. FCFS (first-come first-serve). <!--SR:!2025-03-23,18,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
    - patience / psychology of waiting / comfortableness ::@:: Uncomfortable waiting feels longer than comfortable waiting. <p> mitigations: Design a more comfortable waiting environment, e.g. adding sofas. <!--SR:!2025-03-20,15,346!2025-03-24,19,366-->
    - patience / psychology of waiting / social ::@:: Solo waiting feels longer than group waiting. <p> mitigations: Design a more social waiting environment that encourages interactions. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
    - patience / psychology of waiting / importance ::@:: How long customers _actually_ wait is as important as how long customers _feel_ like they have waited. In some cases, it is possible that customers _actually_ wait longer but they _feel_ like they have waited less. <!--SR:!2025-03-20,15,346!2025-03-25,20,366-->
- [simulation](../../../../general/simulation.md) ::@:: an imitative representation of a process or system that could exist in the real world <!--SR:!2025-03-20,15,346!2025-03-25,20,366-->
  - simulation / motivation ::@:: What if a system (e.g. queue system) is complex enough (e.g. queue abandonment, queue deterioration, queue layers) that no closed formulas exist? Make a model that _mimics_ the real system, that incorporates its dynamics and _variability_. Then we can _estimate_ _average_ system performance metrics after running the simulation for many times or for a long time period. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-19,14,346-->
  - simulation / applications ::@:: financial investments (backtesting, estimating stock prices), inventory ordering (estimating order amount), waiting lines <!--SR:!2025-03-24,19,366!2025-03-15,10,326-->
  - simulation / advantages ::@:: It can handle very complex systems. It can answer "what if"/counterfactual questions. It does not interfere with the real system (since you are running a model of it). <!--SR:!2025-03-23,18,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
  - simulation / disadvantages ::@:: It does not necessarily yield an _exact_ and _optimal_ solution. The model may not completely reflect the real system. It requires good inputs from the management (i.e. garbage in, garbage out). <!--SR:!2025-03-24,19,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
  - simulation / key ingredients ::@:: dynamics/evolution (how it evolves, e.g. decision making), performance measures (how it performs, e.g. portfolio return, inventory costs), variability sources (where it varies, e.g. arrival time, processing time), randomness (how to model its variability, e.g. distribution of random variables) <!--SR:!2025-03-20,15,346!2025-03-19,14,346-->
- [Monte Carlo method](../../../../general/Monte%20Carlo%20method.md) ::@:: a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
  - Monte Carlo method / steps ::@:: define the problem, define performance variables and _representative_ random variables → generate random variables → identify relations between random and performance variables → run simulation and inspect results <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-04-11,28,326-->
  - Monte Carlo method / define the problem ::@:: What is the problem you are trying to solve? It could be estimating a performance metric of your queue system. <!--SR:!2025-03-20,15,346!2025-03-24,19,366-->
  - Monte Carlo method / define performance variables and _representative_ random variables ::@:: _Representative_ random variables are _exogenous_ (not determinable from the system dynamics only) random variables determining the system dynamics, e.g. inter-arrival time, service time, etc. <p> Performance variables are the metrics that you are interested in finding out to help you solve the problem. They are usually determined by the system dynamics given the representative random variables, eg. waiting time in queue, etc. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-25,20,366-->
  - Monte Carlo method / generate random variables ::@:: Collect data from the real world. Then set up its probabilistic model, balancing analytical convenience vs. fitting power for reality. Finally, sample the random variable according to its distribution (using the field of probability and statistics). <!--SR:!2025-03-20,15,346!2025-03-23,18,366-->
  - Monte Carlo method / identify relations between random and performance variables ::@:: Determine how system dynamics relate the variables in the system. The relations start from the representative random variables. Intermediate variables may be used, e.g. arrival time, service completion time, service start time, etc. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,19,366!2025-03-24,19,366-->
  - Monte Carlo method / run simulation and inspect results ::@:: This highly depends on how you make the model, e.g. using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and its `RAND()` function, etc. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,20,366!2025-03-20,15,346-->

The expected payoff of an action is the weighted sum of the payoffs of its random _scenarios_ given the action, weighted by the scenario _probabilities_. <p> Since we choose the action with the best payoff, the _expected value of the whole tree_ is the payoff of the best action. <p> For multiple periods, use _backward induction_ as described below. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,25,379!2025-04-05,25,376-->
    - decision tree / expected value / note ::@:: In practice, we also need to consider the decision _risk_, not just the expected payoff. <!--SR:!2025-04-04,24,379!2025-04-04,24,379-->
  - decision tree / solution ::@:: Use _backward induction_ to find the _optimal_ action. <p> Start from the _last period_, and find the expected payoffs of all _actions_. Propagate the expected payoff of the _best_ action as the payoff of the corresponding random scenario of the previous period. Repeat until you have reached the _first period_. The action in the first period with the highest payoff is the _optimal_ action _right now_, and is also the _expected value_. <!--SR:!2025-03-29,18,356!2025-04-05,25,379-->
- [backward induction](../../../../general/backward%20induction.md) ::@:: It is the process of determining a sequence of optimal choices by reasoning from the endpoint of a problem or situation back to its beginning using individual events or actions. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,25,379!2025-04-03,23,376-->
- [expected value of perfect information](expected%20value%20of%20perfect%20information.md) \(EVPI\) ::@:: It is the price that one would be willing to pay in order to gain access to perfect information. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,25,376!2025-04-04,24,379-->
  - expected value of perfect information / idea ::@:: The scenarios are still _random_, but you can know them _before_ making the decision. <!--SR:!2025-04-04,24,379!2025-04-04,24,379-->
  - expected value of perfect information / equation ::@:: \(expected\) value _of_ perfect information = expected value _under_ perfect information − expected value \(_without_ perfect information\) <!--SR:!2025-04-06,26,379!2025-04-04,24,379-->
  - expected value of perfect information / expected value _under_ perfect information ::@:: _List_ all scenarios. If there are multiple periods, combinations of all scenarios across periods. Compute their _probabilities_, either given, or calculated if across periods. <p> Then, for each combination of scenarios, compute the expected value of the decision tree again, but the random scenarios are fixed by the combination. <p> Finally, _sum_ the above expected values _weighted_ by their probabilities, and this is the expected value _under_ perfect information. <!--SR:!2025-04-06,26,379!2025-04-04,24,379-->
- decision tree
  - decision tree / summary ::@:: Information about the future is valuable (actually information in general is valuable). Thus it is desirable to reduce uncertainty as soon as possible. <!--SR:!2025-04-04,24,379!2025-04-04,24,379-->
  - decision tree / summary / uncertainty reduction ::@:: data analytics, demand forecasting, feasibility study, market research, etc. <!--SR:!2025-04-06,26,379!2025-04-05,25,379-->
