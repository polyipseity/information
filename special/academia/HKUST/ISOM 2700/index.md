- cumulative inflow/outflow chart ::@:: A cumulative chart with two lines, with the _x_-axis being time and _y_-axis being the number of units. One line is the _cumulative inflow_, which increases by 1 every time a flow unit enters the process. The other line is the _cumulative outflow_, which increases by 1 every time a flow unit exits the process. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,18,318!2025-02-27,11,298-->
  - cumulative inflow/outflow chart / _x_-gap ::@:: The _x_-gap at a particular _y_ is the flow time for the _y_-th unit. The average _x_-gap is the average flow time. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,18,318!2025-03-06,18,318-->

  - cumulative inflow/outflow chart / slope ::@:: The average slope of the cumulative inflow is the input flow rate. The average slope of the cumulative output flow rate. <p> These two average slopes should be the same for a _stable process_. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,11,298!2025-03-06,18,318-->
  - cumulative inflow/outflow chart / relation ::@:: y-gap = x-gap × slope; this is also known as Little's law <!--SR:!2025-03-06,18,318!2025-03-05,18,318-->
- [Little's law](../../../../general/Little's%20law.md) ::@:: It is a theorem by John Little which states that the long-term average number _L_ (_I_: average inventory) of customers in a stationary system is equal to the long-term average effective arrival rate _λ_ (_R_: average flow rate) multiplied by the average time _W_ (_T_: average flow time) that a customer spends in the system. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,18,318!2025-03-06,18,318-->

  - Little's law / conditions ::@:: It holds for _all stable processes_, regardless of complexity (e.g. multiple flow units), sequence (e.g. FIFO, LIFO), and randomness (e.g. arrival time, flow time). <p> A _stable process_ is a process where the average rate of input equals the average rate of output, so inventory does not accumulate to infinity as time passes by. <!--SR:!2025-02-26,11,298!2025-02-27,11,298-->
  - Little's law / implications ::@:: Given the conditions are satisfied, one is that we can find one variable from the other two variables in the set of variables _I_, _R_, and _T_. It also means there are trade-offs when setting management goals. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,18,318!2025-03-04,17,318-->
  - Little's law / example ::@:: customers in supermarkets: The amount of time spent by a customer in a supermarket is important to the management. We can use Little's law to find the average time customers spend in the store. <!--SR:!2025-03-04,17,315!2025-03-05,18,318-->

## week 2 lecture

- datetime: 2025-02-10T10:30:00+08:00/2025-02-10T11:50:00+08:00
- topic: bottleneck analysis, throughput analysis
- [bottleneck](../../../../general/bottleneck%20(production).md) ::@:: a process in a chain of processes, such that its limited capacity reduces the capacity of the whole chain <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,341!2025-03-14,19,341-->
  - bottleneck / motivation ::@:: _Process capacity_ is the _maximum_ flow rate. _Bottlenecks_ determine the process capacity. This is useful for improving process capacity, since bottlenecks determine the process capacity, we should prioritize improving the bottleneck. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,341!2025-03-13,18,341-->
- [law of the minimum](../../../../general/Liebig's%20law%20of%20the%20minimum.md) ::@:: For a process to produce a unit, every resource must finish its own job. Thus, the process capacity is determined by the slowest resource. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,341!2025-03-13,18,341-->
  - law of the minimum / examples ::@:: The capacity of a barrel with staves of unequal length is limited by the shortest stave. <p> A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. <p> The flow rate of an irregular pipe is limited by its narrowest gap. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,341!2025-03-14,19,341-->
- [bottleneck](../../../../general/bottleneck%20(production).md)
  - bottleneck / identification ::@:: List activities, resources (workers to perform activities), and processing times. Assign resources to activities (the assignment can be very complex). For each resource (not activity), compute its workload needed to produce a unit and thus its _capacity_. Finally, identify the _bottleneck resource_, which is the resource with the _lowest_ capacity. <!--SR:!2025-03-04,10,301!2025-03-13,18,341-->
    - bottleneck / identification / scenarios ::@:: In general, multiple resources can be assigned to multiple tasks, with AND/OR connecting the resources. <p> For this course, we consider 3 simple scenarios: one-to-one (each resource is required by exactly one activity), and (one resource is needed in multiple activities), and or (one activity can be performed by multiple resources). <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,341!2025-03-13,18,341-->
    - bottleneck / identification / one-to-one ::@:: Simple. Simply find the resource with the _lowest_ capacity. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,341!2025-03-13,18,341-->
    - bottleneck / identification / and ::@:: Determine activities by each resources that is required to produce a unit. Find the time required per unit, and thus its capacity. Then find the resource with the _lowest_ capacity. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,341!2025-03-13,18,341-->
    - bottleneck / identification / or ::@:: Pool multiple resources that can perform the same process into one, effectively treating the resource as one. Its capacity is the sum of the capacities of the multiple resources. Then find the resource with the _lowest_ capacity. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,341!2025-03-14,19,341-->
    - bottleneck / identification / random process ::@:: Sometimes, only a percentage (not all) units flow from a process (process A) to another process (process B). In this case, we should find process B's _effective_ capacity from its actual capacity. It can be obtained by dividing its actual capacity by the percentage of units that flow from process A to process B. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,341!2025-03-14,19,341-->
- [production leveling](../../../../general/production%20leveling.md) (line balancing) ::@:: By moving capacity to bottlenecks or moving workload to underutilized resources, we can balance the workload among resources in the process. This helps raise the capacity of bottlenecks and reduces _supply—demand mismatch_ within the process. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,12,321!2025-03-14,19,341-->
  - production leveling / examples ::@:: flexible line layouts: Operators can move nearby instead of being stuck to a fixed location to self-balance the workload. It also makes it easier to add or remove operators. <br/> U-shaped lines: Operators do not need to move as much to reach a process that is further away. Less operators are also needed as operators can work on multiple processes that are far away from each other. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,341!2025-03-08,13,321-->
- [capacity utilization](../../../../general/capacity%20utilization.md) ::@:: flow rate / resource capacity <p> It measures how much of the resource capacity is being used. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,341!2025-03-14,19,341-->
- [bottleneck](../../../../general/bottleneck%20(production).md)
  - bottleneck / utilization ::@:: Given the flow rate is the same for all resources (which may _not_ be the case if the process is random), if a resource has lower capacity, it has higher utilization. So the bottleneck can also be stated as the resource with _highest utilization_. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,341!2025-03-08,13,321-->
- [capacity utilization](../../../../general/capacity%20utilization.md)
  - capacity utilization / utilization profile chart ::@:: Plot a bar chart of each resource and its utilization (in percentage). <!--SR:!2025-03-07,12,321!2025-03-14,19,341-->
    - capacity utilization / utilization profile chart / interpretation ::@:: Given the flow rate is the same for all resources (which may _not_ be the case if the process is random), the resource with the highest utilization is the _bottleneck_. The gap between the highest utilization and the lowest utilization is the _imbalance_ relative to the bottleneck. The gap between 100% and the highest utilization is the _mismatch between supply and demand_ (explained below). <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,341!2025-03-07,12,321-->
- flow rate
  - flow rate / input, process capacity, potential demand ::@:: It is the minimum between input, process capacity, and potential demand. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,341!2025-03-13,18,341-->

  - capacity utilization / process utilization ::@:: It is defined as the _bottleneck_ utilization. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,19,341!2025-03-14,19,341-->
    - capacity utilization / process utilization / lower than 100% ::@:: Given the flow rate is the same for all resources (which may _not_ be the case if the process is random), this means the process is _not_ capacity-constrained, but either input-constrained or demand-constrained (or both). <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,341!2025-03-13,18,341-->

- [capacity utilization](../../../../general/capacity%20utilization.md)
  - capacity utilization / complex processes ::@:: If the process have multiple flow units or is complex with different paths, e.g. patients of different severity, then we calculate the _implied utilization_ for each resource. The _bottleneck_ is the resource with the highest _implied utilization_ (this is true even for complex processes). <!--SR:!2025-03-07,12,321!2025-03-14,19,341-->
  - capacity utilization / implied utilization ::@:: demand for a resource over all types of flow units / capacity of a resource <p> It can be higher than 100%, implying that the capacity cannot meet the demand. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,18,341!2025-03-14,19,341-->

- topic: OM and finance, inventory turnover analysis, ROIC tree, basic statistics concepts
- [operations management](../../../../general/operations%20management.md)
  - operations management / accounting & finance ::@:: It plays an important role in understanding and improving a firm's financial performance. <p> Examples are inventory costs, inventory turnover, and return on invested capital (ROIC). <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
- [inventory](../../../../general/inventory.md) ::@:: It refers to the goods and materials that a business holds for the ultimate goal of resale, production or utilization. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-24,3,306-->
  - inventory / importance ::@:: They are everywhere. So it is an important signal for managers and analysts to determine how well a retailer is running its business. <p> An empirical analysis for over 353 publicly listed U.S. retailers for the period 1985–2003 inventory shows: 57% publicly traded retailers has inventory as the largest asset on the balance sheet. On average, the inventory takes up 35.1% of total assets. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,3,286!2025-02-24,3,306-->
  - inventory / benefits ::@:: economics of scale (i.e. produce more than the _current_ demand), meet variation in demand or processes (e.g. unexpected shocks), interdependence between operations (the inventory act as a buffer) <!--SR:!2025-02-24,3,306!2025-02-24,3,306-->
  - inventory / costs ::@:: carrying/holding costs, overhead costs (e.g. ordering, production change, setup), shortage costs (due to lost sales) <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - inventory / inventory turnover ::@:: $$\frac 1 {\text{flow time} } = \frac {\text{\# units sold in a period (flow rate)} } {\text{\# units in inventory (inventory)} } = \frac {\text{COGS in a period} } {\text{average inventory at cost} }$$ <p> The first equality is by Little's law. The second equality is by multiplying average purchase cost on both top and bottom, since we generally do not know the numbers of units in inventory and sold in financial statements. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-24,3,306-->
    - inventory / inventory turnover / sources ::@:: _Flow time_ is how long a unit spends in the inventory before being sold. COGS in a period and _average_ inventory at (purchasing) cost can be obtained from financial statements. <!--SR:!2025-02-24,3,306!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - inventory / weeks of supply ::@:: This is basically how long the _average_ inventory at cost can last (assuming no new purchases), in number of weeks. <p> To calculate it, it is the _reciprocal_ of inventory turnover multiplied by _52_ weeks. It is also the flow time (which is in years) multiplied by _52_ weeks. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - inventory / per unit inventory holding cost ::@:: It measures the holding cost per unit relative to the unit's purchase cost. <p> To calculate it, divide annual inventory holding cost (in % of average inventory) by annual inventory turnover. <p> The ke insight is that each inventory turnover "refreshes" the average inventory. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-03-04,9,306-->
  - inventory / inventory turnover
    - inventory / inventory turnover / interpretation ::@:: It can evaluate a firm's performance by comparing it with firms in the _same_ sector, since it can vary drastically across sectors (e.g. from 6.70 in consumer sector to 48.76 in finance sector). <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
- [return on invested capital](../../../../general/return%20on%20capital.md) (ROIC) ::@:: It is a ratio used in finance, valuation and accounting, as a measure of the profitability and value-creating potential of companies relative to the amount of capital invested by shareholders and other debtholders. <p> It is calculated as: return (NOPAT) / average invested capital, where NOPAT is net operating income after tax <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - return on invested capital / economic value created ::@:: economic value created = capital \* (ROIC - WACC), where WACC is the weighted average cost of capital <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - return on invested capital / OM ::@:: We can use the DuPont model to see how ROIC is related to OM measures, e.g. flow rate. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - return on invested capital / [DuPont analysis](../../../../general/DuPont%20analysis.md) ::@:: ROIC = return (NOPAT) / average invested capital = (return / revenue) \* (revenue / invested capital) = margin \* asset turnover <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-24,3,306-->
    - return on invested capital / DuPoint analysis / OM ::@:: margin = 1 − fixed costs / (_flow rate_ \* price) − variable costs / price <br/> asset turnover = _flow rate_ \* price / invested capital <!--SR:!2025-02-24,3,306!2025-03-05,10,306-->
      - return on invested capital / DuPoint analysis / OM / margin ::@:: Increasing flow rate increases margin by dividing the fixed costs by a larger denominator. This means the fixed costs are spread throughout more units. (Imagine infinite flow rate: fixed cost would be negligible compared to variable cost.) <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-03-08,13,326-->
      - return on invested capital / DuPoint analysis / OM / asset turnover ::@:: Increasing flow rate increases asset turnover by increasing revenue by simply selling more units in a period for the same amount of invested capital. <!--SR:!2025-02-24,3,306!2025-02-24,3,306-->
  - return on invested capital / what-if analysis ::@:: Using DuPoint analysis, we can quickly figure out how increase in flow rate increases ROIC. <p> To calculate them, calculate the old and new ROIC. You can then calculate the (percentage) increase in ROIC. You can also calculate the increase in return by multiplying the ROIC difference with the invested capital (assuming the invested capital remains the same). <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-24,3,306-->
- [random variable](../../../../general/random%20variable.md) (r.v.) ::@:: A __random variable__ (__r.v.__) is a mathematical function. Its _domain_ is the sample space. Its _range_ is a measurable space, usually a finite set of integers or the real numbers. The function need not be _injective_ (different samples need not map to different values). It is commonly denoted by capital letters, with its possible numerical values (also called __realizations__) by the same but lowercase letters. <p> A way to think about random variable is that it maps each outcome to a real number. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - random variable / for business ::@:: Many random variables in practice can be described by mean and variance (square of standard deviation). The exact distribution can be specified using a cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F(Q)$ or probability density function (PDF) $f(q)$ (actually for discrete values, it should be probability mass function (PMF)). <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - random variable / motivation ::@:: Demand for a product or service is usually random. Demand forecasting is important in OM (learn later/below), and is done by obtaining demand distribution from historical or survey data. <p> But before we do that, how do we describe demand more mathematically? Random variables can do so. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-24,4,326-->
- [cumulative distribution function](../../../../general/cumulative%20distribution%20function.md) (CDF, cdf) ::@:: A __cumulative distribution function__ (__CDF__, __cdf__) of a real-valued random variable _X_ is the probability that _X_ will take a value less than or equal to _x_. It is given by: $$F_X(x) = P(X \le x) \,.$$ The probability that _X_ will take a value in between \(_a_, _b_\], where _a_ < _b_, is $$P(a < X \le b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
- [probability density function](../../../../general/probability%20density%20function.md) (PDF, pdf) ::@:: The __probability density function__ (__PDF__, __pdf__) of an _absolutely continuous_ random variable is a function whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a _relative likelihood_ that the value of the random variable would be equal to that sample. <p> Probability density is the probability per unit length, in other words, the _absolute likelihood_ for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 since there is an infinite set of possible values to begin with. <p> It is commonly denoted $f_X(x)$ for an absolutely continuous random variable _X_. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
- [probability mass function](../../../../general/probability%20mass%20function.md) (PMF, pmf) ::@:: A __probability mass function__ (__PMF__, __pmf__) is a function that gives the probability that a _discrete random variable_ is exactly equal to some value. It is given by: $$p_X(x) = P(X = x) \,.$$ It is not defined for a continuous random variable. <p> The PMF has the following properties: $$\begin{aligned} \sum_x p_X(x) & = 1 \\ p_X(x) \ge 0 \,. \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
- [expected value](../../../../general/expected%20value.md) ::@:: The __expected value__ (__population mean__, __first moment__) is a generalization of the weighted average. Informally, the expected value is the mean of the possible values a random variable can take, weighted by the probability of those outcomes. It is commonly denoted $E(X)$. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - expected value / discrete random variable ::@:: The expected value of a discrete random variable is the weighted average of all possible outcomes $\mathcal X$: $$\operatorname E[X] = \sum_{x \in \mathcal X} x p(x) \,.$$ <p> (optional, uncovered) This is only defined if the sum converges absolutely, so it is possible for a discrete random variable to have a undefined expected value. <p> Also, $$\operatorname E[g(X)] = \sum_{x \in \mathcal X} g(x) p(x) \,.$$ for an arbitrary function $g(x)$. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - expected value / continuous random variable (optional) ::@:: The expected value of a continuous random variable is the weighted average of all possible outcomes $\mathcal X$: $$\operatorname E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \! x f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x \,\mathrm{d}F(x) \,.$$ <p> (uncovered) This is only defined if the integral converges absolutely, so it is possible for a continuous random variable to have a undefined expected value. <p> Also, $$\operatorname E[g(X)] = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \! g(x) f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} g(x) \,\mathrm{d}F(x) \,.$$ for an arbitrary function $g(x)$. <!--SR:!2025-02-24,3,306!2025-02-25,4,326-->
- [coefficient of variation](../../../../general/coefficient%20of%20variation.md) ::@:: It is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation (_not_ variance) $\sigma$ to the mean $\mu$, $CV={\frac {\sigma }{\mu } }$. <p> It shows the extent of variability in relation to the mean of the population. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-24,4,326-->
  - coefficient of variation / OM ::@:: Widely used in OM to measure the degree of variation for different objectives. It shows the core OM idea of _standardization_. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-24,4,326-->
- [sample mean](sample%20mean%20and%20covariance.md)
  - sample mean / equation ::@:: Given _N_ samples of a random variable _X_, its _sample mean_ is: $$\overline X = \frac 1 N \sum_{k = 1}^N X_k \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-24,4,326-->
  - sample mean / properties ::@:: It is _unbiased_: $\operatorname E[\overline X] = \mu_X$. It has a variance that is inversely proportional to the number of samples: $\operatorname{Var}(\overline X) = \frac {\sigma_X^2} N$ (hence $\operatorname{Sd}(\overline X) = \frac {\sigma_X} {\sqrt N}$). <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - sample mean / sample sum ::@:: The sample mean but without dividing by _N_. Same properties as sample mean, except multiply the expected value (mean) by _N_ and variance by _N_<sup>2</sup> (hence multiply standard deviation by _N_). <!--SR:!2025-02-24,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
    - sample mean / sample sum / pooling ::@:: Calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) for a sample versus a sample sum (_n_ samples). We can see the latter's CV is divided by $\sqrt n$. This shows pooling can reduce variability. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
      - sample mean / sample sum / pooling / examples ::@:: In retailing, prefer consolidated distribution over direct delivery. In queueing, prefer pooled queues over dedicated queues. <!--SR:!2025-02-24,3,306!2025-02-25,4,326-->
- [normal distribution](../../../../general/normal%20distribution.md) ::@:: The __normal distribution__ or __Gaussian distribution__ is important in statistics and is often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. Their importance is partly due to the central limit theorem. It is denoted $\mathcal N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, where $\mu \in \mathbb R$ is the mean and $\sigma^2 \in \mathbb R_{> 0}$ is the variance. <p> Note: When you see $\mathcal N(0, 100)$, do not mistake the 100 as the standard deviation! It is the variance. Almost screwed this up in the midterm examination... <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - normal distribution / motivation ::@:: Many probability distributions in OM can be described by normal distributions... Further, normal distributions can be standardized easily. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - normal distribution / shape ::@:: All normal distribution have the bell-shaped regardless of its parameters. Changing the mean simply translates the shape, while increasing the variance fattens (becomes wider) and flattens (the maximum value becomes lower) the shape. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - normal distribution / standard normal distribution ::@:: The __standard normal distribution__ has the mean, $\mu$, 0, and the variance, $\sigma^2$, 1. Its CDF is commonly denoted by $\Phi(z)$ while its PDF is commonly denoted by $\varphi(z)$. <p> A property of its CDF due to the even symmetry of its PDF: $$\Phi(-z) = 1 - \Phi(z) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
  - normal distribution / standardization ::@:: Any normal distribution can be __standardized__ by defining the random variable $$Z = \frac {X - \mu} {\sigma} \qquad X = \sigma Z + \mu \,.$$ Further, $$z = \frac {x - \mu} \sigma$$ is also known as the __standard score__ of the data _x_. <p> After standardization, a standard normal table that provides $\Phi(z)$ for different values of _z_ may be used to evaluate the CDF of any normal distribution. (The table may not show negative values of _z_. In that case, you need to use the property of its CDF above.) <!--SR:!2025-02-25,4,326!2025-02-25,4,326-->
