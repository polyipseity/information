# MIPS

- HKUST COMP 2611

## principles

This seems more like a pedagogical tool...

- good compromises ::@:: Instructions are 32 bits long, to make instruction fetching and decoding simpler.
- make common cases fast ::@:: Variants of instructions that accept _immediate_ operands instead of register or memory operands are available.
- simplicity favors regularity \(less cases\) ::@:: Each instruction is 32 bits long, and has a fixed number of operands. It makes CPU implementations simpler and allows better performance.
  - simplicity favors regularity / comparison ::@:: x86, a _complex_ instruction set computer \(CISC\) ISA, supports a variable number of operands.
- smaller is faster ::@:: Less registers means faster processors. More registers means more propagation delay \(longer travel time\).

## registers

Registers are {@{_fast_ temporary storage _inside_ the processor \(not on the main memory \(RAM\)\) used to hold _data_}@}. There is {@{a limited number}@} of registers.

Variables differ from registers in that {@{the former is a logical concept while the latter is a physical thing}@}. Thus, there can be {@{an unlimited number of variables}@}.

In MIPS, there are {@{32 registers}@}. They can be identified by {@{their names (depends on the _calling convention_) or their numbers \(from `$0` to `$31`\)}@}. They can hold {@{a _word_, which is 32 bits in size}@}. Commonly used registers include: {@{the readonly zero register `$zero` \(`$0`\), saved temporary registers `$s0`–`$s7` \(`$16`–`$23`\), \(non-saved\) temporary registers `$t0`–`$t7` \(`$8`–`$15`\), etc.}@}

Almost always, {@{the number of variables in a program is much higher than the number of registers}@}. To {@{store those data}@}, {@{register values are transferred from and to the main memory, but with more propagation delay}@}.

The number of registers {@{is a balancing act: it should not be too few or too many}@}. If there are too few, {@{the potentially many variables need to be frequently transferred from and to the main memory \(RAM\), leading to performance loss}@}. If there are too many, {@{processors are more complicated, have higher clock cycle time, which also leads to performance loss}@}.

\(this course: Note that when doing questions, {@{do not assume registers have a specific value, e.g. 0, unless otherwise specified}@}. That is, you need to {@{initialize its value}@}.\)

## memory

The main memory is usually {@{a physical RAM}@}. It can {@{store much data, much more than the registers}@}.

In MIPS, {@{the main memory cannot be manipulated directly}@}. Instead, {@{values need to be transferred from _registers_ to the main memory, and vice versa}@}.

We can treat the main memory as {@{a _contagious_ storage locations}@}. Each storage location {@{stores a byte, which has a size of 8 bits}@}. The storage location are addressed by {@{indices starting from 0}@}. Usually, addresses are {@{written in hexadecimal}@}.

In MIPS, to address a memory location, we need {@{a base address and an offset}@}. The base address is {@{provided by a register, while the offset is provided by a constant}@}. The actual address is {@{simply the sum of the base address and the offset}@}. Often, the base address is {@{the starting address of an array}@}, while the offset is {@{an array index _multiplied_ by the array element size \(in higher level programming languages, e.g. C, this multiplication is done for you\)}@}. {@{The _memory operand_ syntax}@} is {@{`offset($base)`, e.g. `-4($s0)`}@}.

### endianness

When {@{addressing multiple bytes}@}, it is important to {@{take note of _endianness_: _big endian_ and _little endian_}@}. {@{A _big-endian_ system}@} stores {@{the most significant byte of a word at the smallest memory address and the least significant byte \(word _end_\) at the largest}@}. {@{A _little-endian_ system}@} stores {@{the least-significant byte \(word _end_\) at the smallest address}@}. It also describes {@{the order of byte transmission over a digital link}@}.

For {@{assembly instructions that store multi-byte data}@}, it {@{uses the endianness of the underlying machine, so that you do not need to worry about endianness when defining data}@}.

Note that it does not make sense to {@{talk about the endianness of a register, as they have no memory addresses}@}. When transferring multiple bytes from and to the main memory, big-endian systems {@{stores them in the main memory in big-endian, transfers them to registers by interpreting them in big-endian, and receives them from registers by writing them in big-endian}@}, and {@{vice versa for little-endian}@}. In both cases, {@{the data transfer instructions are agnostic of the endianness, i.e. does not need to care about the endianness}@}.

## instructions

Each instruction is written as {@{`ins op_1, op_2, ..., op_n`, where `ins` is the instruction and `op_i` are its operands}@}. Each line {@{contain at most one instruction}@}. Comments {@{start with `#` and end with a newline}@}.

Below, the accompanying code to the right is {@{a piece of pseudo C code showing its semantics}@}. For placeholders:

- `$s`, `$t`, and `$d` \(in order of instruction encoding\) ::@:: It can be any 32-bit named/numbered register \(5 bits to encode\).
- `imm` ::@:: It can be any 16-bit constant, which may be unextended, sign-extended, or zero-extended depending on the instruction.
- `offset` ::@:: It can be any 16-bit signed constant. It can represent a signed 16-bit byte offset, or an address or label representable by a signed 16-bit 4-byte offset \(effectively 18 bits\) from the current instruction.
- `target` ::@:: It can be any 26-bit unsigned constant. It can represent an address or label that has its upper 4 bits same as the current instruction \(the lower 28 bits can be different, and the lower 2 bits must be 0\).
- `PC` ::@:: It is the 32-bit address of the current instruction \(program counter\).
  - `nPC` ::@:: It is the 32-bit address of the _next_ instruction \(next program counter\), i.e. `PC + 4`.
- `h` ::@:: It can be any 5-bit unsigned constant. It is used for bit-shit instructions.

Common instruction variants include {@{immediate `_i`, unsigned `_u`}@}. The former {@{indicates that the instruction takes an 16-bit immediate operand in place of a register operand}@}. The latter {@{indicates that the instruction interprets the operands as unsigned integers, and additionally does not _trap_ on _overflow_}@}. Note that {@{signed integers in MIPS are always encoded using two's complement}@}.

One would notice that {@{some reasonable instructions are missing}@}. This is an example of {@{good design compromise between expressiveness and too many instructions reducing performance of all instructions}@}.

### program counter

{@{The program counter \(PC\) or instruction address register}@} contains {@{the 32-bit address of the current instruction}@}. The _concept_ {@{next program counter \(nPC\)}@} contains {@{the next instruction to be executed}@}. Every time {@{an instruction is executed}@}, {@{the PC is updated to the nPC, and nPC is usually added 4 \(next instruction\)}@}. Note that some instruction {@{causes nPC to be added by an offset \(e.g. relative jump instructions\) or causes nPC to be set to a register \(e.g. semi-absolute jump instructions\)}@}. {@{The `goto` in the pseudo C code below}@} is {@{meant to indicate this}@}. Note that in these cases, {@{the PC is still updated to the nPC before updating the nPC}@}, e.g. {@{the next instruction in memory after a jump instruction is still executed}@}. This is why {@{_branch delay slots_ \(mentioned below\) are added after jump instructions}@}. This also explains why {@{PC-relative addressing mode is based on nPC or `PC + 4`}@}.

\(this course: For this course, {@{you do not need to know _branch delay slots_}@}. But you do need to know that {@{if there is a branch, the PC will need be _flushed_, which allures to the above concept of that nPC instead of PC is updated by branching instructions}@}.\)

The program counter {@{cannot be read or written directly}@}. However, it can be indirectly read {@{using `jal`, where the PC of the `jal` instruction _plus 8_ \(for MARS and this course, use _plus 4_\) is saved to `$ra`}@}. It is indirectly written {@{by executing instructions, or branching and jump instructions}@}.

### operands

There are {@{3 types of operands}@} \(at least in this course\) in MIPS: {@{immediate \(constant\) operand, memory operand, and register operand}@}. Note that the first one is {@{limited to 16 bits \(see instruction encoding\)}@}, and {@{for _arithmetic_ operations \(e.g. excludes _bitwise_ operations), is always _sign-extended_}@}.

In terms of {@{execution time}@}, {@{immediate \(constant\) operands}@} are {@{the fastest as they are encoded in the instruction}@}. {@{Register operands}@} are {@{still fast since registers are inside to the processor}@}. {@{Memory operands}@} are {@{extremely slow comparatively since they are very far comparatively from the processor}@}. This is why {@{there are multiple variants of the same operation, but with one accepting immediate operands}@}.

Note that while {@{`$zero` or `$0`}@} has {@{the semantics of _constant_ zero}@}, it is {@{_not_ a constant operand but a register operand}@}. So {@{it can only be used in locations where a register operand is expected}@}.

### arithmetic instructions

- add ::@:: `add $d, $s, $t`: `$d = $s + $t;`, signed, traps on overflow
- add immediate ::@:: `addi $t, $s, imm`: `$t = $s + imm;`, signed, traps on overflow; `imm` is sign-extended

  - add immediate unsigned / note ::@:: Recall that in two's complement, at a bit level, addition is the same as that for unsigned integers. Thus, for two's complement, `addiu` can be used in place of `addi` to avoid trapping on overflow.
- add unsigned ::@:: `addu $d, $s, $t`: `$d = $s + $t;`, unsigned, does not trap on overflow
  - add unsigned / note ::@:: Recall that in two's complement, at a bit level, addition is the same as that for unsigned integers. Thus, for two's complement, `addu` can be used in place of `add` to avoid trapping on overflow.
- divide ::@:: `div $s, $t`: `$LO = $s / $t; $HI = $s % $t;`, signed; `$LO` \(quotient\) is rounded towards zero, while `$HI` \(remainder\) is such that `$s == $t * $LO + $HI`

  - subtract unsigned / note ::@:: Recall that in two's complement, at a bit level, subtraction is the same as that for unsigned integers. Thus, for two's complement, `subu` can be used in place of `sub` to avoid trapping on overflow.

- bitwise nor ::@:: `nor $d, $s, $t`: `$d = ~($s | $t);`

- branch on greater than or equal to zero and link ::@:: `bgezal $s, offset`: `if ($s >= 0) { $ra = PC + 8; goto nPC + offset << 2; }` \(`PC + 8` instead of `PC + 4` is due to a branch delay slot; for MARS and this course, ignore this and treat it as the next instruction: `PC + 4`\)
- branch on greater than zero ::@:: `bgtz $s, offset`: `if ($s > 0) { goto nPC + offset << 2; }`

- jump register ::@:: `jr $s`: `goto $s;`

- set on less than unsigned ::@:: `sltu $d, $s, $t`: `$d = $s < $t;`, unsigned

### miscellaneous instructions

- no operation ::@:: `noop`: does nothing; encoded by all 0s, which represents `sll $0, $0, 0` \(in fact, _almost all_ instruction that has `$0` as its destination register does nothing\)
- syscall ::@:: `syscall`: generates a software interrupt

### encoding

All instructions are {@{4 bytes \(32 bits\) long}@}. This is an example of {@{the principle regularity}@}. There are {@{3 formats: R format \(for R instructions\), I format \(for I instructions\), and J format \(for J instructions)}@}. Multiple formats {@{increases hardware complexity, but the formats are kept similar to try to reduce this}@}. Below, the format fields {@{start from higher bits to lower bits}@}.

- R format ::@:: all operands are registers \(ignoring the "immediate" operand in bit-shift instructions\) without offsets <p> opcode: 6 bits → rs: 5 bits → rt: 5 bits → rd: 5 bits → shift \(shamt\): 5 bits → funct: 6 bits
- I format ::@:: one operand is immediate \(the "immediate" operand in bit-shift instructions is not really immediate\) or an offset is present <p> opcode: 6 bits → rs: 5 bits → rt: 5 bits → imm: 16 bits
- J format ::@:: the only operand is an pseudo-address <p> opcode: 6 bits → pseudo-address: 26 bits

The format fields include {@{opcode, rs, rt, rd, shift \(shamt\), funct, imm, and pseudo-address}@}. They mean:

- opcode ::@:: 6 bits; opcode of the instruction; R format: this is almost always 0, since the funct field is used instead
- rs ::@:: 5 bits; R format: first source register operand; I format: source or memory register operand
- rt ::@:: 5 bits; R format: second source register operand; I format: destination or non-memory register operand
- rd ::@:: 5 bits; R format: destination register operand
- shift \(shamt\) ::@:: 5 bits; R format: number of bits to shift, ranging from 0 to 31 \(i.e. unsigned\), and should almost always be 0 for non-bit-shift instructions
- funct ::@:: 6 bits; R format: opcode of the instruction, and is almost always used instead of the opcode field
- imm ::@:: 16 bits; I format: a 16-bit immediate constant that may be unextended, sign-extended, or zero-extended depending on the instruction, a signed 16-bit offset, or an address or label representable by a signed 16-bit 4-byte offset \(effectively 18 bits\) from the current instruction
- pseudo-address ::@:: 26 bits; J format: a 26-bit unsigned constant, representing an address or label that has its upper 4 bits same as the current instruction \(the lower 28 bits can be different, and the lower 2 bits must be 0\)

The register fields are encoded {@{by the named registers' corresponding number name}@}.

For {@{bit-shift instructions}@}, note that {@{unlike other instructions, for variable bit-shift instructions, `$s` \(the rs field\) is on the right hand side instead of the left hand side, and `$t` \(the rt field\) is on the left hand side instead of the right hand side}@}. Also, {@{for "immediate" bit-shift instructions, `$s` \(the rs field\) is unused}@}. For {@{instructions taking a single register operand only}@}, {@{`$s` is usually used, and `$d` \(R format\) or `$t` \(I format\) is used if the register is to be written \(e.g. `lui`, `mfhi`, `mflo`\)}@}.

Notice that {@{some fields are unused}@}. Sometimes, {@{they can be any value \(and we would not care\), but sometimes not}@}, so it is {@{best to always set unused fields to all 0s \(unless otherwise specified\)}@}.

## calling conventions

There are {@{two _major_ calling conventions}@} for MIPS: {@{O32, N32/N64}@}. We will {@{use O32}@} for this course.

Also take note of {@{callee-saved \(preserved on call\) and caller-saved registers}@}. This is explained in [§ procedures](#procedures) below.

### O32 calling convention

The 32 registers are used as follows:

| Name            | Number      | Use                                                                       | Callee must preserve?                                                                                                   |

The caller places {@{procedure arguments in `$a0`–`$a3` \(4 registers\)}@} \(if you have more arguments, {@{they will need to be passed in the stack}@}\). Then it {@{invokes `jal` to jump to the procedure \(callee\)}@}. The callee saves {@{`$ra` to the stack using the pseudo-instruction `push`}@}. Then it {@{executes}@}. Then it places {@{the return value in `$v0`–`$v1` \(2 registers\) \(the 2 registers are usually used together to hold a 64-bit value\)}@}. Then it {@{pops the stack to `$ra` using the pseudo-instruction `pop`, and returns to the caller by `jr $ra`}@}.

## assembly

{@{The assembler}@} is {@{responsible for translating human-readable assembly to machine-readable machine code}@}. That means we need to {@{learn how to write the human-readable assembly file}@}.

### assembly format

Comments {@{start with `#` and end with a newline}@}. {@{Labels}@} are {@{like "bookmarks" of the program}@}, so that {@{you can reference the "bookmark" from other assembly lines by its name}@}. Its syntax is {@{`(label name): (code)`}@}. To {@{load the address of a label into a register}@}, use {@{the _pseudo-instruction_ `la $reg, (label name)` \(load address\)}@}. To {@{specify a location to jump to in an instruction}@}, {@{simply use the label name}@}.

In a program, you usually {@{have 2 segments: `.data` and `.text`}@}. To begin such a segment, {@{simply start it with the segment header `.(segment name)` in its own line}@}. Then, {@{all text after this line and before the next segment header}@} belongs to that segment. In {@{the `.data` segment}@}, you {@{put data inside}@}. You can {@{modify the data while executing the program using the instruction `sw`}@}. In {@{the `.text` segment}@}, you {@{put runnable code inside \(the name "text" is quite un-descriptive, but this is historical convention...\)}@}.

In the `.data` segment, {@{data are stored into the memory _contagiously_ in declaration order}@}. The first byte of data {@{may have an arbitrary memory address, called _offset_}@}, and {@{later bytes are stored contagiously \(sometimes with small padding between different data for _alignment_\) after the first byte}@}.

{@{The above "instructions" starting with a period `.`}@} are {@{more properly called _assembler directives_}@}. They include directives that {@{specify alignment, data, strings, symbol visibility, etc.}@} They are {@{not actual MIPS instructions}@} since {@{they are processed by the assembler during assembly rather than run during program execution}@}.

### assembly directives

- `.align <n>` ::@:: _Align_ the _next_ datum on a 2<sup>_n_</sup>-byte boundary. That is, the next datum starts at an address that is a multiple of 2<sup>_n_</sup>. <p> If _n_ is 0, automatic _alignment_ is turned off, since 2<sup>0</sup> = 1, which is effectively no alignment.
- `.ascii <str>` ::@:: Stores a non-null-terminated \(ASCII\) string.
- `.asciiz <str>` ::@:: Stores a null-terminated \(ASCII\) string.
- `.byte <b1>, ..., <bn>` ::@:: Stores the specified _n_ bytes \(8 bits\).
- `.data` ::@:: Starts the data segment.
- `.double <d1>, ..., <dn>` ::@:: Stores the specified _n_ doubles \(64 bits, 8 bytes\).
- `.float <f1>, ..., <fn>` ::@:: Stores the specified _n_ floats \(32 bits, 4 bytes\).
- `.globl <sym>` ::@:: \(The name is _not_ a typo!\) Declare the symbol `<sym>` is global. The symbol is not removed from the resulting object/program file. That is, other assembly files can reference it. This is also required for the entry point label, so that the OS knows where to start the program.
- `.half <h1>, ..., <hn>` ::@:: Stores the specified _n_ half-words \(16 bits, 2 bytes\).
- `.space <num>` ::@:: Reserves the specified number of _bytes_. This can be used to define global but uninitialized variables.
- `.text [<addr>]` ::@:: Starts the code \(text\) segment, starting at the \(optional\) address `<addr>`.
- `.word <w1>, ..., <wn>` ::@:: Stores the specified _n_ words \(32 bits, 4 bytes\).

### entry point

The convention is {@{the entry point \(first instruction to be executed when a program starts\) is labeled by the label `.__start`}@}. Additionally, {@{the label needs to be global, specified using `.globl __start`}@}. For example, a way to start a program is: <p> {@{<pre>.text<br/>.globl \_\_start<br/>\_\_start:<br/># your instructions here</pre>}@}.

## control flow

In {@{higher level programming languages}@}, we have {@{`do-while`, `if`, `for`, `while`, etc. for control flow}@}. In MIPS, we have {@{`beq` (branch if equal), `bne` (branch if not equal), and `j` (jump) for control flow}@}. These, {@{coupled with comparison instructions \(introduced below\)}@}, can {@{support implementing all conventional control flow structures in higher level programming languages}@}, and additionally {@{allows for unconventional \(less readable\) control flow}@}.

To {@{convert structured control flow statements into assembly}@} manually, {@{identify _basic blocks_, which is a sequence of consecutive code that has no branching _to_ and _from_ other code}@}. Then, {@{a control flow graph can be constructed out of these basic blocks}@}. Finally, {@{_label_ the basic blocks at their beginnings and add conditional and/or unconditional jumps at their endings}@} to {@{model the control flow graph}@}. \(this course: Include {@{the beginning label and the ending conditional and/or unconditional jumps}@} in a basic block.\) {@{A compiler}@} {@{essentially does the same thing automatically}@}, and {@{with additional optimizations \(e.g. reordering\) for performance and/or code size}@}. Also, during program execution, {@{an advanced processor}@} may {@{identify instructions that form basic blocks and accelerate them}@}.

To convert {@{an `if...else if...else` statement}@}, a common pattern is {@{a bunch of comparison and conditional jumps to the basic blocks, then the basic blocks each ending with a jump to the exit label, and finally the exit label at the end}@}. To convert {@{an `while` statement}@}, a common pattern is {@{a loop label, then comparison and conditional jump to the exit label, the code, and finally a jump to the loop label}@}. You can extrapolate the rest for yourself. You may also simplify the code.

## pseudo-instructions

Since {@{MIPS have few instructions}@}, some common code {@{requires multiple instructions}@}. Pseudo-instructions are {@{_assembler macros_ that help replace these multiple instructions with a single line}@}. Since {@{these instructions are not real}@}, they are {@{replaced by multiple instructions implementing the pseudo-instruction during assembly}@}, and thus {@{does not appear in the resulting program file}@}. Note that this also means {@{the set of pseudo-instructions available is not standardized and may vary across different assemblers}@}. That means {@{some pseudo-instructions below may not be usable in your assembler}@}.

The benefit of pseudo-instructions is that {@{they simplify your code to make it more understandable}@}. The _only_ cost is that {@{a register, `$at`, is reserved for use to replace pseudo-instructions with real instructions by the assembler}@}. \({@{Requiring multiple instructions is _not_ a cost}@} since {@{with or without pseudo-instructions, you still need multiple instructions unless the architecture makes it a real instruction}@}.\)

- absolute ::@:: `abs $d, $s`: `$d = abs($s)`; implemented by `addu $d, $zero, $s; bgez $d, 8; sub $d, $zero, $s;`
- branch on less than ::@:: `blt $s, $t, offset`: `if ($s < $t) { goto nPC + offset << 2; }`; implemented by `slt $at, $s, $t; bne $at, $zero, offset;`
- branch on less than or equal to ::@:: `ble $s, $t, offset`: `if ($s <= $t) { goto nPC + offset << 2; }`; implemented by `slt $at, $t, $s; beq $at, $zero, offset;`
- branch on greater than ::@:: `bgt $s, $t, offset`: `if ($s > $t) { goto nPC + offset << 2; }`; implemented by `slt $at, $t, $s; bne $at, $zero, offset;`
- branch on greater than or equal to ::@:: `bge $s, $t, offset`: `if ($s >= $t) { goto nPC + offset << 2; }`; implemented by `slt $at, $t, $s; beq $at, $zero, offset;`
- load address ::@:: `la $d, addr`: `$d = &addr;`, but `addr` is an address or label; implemented by `lui $at, addr[16:32]; ori $d, $at, addr[0:16];`
- load immediate ::@:: `li $d, imm`: `$d = imm;`, but `imm` is a 32-bit unsigned integer; implemented by `lui $at, imm[16:32]; ori $d, $at, imm[0:16];`
- move ::@:: `mov $d, $s`: `$d = $s;`; implemented by `add $d, $zero, $s;`
- negate ::@:: `neg $d, $s`: `$d = -$s;`; implemented by `subu $d, $zero, $s;`
- not ::@:: `not $d, $s`: `$d = ~$s;`; implemented by `nor $d, $zero, $s;`
- pop ::@:: `$pop [$d=$ra]`: pops a 32-bit value from the stack to `$d`; implemented by `lw $d, 0($sp); addi, $sp, $sp, 4;`
- push ::@:: `$push [$s=$ra]`: pushes the 32-bit value of `$s` to the stack; implemented by `addi $sp, $sp, -4; sw $s, 0($sp);`
- set on greater than ::@:: `sgt $d, $s, $t`: `$d = $s > $t;`; implemented by `slt $d, $t, $s;`
- set on greater than or equal to ::@:: `sge $d, $s, $t`: `$d = $s >= $t`; implemented by `slt $at, $s, $t; xori $d, $at, 1;`

Note that some pseudo-instructions have {@{the same name as some of the _real_ instructions}@}. Whether the instruction or the pseudo-instruction is {@{used depends on the operands}@}. For example, {@{the load word `lw` instruction}@} has {@{several related pseudo-instructions of the same name that does the same thing}@} but {@{for operands not following the format `lw $t, $s(offset)`}@}, which are provided for {@{convenience, e.g. loading data addressed by a label (`lw $t, label`), etc.}@}.

\(this course: Some questions may {@{require you to not use any pseudo-instructions}@}.\)

## procedures

In {@{higher level programming languages}@}, we have {@{functions/procedures/subroutines for to group related code and reuse them}@}. In MIPS, we can {@{emulate this feature}@}. Note that a high-level language compiler {@{does essentially the same thing when compiling your program, but they are abstracted away}@}.

Overall, to call a procedure in MIPS, the caller needs to {@{place the arguments/parameters in specified locations, then transfer control \(jump and link\) to the callee}@}. Then, the callee {@{pushes `$ra` to the stack, acquires the necessary resources, and performs its task}@}. Finally, {@{the callee places the return value \(if any\) in a specified location, pops the stack to `$ra`, and return control \(return\) to the caller}@}. The caller then {@{may access the return value for further use}@}. The specified locations are specified by {@{a calling convention}@}. Note that {@{if you do not call any other procedures in your procedure and your procedure does not modify `$ra` explicitly}@}, you can {@{skip pushing `$ra` to the stack at the beginning and popping `$ra` from the stack at the end}@}. \(this course: In this course, we use {@{the [O32 calling convention](#O32%20calling%20convention)}@}.\)

Also take note of {@{callee-saved \(preserved on call\) and caller-saved registers}@}. _Callee-saved_ means {@{the register value is the same before and after calling a procedure}@}. Note this does not mean {@{the register value cannot change during the procedure, just that the register value must be restored before returning}@}. One way to do so is {@{if the registers need to be modified during the procedure, save them to the stack and restore them before returning}@}. _Caller-saved_ means {@{there is no guarantee that the register value is the same before and after calling a procedure}@}. Note this does not mean {@{the register value _must_ change during the procedure, just that the caller cannot _rely_ on it being the same}@}.

## memory layout

A typical MIPS program memory is {@{addressed by 32-bit unsigned integers}@}. Thus, there are {@{2<sup>32</sup> memory byte locations, or 2<sup>30</sup> memory _word_ locations}@}.

It can be separated into {@{5 segments}@}: {@{\(in increasing address\) reserved, text, static data, dynamic data, and stack}@}. Tbe text segment {@{starts from 0x0040&nbsp;0000}@}. The static data {@{starts from 0x1000&nbsp;0000, but the global pointer `$gp` can be used to change this offset \(e.g. 0x1000&nbsp;8000\)}@} The dynamic data {@{comes after the static data \(no fixed memory address though\)}@}. The stack {@{is different: the previous segments grows in size towards increasing address, but the stack grows in size towards decreasing address}@}. It {@{starts from 0x7fff&nbsp;fffc \(0x8000&nbsp;0000 – 0x4\) \(stack pointer `$sp`\) and _decreases_ as it grow in size}@}.

The text segment {@{holds your code}@}, corresponding to {@{the `.text` segment in your assembly file}@}.

The static data segment {@{holds global variables}@}, corresponding to {@{the `.data` segment in your assembly file}@}.

The dynamic data segment is {@{the heap, and is allocated using `malloc` in C \(e.g. C++, Java: `new`\)}@}. It does not {@{correspond to any segment in your assembly file}@}.

The stack segment is {@{automatic storage, used to store local variables in higher level programming language}@}. It does not {@{correspond to any segment in your assembly file}@}. In MIPS, you use it to {@{store extra local variables more than that allowed by the number of registers, and the return address `$ra`}@}. To manipulate this segment, you can use {@{the pseudo-instructions `push` and `pop` to push or pop a 32-bit value to the stack}@}, which manipulates this segment {@{like the data structure _stack_, last-in first-out \(hence its name\)}@}. \(See above for what real instructions they translate to.\) The {@{address of the stack top}@} is {@{stored in `$sp`}@}.

## addressing modes

MIPS \(MIPS I\) have {@{only one addressing mode: base + displacement}@}.

\(this course: whole paragraph\) However, for this course, we consider addressing mode {@{to include referencing data, not just referencing memory in operands}@}. If so, we have {@{5 addressing mode}@}: {@{immediate, register, base \(+ displacement\), PC-relative, and pseudo-direct addressing}@}.

- immediate addressing ::@:: Not really an addressing mode... It refers to the 16-bit immediate field in an I instruction.
- register addressing ::@:: Not really an addressing mode... It refers to the register fields in an R or I instruction.
- base \(+ displacement\) addressing ::@:: Some I instructions interpret the 16-bit immediate field as an address offset from the value of the `$s` register. The `$s` is known as the _base_ and the offset is known as the _displacement_. The operand is written as `offset($s)`.
- PC-relative addressing ::@:: Some I instructions interpret the 16-bit immediate field as an address offset from the program counter \(PC\). These instructions are branch instructions. <p> The address offset is in _words_ \(4 bytes\), not _bytes_, since instructions are aligned to words. The address offset \(multiplied by 4\) is added to nPC \(or `PC + 4`\) to find the branch target \(the reason is mentioned above\). This means instructions up to 2<sup>15</sup> words/instructions or 128 kiB away are addressable. <p> Simply put, the branch address is `nPC + offset << 2` or `PC + 4 + offset << 2`.
- pseudo-direct addressing ::@:: The J instructions interpret the 26-bit pseudo-address as the jump target. <p> The address pseudo-address is in _words_ \(4 bytes\), not _bytes_, since instructions are aligned to words. So it can address the 28 lower bits of a 32-bit address or 256 MiB of memory, with the 2 lower bits always being 0. The 4 upper bits of a 32-bit address are provided by the 4 upper bits of the program counter \(PC\). This explains why it is called a "pseudo-address". <p> Simply put, the jump address is `(PC & 0xf0000000) | (offset << 2)`.

A problem with PC-relative addressing is that {@{the branch target may be too far away}@}. The assembler {@{may rewrite a branch instruction as a branch instruction followed by a jump instruction, so that pseudo-direct addressing can be used}@}. If pseudo-direct addressing is insufficient, {@{storing the 32-bit address into a register and using `jr` suffices}@}.

## miscellaneous

### 32-bit immediate

The immediate field can {@{only up to 16 bits}@}. A natural question arises: {@{How do we store a 32-bit signed/unsigned integer}@}? The answer is {@{using `lui` and `ori` together}@}. Since {@{this is a common operation}@}, {@{the pseudo-instruction `li` is available and does the same thing}@}.
