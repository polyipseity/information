# Scala 3

- HKUST COMP 3031

{@{__Scala__}@} is {@{a strongly statically typed high-level general-purpose programming language}@} that supports {@{both object-oriented programming and functional programming}@}.

## types

Every piece of data in Scala has {@{a type}@}.

### primitive types

{@{Primitive types}@} are {@{the most basic types in Scala}@} and {@{make up all other types}@}. The list of primitive types are {@{as in Java}@}, but {@{are capitalized}@}.

- `Boolean` ::@:: Either true or false. Example: `true`, `false`
- `Char` ::@:: A single character. Example: `'a'`, `'3'`, `' '`
- `Double` ::@:: A floating point number with double precision \(15 to 17 significant figures\). One can effectively treat it as a decimal number for most purposes. Example: `42d`, `5.`, `6.29d`, `3.12D`, `3.14`
- `Float` ::@:: A floating point number with single precision \(6 to 9 significant figures\). One can effectively treat it as a decimal number for most purposes. Example: `42f`, `1.f`, `3.14f`, `9.20F`
- `Int` ::@:: An integer. Example: `42`

## expressions

Scala supports {@{expressions}@}, including {@{arithmetic expressions}@}. {@{Parentheses \(`()`\)}@} can be used to {@{prioritize evaluating some expressions over others first}@}. {@{Semicolons \(`;`\) to end an expression}@} are {@{optional in most cases}@}. You need it if you {@{put multiple expressions in one line}@}.

Scala supports {@{conditional expressions}@}. Its syntax is {@{`if <predicate> then <expr if true> else <expr if false>`}@}. `<predicate>` is {@{always evaluated}@}. If {@{it is `true`}@}, then {@{`<expr if true>` is evaluated}@}. Else, {@{`<expr if false>` is evaluated}@}.

Scala supports {@{logical expressions}@}. They are {@{as in Java}@}, and includes {@{`true`, `false`, `!<expr>`, `<expr 1> && <expr 2>`, and `<expr 1> || <expr 2>`}@}. Evaluation uses {@{short circuiting}@}: If {@{`<expr 1>` evaluates to `true`}@}, then {@{`<expr 2>` is not evaluated in `<expr 1> || <expr 2>`}@}; if {@{`<expr 1>` evaluates to `false`}@}, then {@{`<expr 2>` is not evaluated in `<expr 1> && <expr 2>`}@}.

Scala supports {@{comparisons}@}. They are {@{as in Java}@}.

## definitions

To {@{give a name `<name>`}@} to {@{an expression `<expr>`}@}, use {@{`def <name>: <type> = <expr>`}@}. {@{`<type>`}@} is {@{optional if the type of `<expr>` can be _inferred_}@}. In particular, if {@{`<expr>` uses `<name>` \(recursion\)}@}, then {@{the type of `<expr>` needs to be specified}@}. Note that {@{`<expr>`}@} is not evaluated when {@{`<name>` is defined}@}. To {@{evaluate `<expr>` when `<name>` is defined}@}, use {@{`val` instead of `def`}@}.

Expressions can be {@{parameterized}@}. Use {@{`def <name>(<parm name 1>: <parm type 1>, ... <parm name N>: <parm type N>): <return type> = <expr>`}@}. {@{`<return type>`}@} is {@{optional if the type of `<expr>` can be _inferred_}@}. Expressions are evaluated by {@{replacing each occurrence of `<para name K>` by the actual parameters}@} when {@{the function is evaluated \(see [ยง evaluation](#evaluation)\)}@}.

## evaluation

The {@{2 major evaluation strategies for functions}@} are {@{call by value \(CBV\) and call by name \(CBN\)}@}. Scala by default uses {@{CBV}@}. To {@{specify CBN for a particular parameter}@}, {@{specify the type using `=> <type>` instead of `<type>`}@}.

## scoping

Scala {@{creates a new scope}@} using {@{braces \(`{}`\)}@}. Since {@{Scala 3}@}, {@{indentation after `=`, `then`, `else`, etc. can be used as well \(like Python\)}@}. The {@{last element \(statement\) of a scope}@} is {@{the expression that determines the value of that scope}@}. The motivation of scoping is to {@{avoid _namespace pollution_}@}.

Scala uses {@{lexical scoping}@} with {@{\(variable\) shadowing}@}. That is, {@{each occurrence of a name}@} refers to {@{the definition of the name appearing in the _innermost_ scope \(shadowing\) according to the _source code_ \(lexical scoping\)}@}.

Scala supports {@{_optional_ end markers}@} to {@{mark the end of a scope}@}. It must have {@{the same indentation as the opening keyword}@}.
