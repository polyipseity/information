- topic: logistics; introduction; elements of programming; termination; evaluation strategy; scoping
- COMP 3031
  - COMP 3031 / logistics
  - COMP 3031 / objectives ::@:: Scala, functional programming, programming language constructs, programming language paradigms
- [programming paradigm](../../../../general/programming%20paradigm.md) ::@:: It is a relatively high-level way to conceptualize and structure the implementation of a computer program.
  - programming paradigm / common ::@:: concurrent, dependently-typed, functional, imperative, logic, object-oriented, parallel, etc.
- [imperative programming](../../../../general/imperative%20programming.md) ::@:: It is a programming paradigm of software that uses statements that change a program's state.
  - imperative programming / important elements ::@:: control structures, mutation, etc.
  - imperative programming / physical correspondence ::@:: It has strong correspondence with physical entities. <p> control structure ↔ jump <br/> field ↔ memory cell <br/> variable ↔ register <br/> variable assignment ↔ store \(instruction\) <br/> variable dereferencing ↔ load \(instruction\) <br/> ...
- [von Neumann architecture](../../../../general/von%20Neumann%20architecture.md) ::@:: control unit, processing unit, memory, storage, input/output mechanisms
  - von Neumann architecture / von Neumann bottleneck ::@:: The use of the same bus to fetch instructions and data leads to the von Neumann bottleneck, the limited throughput \(data transfer rate\) between the central processing unit \(CPU\) and memory compared to the amount of memory. This seriously limits the effective processing speed when the CPU is required to perform minimal processing on large amounts of data. The CPU is continually forced to wait for needed data to move to or from memory.
    - von Neumann architecture / von Neumann bottleneck / trend ::@:: Since CPU speed and memory size have increased much faster than the throughput between them, the bottleneck has become more of a problem, a problem whose severity increases with every new generation of CPU.
- [theory](../../../../general/theory%20(mathematical%20logic).md) ::@:: It is a set of sentences in a formal language.
  - theory / for programming ::@:: data type\(s\), operation\(s\) on data type\(s\), law\(s\) on data and operations <br/> usually no mutations \(but possible with some difficulty\)
  - theory / mutation ::@:: A theory without mutation is usually much less complex than one with mutation. Mutation makes theories hard to understand. So most theories do not admit mutation. <p> For programming, this leads to _functional programming_.
- [functional programming](../../../../general/functional%20programming.md) ::@:: It is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.
  - functional programming / missing elements ::@:: imperative control structures, no mutations \(__this course__: In a _restricted sense_, these elements are strictly _forbidden_.\)
  - functional programming / important elements ::@:: functions \(as first-class citizens\), immutable data types \(__this course__: In a _wide sense_, these elements are _emphasized_ on, but unmentioned elements \(e.g. above\) are not strictly forbidden.\)
  - functional programming / function ::@:: As first-class citizens, they can be composed, definable anywhere, passed as parameters, etc.
  - functional programming / examples ::@:: restricted: FP, Pure Lisp, XPath, XQuery, XSLT, etc. <br/> wider: Clojure, F\#, Haskell, Lips, Ocaml, Racket, SML, Scala, Scheme, etc.
- COMP 3031
  - COMP 3031 / recommended books
- [Scala](../../../../general/Scala%20(programming%20language).md) ::@:: It is a strongly statically typed high-level general-purpose programming language that supports both object-oriented programming and functional programming. <p> \(__this course__: Use Scala 3.\)
  - Scala / Scala 3: [Scala 3](Scala%203.md)
- [programming language](../../../../general/programming%20language.md) ::@:: It is an artificial language for expressing computer programs.
  - programming language / elements ::@:: primitive expressions, composition of expressions, abstraction of expressions \(giving names to expressions\)
- [read–eval–print loop](../../../../general/read–eval–print%20loop.md) \(REPL\) ::@:: It is a simple interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise.
- Scala
  - Scala / Scala 3
    - [§ primitive types](Scala%203.md#primitive%20types): `Boolean`, `Int`, `Double`
    - [§ expressions](Scala%203.md#expressions): expressions, arithmetic expressions
    - [§ definitions](Scala%203.md#definitions): `def`
- [rewriting](../../../../general/rewriting.md) ::@:: It covers a wide range of methods of replacing subterms of a formula with other terms.
  - rewriting / substitution model ::@:: It is a way to _evaluate_ expressions _without side effects_. To evaluate a _function call_, each parameter to the function is evaluated from left to right. Then, replace the function call with the _function expression_, while _substituting_ each occurrence of the parameter name with the parameter value. <p> It is formalized in lambda calculus.
- [divergence](../../../../general/divergence%20(computer%20science).md) ::@:: A computation is said to __diverge__ if it does not terminate or terminates in an exceptional state. Otherwise it is said to __converge__.
  - divergence / example ::@:: Scala 3: `def loop: Int = loop; loop`
- [evaluation strategy](../../../../general/evaluation%20strategy.md) ::@:: It is a set of rules for evaluating expressions.
  - evaluation strategy / Scala 3 ::@:: 2 major evaluation strategies: call by name \(e.g., `def`, `=> <type>`\), call by value \(e.g., `val`\)
  - evaluation strategy / call by value \(CBV\) ::@:: Each parameter to the function is evaluated first. Then, to evaluate a function, each occurrence of each parameter is replaced by its corresponding value. <p> The advantage is if a parameter is used multiple times, only one evaluation is needed. The disadvantage is if a parameter is unused, one evaluation is still needed.
    - evaluation strategy / call by value / termination ::@:: If an expression terminates using CBN, it _may not_ terminate using CBV. This is because there may be some expressions evaluated by CBV are not evaluated by CBN. <p> Scala 3: Compare `def constant(x: Int) = 0; id(loop)` and `def constant(x: => Int) = 0; id(loop)`.
  - evaluation strategy / call by name \(CBN\) ::@:: Each parameter to the function is not evaluated. Rather, to evaluate a function, each occurrence of each parameter is replaced by its corresponding expression directly. <p> The advantage is if a parameter is used, no evaluation occurs. The disadvantage is each occurrence of a parameter evaluates the expression once.
    - evaluation strategy / call by name / termination ::@:: If an expression terminates using CBV, then it also terminates using CBN. This is because every expression evaluated by CBN is also evaluated by CBV.

- Scala
  - Scala / Scala 3
    - [§ scoping](Scala%203.md#scoping): scope creation, lexical scoping, shadowing
- [scope](../../../../general/scope%20(computer%20science).md) ::@:: It of a name binding \(an association of a name to an entity, such as a variable\) is the part of a program where the name binding is valid; that is, where the name can be used to refer to the entity.
  - scope / motivation ::@:: It helps to avoid _namespace pollution_.
  - scope / lexical scoping ::@:: With it, a name always refers to its lexical context. This is a property of the program text and is made independent of the runtime call stack by the language implementation.

- topic: tail recursion
- rewriting
  - rewriting / substitution model
    - rewriting / substitution model / notation ::@:: The following notation expresses _replacing_ all occurrences of $x_i$ by $v_i$ \(or $v_i$ _substitutes_ $x_i$\) in the expression $E$: $$[v_1 / x_1, \ldots, v_n / x_n] E \,.$$
- [tail call](../../../../general/tail%20call.md) ::@:: It is a subroutine call performed as the final action of a procedure.
  - tail call / tail recursion ::@:: If the target of a tail is the same subroutine, the subroutine is said to be __tail recursive__, which is a special case of direct recursion. __Tail recursion__ \(or __tail-end recursion__\) is particularly useful, and is often easy to optimize in implementations.
    - tail call / tail recursion / substitution model ::@:: Assume _no side effects_. Under the substitution model, a tail-recursive function, when it calls itself, the expression _only contains_ a function call to itself. No matter how many times recursion occurs, the expression "_size_" will not explode.
  - tail call / tail-call elimination ::@:: Tail calls can be implemented without adding a new stack frame to the call stack. Most of the frame of the current procedure is no longer needed, and can be replaced by the frame of the tail call, modified as appropriate \(similar to overlay for processes, but for function calls\). The program can then jump to the called subroutine. Producing such code instead of a standard call sequence is called __tail-call elimination__ or __tail-call optimization__.
    - tail call / tail-call elimination / Scala 3 ::@:: In a function, only tail calls to itself are _optimized_. To ensure this is the case \(or emit a compiler error otherwise\), use the _annotation_ `@scala.annotation.tailrec`.
- Scala
  - Scala / Scala 3
    - [§ tail recursion](Scala%203.md#tail%20recursion): tail recursion
- [higher-order function](../../../../general/higher-order%20function.md) \(HOL\) ::@:: It is a function that does at least one of the following: <p> - takes one or more functions as arguments \(i.e. a procedural parameter, which is a parameter of a procedure that is itself a procedure\), <br/> - returns a function as its result.
  - higher-order function / functional language ::@:: Functional language treat functions as first-class citizens. They are treated as with other primitive types. It provides a flexible way to _compose_ programs.
- Scala
  - Scala / 3
    - [§ function types](Scala%203.md#function%20types): function types, no arguments
    - [§ anonymous functions](Scala%203.md#anonymous%20functions): anonymous functions, syntactic sugar
    - [§ multiple parameter lists](Scala%203.md#multiple%20parameter%20lists): multiple parameter lists, function application, currying
    - [§ function types](Scala%203.md#function%20types): currying
- [currying](../../../../general/currying.md) ::@:: It is the technique of translating a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of families of functions, each taking a single argument.
- higher-order function
  - higher-order function / examples ::@:: - `fold`/`reduce`: It is a higher-order function that analyzes a recursive data structure and through use of a given combining operation, recombines the results of recursively processing its constituent parts, building up a return value. <br/> - `map`: It is a higher-order function that applies a given function to each element of a collection, e.g. a list or set, returning the results in a collection of the same type. <br/> - `mapReduce`: `map` then `reduce`.
- [fixed point](../../../../general/fixed%20point.md) ::@:: It is a value that does not change under a given transformation. Specifically, for functions, a fixed point is an element that is mapped to itself by the function.
- [fixed-point iteration](../../../../general/fixed-point%20iteration.md) ::@:: It is a method of computing fixed points of a function. <p> More specifically, given a function $f$ defined on the [real numbers](../../../../general/real%20number.md) with real values and given a point $x_{0}$ in the [domain](../../../../general/domain%20of%20a%20function.md) of $f$, the fixed-point iteration is $$x_{n+1}=f(x_{n}),\,n=0,1,2,\dots$$ which gives rise to the [sequence](../../../../general/sequence.md) $x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},\dots$ of [iterated function](../../../../general/iterated%20function.md) applications $x_{0},f(x_{0}),f(f(x_{0})),\dots$ which is hoped to [converge](../../../../general/limit%20(mathematics).md) to a point $x_{\text{fix} }$.
  - fixed-point iteration / continuous function ::@:: If $f$ is continuous, then one can prove that the obtained $x_{\text{fix} }$ is a fixed point of $f$, i.e., $$f(x_{\text{fix} })=x_{\text{fix} }.$$ <p> More generally, the function $f$ can be defined on any [metric space](../../../../general/metric%20space.md) with values in that same space.
  - fixed-point iteration / square root ::@:: - A first simple and useful example is the [Babylonian method](../../../../general/Babylonian%20method.md#Heron's%20method) for computing the [square root](../../../../general/square%20root.md) of _a_ \> 0, which consists in taking $f(x)={\frac {1}{2} }\left({\frac {a}{x} }+x\right)$, i.e. the mean value of _x_ and _a_<!-- markdown separator -->/<!-- markdown separator -->_x_, to approach the limit $x={\sqrt {a} }$ \(from whatever starting point $x_{0}\gg 0$\). This is a special case of [Newton's method](../../../../general/Newton's%20method.md) quoted below.
- [extended Backus–Naur form](../../../../general/extended%20Backus–Naur%20form.md) \(EBNF\) ::@:: It is a family of metasyntax notations, any of which can be used to express a context-free grammar. EBNF is used to make a formal description of a formal language such as a computer programming language. They are extensions of the basic Backus–Naur form \(BNF\) metasyntax notation.
  - extended Backus–Naur form / basic syntax ::@:: definition: `<name> = <expr>` <br/> literal: `'<string>'` <br/> alternative \(choose one\): `<left expr> | <right expr>`  <br/> optional \(0 or 1 occurrence\): `[<expr>]` <br/> repetition \(0 or more occurrences\): `{<expr>}` <p> \(__this course__: Try to express Scala syntax in EBNF using the above elements only.\)
- Scala
  - Scala / Scala 3
    - [§ classes](Scala%203.md#classes): classes, constructor, members, abstraction, construction, `this`
    - [§ pre-definitions](Scala%203.md#pre-definitions): pre-definition
    - [§ checking](Scala%203.md#checking): precondition, assertion
    - [§ classes](Scala%203.md#classes): auxiliary constructor
    - [§ scoping](Scala%203.md#scoping): end marker
- rewriting
  - rewriting / substitution model
    - rewriting / substitution model / class ::@:: Assume _no side effects_. For the Scala 3 expression `C(x_1, ..., x_n).f(y_1, ..., y_m)`, it is rewritten to: $$[x_1/C_1, \ldots, x_n/C_n] [y_1/f_1, \ldots, y_m/f_m] [C(x_1, \ldots, x_n)/\text{this}] E \,.$$ That is, we replace `this` with the object _expression_, then replace function arguments, and finally replace class arguments. \(__this course__: Use this model. And we do the above 3 substitutions simultaneously.\) <p> Actually, the above model is not the best, since it does not handle constructors with side effects. A better model would evaluate `this = C(x_1, ..., x_n)`, then define `this.f` to extract the body expression of `f`, and finally evaluate `this.f(y_1, ..., y_m)` by substitution `this` in the body and the function arguments.
- Scala
  - Scala / Scala 3
    - [§ extension methods](Scala%203.md#extension%20methods): extension methods
- rewriting
  - rewriting / substitution model
    - rewriting / substitution model / class ::@:: Assume _no side effects_. For the Scala 3 expression `c.f(y_1, ..., y_m)` where `r` is the name used by the extension definition, it is rewritten to: $$[c/r] [y_1/f_1, \ldots, y_m/f_m] E \,.$$ That is, we replace function arguments, and then replace the name `r` used by the extension definition. \(__this course__: Use this model. And we do the above 2 substitutions simultaneously.\)
- Scala
  - Scala / Scala 3
    - [§ syntax](Scala%203.md#syntax): syntax
    - [§ identifiers](Scala%203.md#identifiers): identifier

## week 2 lab

- datetime: 2025-09-08T15:00:00+08:00/2025-09-08T16:20:00+08:00, PT1H20M
- topic: tools; lab 0; project structure; sbt; IDE; REPL; worksheet; coding
- COMP 3031
  - COMP 3031 / tools ::@:: Coursier \(<https://get-coursier.io>\): Java Development Kit \(JDK\), simple build tool \(sbt\) <br/> Visual Studio Code, extensions: Scala \(Metals\)
  - COMP 3031 / lab 0
    - COMP 3031 / lab 0 / project structure ::@:: Download the skeleton project from Canvas; after extraction you'll see a standard sbt layout. All files ending in `.sbt` or inside `project/` are configuration; modify only the Scala source and test files.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 0 / sbt ::@:: Start the build tool with `sbt`. Compile your code with `compile`; run all tests with `test`, which will automatically compile if needed. If compilation fails, no tests run – address compiler errors first. The first test run usually fails intentionally; read the stack trace to locate the failing line in your source.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 0 / navigation ::@:: When a test throws `NotImplementedError`, locate the call site via the stack trace (`Lists.scala:25` for example). Hover over the method name in the editor to see its signature and documentation. Use "Go to Definition" (Ctrl/Cmd‑click or right‑click) to jump straight to the offending implementation. Replace placeholder `???` with a proper algorithm before re‑running tests.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 0 / IDE tips ::@:: - New lines are auto‑indented; manual indentation uses Tab/Shift‑Tab. <br/> - Do not rename existing methods or classes, as automated grading relies on their names. <br/> - View compiler warnings/errors by clicking the "Problems" pane in VS Code. <br/> - Documentation for Scala \(<https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/>\) and Java \(<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/index.html>\) is available online if IDE hover support falls short.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 0 / test ::@:: In a terminal inside the project, start sbt and then run `~test` to enable watch mode; every file save automatically re‑runs tests. For targeted testing use `testOnly`, e.g. `testOnly org.example.*Slow org.example.MyTest1`.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 0 / REPL ::@:: Launch the REPL with `console` from sbt (`scala>` prompt). <p> Evaluate expressions directly, e.g., `List(3,7,2)` or import lab methods: `import lab0.Lists.*`. Exit the REPL back to sbt with `Ctrl+D`. <p> For multiline input use Alt+Enter (or Option+Enter on macOS after setting "Use Option as Meta key" in Terminal preferences).
    - COMP 3031 / lab 0 / worksheet ::@:: Create a file ending in `.worksheet.sc`; each line is executed automatically and its result shown as a comment. Save the file to trigger re‑evaluation; auto‑save is enabled by default.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 0 / troubleshooting ::@:: - If sbt fails, run `sbt clean cleanFile` or delete the global cache (`rm -r ~/.sbt`). <br/> - If IDE features like hover or go‑to‑definition are broken, manually import the build via the "m" icon → "Import build", then restart VS Code. <br/> - Address Bloop server warnings by following the on‑screen prompts ("Turn off old server").
    - COMP 3031 / lab 0 / coding ::@:: - `Lists.scala` implements two tail‑recursive functions: <br/> &emsp; - `sum(xs: List[Int])`: accumulates list elements, returning `0` for an empty list. <br/> &emsp; - `max(xs: List[Int])`: throws `NoSuchElementException` on an empty list; otherwise returns the maximum value by comparing head with accumulator. <br/> - `ListsSuite.scala` contains sanity checks (e.g., one plus one equals two) and additional tests: <br/> &emsp; - Verifies that `sum(Nil)` yields `0`. <br/> &emsp; - Confirms that calling `max(Nil)` raises the expected exception, using a try‑catch block to fail if no exception occurs.

  - polymorphism / types ::@:: The most commonly recognized major forms of polymorphism are: <p> - _Ad hoc polymorphism_: defines a common interface for an arbitrary set of individually specified types. <br/> - _Parametric polymorphism_: does not specify concrete types and instead uses abstract symbols that can substitute for any type. <br/> - _Subtyping_ (also called _subtype polymorphism_ or _inclusion polymorphism_): when a name denotes instances of many different classes related by a common superclass.
    - polymorphism / types / subtyping ::@:: an instance of a subclass may be used wherever an instance of its superclass is expected, enabling _is‑a_ relationships.
    - polymorphism / types / parametric ::@:: functions or classes are defined with type parameters; concrete instances are created by supplying specific types, allowing the same code to work uniformly across all those types.

- topic: pattern matching; case classes; list; enumeration
- [pattern matching](../../../../general/pattern%20matching.md) ::@:: It is the act of checking a given sequence of tokens for the presence of the constituents of some pattern. In contrast to pattern recognition, the match usually must be exact: "either it will or will not be a match." The patterns generally have the form of either sequences or tree structures.
  - pattern matching / motivation ::@:: representation → manual dispatch → manual dispatch with type tests and casts → dynamic dispatch → non-local or complex operations → pattern matching → summary
    - pattern matching / motivation / representation ::@:: Objects, and in this example, expressions are often modelled as a base type (`Expr`) with concrete subclasses such as `Number` and `Sum`. <p> Each subclass must expose classification (e.g., `isNumber`, `isSum`) and operations (`numValue`, `leftOp`, `rightOp`). Whether an operation is available or throws an runtime error depends on the classification.
    - pattern matching / motivation / manual dispatch ::@:: A evaluation function typically uses conditional checks on the classification flags. <p> Adding a new expression form (like `Prod` or `Var`) forces updates to all methods in the base type, leading to repetitive boilerplate. There is no compile‑time guarantee that the correct accessor is used for each subclass; an accidental misuse can trigger runtime errors.
    - pattern matching / motivation / manual dispatch with type tests and casts ::@:: Languages such as Scala provide `isInstanceOf[T]` and `asInstanceOf[T]`, analogous to Java's `instanceof` and casting syntax (`(T) x`). <p> This approach is verbose, error‑prone, and still offers no static type safety. The type tests and casts are effectively the classification methods.
    - pattern matching / motivation / dynamic dispatch ::@:: Move the operation (`eval`) into each subclass: `def eval: Int` implemented by `Number`, `Sum`, etc. <p> This encapsulates data with its behaviour, enabling straightforward addition of new data forms. However, operations become tightly coupled to the hierarchy; adding a new operation (e.g., pretty‑printing) requires touching every subclass, increasing maintenance burden and class dependencies.
    - pattern matching / motivation / non-local or complex operations ::@:: Operations that need to inspect or modify multiple parts of the structure (e.g., algebraic simplification `a*b + a*c → a*(b+c)`) cannot be expressed as a method on a single node \(object\). The OO decomposition approach \(dynamic dispatch\) then collapses back into the same pattern‑matching or type‑testing problem, negating its benefits.
    - pattern matching / motivation / pattern matching ::@:: Many modern languages provide a dedicated construct for deconstructing algebraic data types (e.g., Scala's `match`, Haskell's case expressions). It cleanly separates the structure of the data from the operations performed on it, enabling new operations without modifying existing classes.
    - pattern matching / motivation / summary ::@:: Class hierarchies are natural for modelling algebraic structures but bring maintenance challenges when the set of constructors or operations changes frequently. <p> Relying on manual dispatch or type casts is brittle; better to use language features that treat data and behaviour as separate concerns (e.g., pattern matching, visitor patterns). <p> The choice between OO decomposition and a more functional style depends on whether operations are local to single objects or require global knowledge of the structure.

- pattern matching
  - pattern matching / functional languages ::@:: __Functional languages__ (OCaml, Haskell) express algebraic data types with minimal syntax: <p> - OCaml: `type expr = Number of int | Sum of expr * expr` and a recursive `eval` using `match`. <br/> - Haskell: `data Expr = Number Int | Sum Expr Expr` with pattern‑matching function definitions.
    - pattern matching / functional languages / Scala ::@:: These ADTs are typically more concise than Scala's, thanks to stronger type inference and lighter syntax. However, Scala's class hierarchies can be richer, supporting: <p> - Methods or fields in both base and derived classes. <br/> - Multi‑level sealed trait inheritance (e.g., `EitherOrBoth`, `Either`). <br/> - Open‑ended (non‑sealed) hierarchies. <br/> - Existential types resembling Generalised ADTs.
  - pattern matching / imperative languages ::@:: They implement ADTs with tagged unions or discriminated unions: <p> - C: `typedef enum { NUMBER, SUM } ExprKind;` and a struct containing a union of concrete representations. The `eval` function uses a `switch` on the kind tag. <br/> - The pattern is verbose and prone to unsafe bugs (e.g., forgetting a case).
  - pattern matching / popularity ::@:: Many languages now provide pattern matching over sealed class hierarchies, including Kotlin, Swift, and newer Java releases. These languages blend the expressiveness of functional ADTs with object‑oriented type systems.

- topic: functional programming
- COMP 3031
  - COMP 3031 / lab 1
    - COMP 3031 / lab 1 / functional programming ::@:: All solutions must avoid state mutation: you cannot use `var`, loops such as `while`, or explicit `return` statements. The Scala collection package `scala.collection.mutable` is forbidden; only immutable collections may be employed.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 1 / Pascal's triangle You are asked to compute the value that appears in a particular column `c` (0‑based) of row `r` in Pascal’s triangle. The triangle is defined such that every entry on its edges equals 1, and each interior entry equals the sum of the two numbers directly above it. Your implementation must be purely recursive—no loops or mutable state are allowed.
      - COMP 3031 / lab 1 / Pascal's triangle / solution ::@:: The function checks whether the requested position lies on an edge (`c == 0` or `c == r`). If so, it returns 1 immediately. Otherwise it recursively evaluates the two parents: `pascal(c-1, r-1)` for the upper‑left value and `pascal(c, r-1)` for the upper‑right value, then returns their sum. This straightforward recursion follows exactly the mathematical definition of Pascal's triangle.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 1 / parentheses balancing ::@:: Given a list of characters representing a string, determine whether all parentheses in the sequence are properly matched and nested. The function must be tail‑recursive, cannot use mutation, and should handle arbitrary other characters by ignoring them.
      - COMP 3031 / lab 1 / parentheses balancing / solution ::@:: An inner helper `rec(chars: List[Char], acc: Int)` processes the list one element at a time while keeping an accumulator that counts unmatched opening brackets. When encountering `'('`, it increments `acc`; for `')'` it decrements; any other character leaves `acc` unchanged. If `acc` ever becomes negative, the function returns false immediately because a closing bracket has no matching opener. When the list ends, the string is balanced only if `acc` equals zero. The outer function simply calls this helper with an initial accumulator of 0.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 1 / counting change ::@:: You must compute how many distinct ways exist to make change for a given amount using a provided list of coin denominations (each denomination can be used unlimited times). The algorithm should be recursive and handle edge cases such as zero amount or an empty coin set.
      - COMP 3031 / lab 1 / counting change / solution ::@:: The function first deals with base cases: if the target money is negative, return 0; if it equals zero, there is exactly one way (use no coins). If the list of coins is empty while the amount remains positive, return 0. For a non‑empty list, let `coin` be the head and `tail` the remainder. The total number of ways is the sum of two recursive calls: one that includes at least one `coin` (`countChange(money - coin, coins)`) and another that excludes it entirely (`countChange(money, tail)`). This recurrence explores all combinations systematically without duplication.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 1 / tips ::@:: - Use the immutable List operations (`isEmpty`, `head`, `tail`) to navigate lists instead of indices. <br/> - Think carefully about degenerate cases (zero amount, empty coin set) to avoid infinite recursion or incorrect counts. <br/> - For tail‑recursion, annotate the helper with `@tailrec` to ensure the compiler verifies termination and stack safety.

- topic: higher-order functions; characteristic function
- COMP 3031
  - COMP 3031 / lab 2 ::@:: In this lab, sets of integers are modeled as _characteristic functions_: a value is in the set iff the function returns `true` for that integer. In code this is expressed with a type alias `FunSet = Int => Boolean`, allowing any set to be represented by a simple predicate.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 2 / `contains` ::@:: A helper called `contains(s: FunSet, elem: Int): Boolean = s(elem)` lets us query membership without exposing the underlying function.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 2 / `singletonSet` ::@:: _Singleton construction_ (`singletonSet`) takes one integer and returns a set that contains exactly that element; implemented as `_ == elem`.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 2 / `union` ::@:: `union(s, t)` yields a set where an integer belongs if it is in either `s` or `t`: `x => contains(s, x) || contains(t, x)`
    - COMP 3031 / lab 2 / `intersect` ::@:: `intersect(s, t)` returns a set of integers belonging to both: `x => contains(s, x) && contains(t, x)`
    - COMP 3031 / lab 2 / `diff` ::@:: `diff(s, t)` produces the set of elements that are in `s` but not in `t`: `x => contains(s, x) && !contains(t, x)`
    - COMP 3031 / lab 2 / `filter` ::@:: The `filter` function selects those members of a given set that also satisfy an arbitrary predicate `p`. Its implementation is a simple logical conjunction: `x => contains(s, x) && p(x)`, returning a new characteristic function.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 2 / `forall` ::@:: Since we cannot enumerate all integers in a purely functional representation, the lab limits attention to the range `[-bound, bound]` (with `bound = 1000`). <p> The `forall(s, p)` routine checks whether every element of `s` satisfies predicate `p`. It uses a tail‑recursive helper `iter(a)` that walks from `-bound` up to `bound`, stopping early if it finds an element in `s` that fails `p`.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 2 / `exists` ::@:: From this universal quantifier, the _existential_ test is derived simply by negation: `exists(s, p) = !forall(s, !p(_))`.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 2 / `map` ::@:: The `map` operation constructs a new set by applying a function `f` to each element of the original set. <p> Because we can only query membership via `contains`, the map is defined as: `x => exists(s, y => f(y) == x)`. For any candidate `x`, it checks whether there exists some `y` in the source set whose image under `f` equals `x`.
    - COMP 3031 / lab 2 / remarks ::@:: All functions can be expressed as one‑liners; the challenge lies in reasoning about function composition rather than writing boilerplate. <p> Think of a set not as a collection but as a _predicate_ that tells whether a given integer is included.
