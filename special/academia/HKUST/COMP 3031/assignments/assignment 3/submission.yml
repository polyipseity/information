    The goal of this assignment is to extend the Scheme-- interpreter from the lecture\
    \ to include more features, namely class-based pattern matching and call-by-need\
    \ evaluation.\nThe skeleton code is essentially the same as the implementation\
    \ presented in the lecture. You are free to modify any of the files in src/main/scala/ass3 except Lisp.scala and InterpreterInterface.scala.\n\
    Class declarations\n\n\nThe first step is to interpret class declarations and\
    \ store the appropriate information in the tydefs environment. Class declarations\
    \ are expressions in the following special form:\n(class (<name> { <field> })\
    \ <rest>)\n\n\n\nwhere { } denotes zero or more repetitions. <rest> is evaluated\
    \ in an environment extended with the declaration of the class <name> with fields {\
    \ <field> }, which can be used for object construction, field selection, and pattern\
    \ matching.\nTo distinguish class names <name>, field names <field>, and variable\
    \ names <param>, we restrict class names to begin with an upper-case alphabet;\
    \ and field names and variable names to begin with a lower-case alphabet. When\
    \ a class, variable, or pattern violating these restrictions is declared, a SyntaxError should\
    \ be thrown. You can use the paramName, fieldName, and className helpers to convert\
    \ symbols to strings while checking for the case restrictions.\nThe information\
    \ stored in the tydefs environment is not examined. You are free to decide what\
    \ to store.\nObject construction\n\n\nAn object of a class can be constructed\
    \ by applying the constructor to a sequence of arguments. For example, the following\
    \ constructs an object of class Pair with the values 1 and 2 for fields x and y respectively:\n\
    (class (Pair x y) (Pair 1 2))\n\n\n\nThe number of arguments applied to the constructor\
    \ must match exactly the arity of the class declaration. Otherwise, a ClassArityMismatch with\
    \ the message \"wrong arity for class <name>\" is thrown, where <name> is the\
    \ class name. Just like functions, constructors cannot be partially applied. For\
    \ example, both of the following result in an error:\n(class (Pair x y) (Pair\
    \ 1))\n(class (Pair x y) (Pair 1 2 3))\n\n\n\nThe behavior of evaluating an unapplied\
    \ constructor is unspecified. For example, the behavior of the following program\
    \ is unspecified:\n(class (Pair x y) Pair)\n\n\n\nTo implement object construction,\
    \ you may want to define additional syntax forms.\nField selection\n\n\nFields\
    \ of an object can be accessed using the field selection special form:\n(sel <expr>\
    \ <field>)\n\n\n\n<expr> is first evaluated. If <expr> evaluates to an object o of\
    \ class C, and (1) C has field <field>, then the whole expression evaluates to\
    \ the value of the field <field> of o; (2) C does not have field <field>, then\
    \ a FieldError with message \"class C has no field <field>\" is thrown. If <expr> evaluates\
    \ to something other than an object, then a SelError with the message \"selection\
    \ from a non-object: o\" is thrown.\nPattern matching\n\n\nThe class of an object\
    \ can be inspected at runtime using pattern matching, with the following special\
    \ form:\n(case <scrut> { <branch> })\n\n\n\nwhere case branches <branch> are one\
    \ of the following.\n<branch> =   ((<name> { <param> }) <expr>)\n           |\
    \ (<param> <expr>)\n\n\n\n<scrut> is first evaluated to v, then matched against {\
    \ <branch> } in order. If a branch is matched, then that branch is taken. The\
    \ remaining branches would not be processed. If a branch is not matched, then\
    \ pattern matching proceeds to the next branch. If all branches are not matched\
    \ or v is not an object, then a MatchError with the message \"match error on:\
    \ <scrut>\" is thrown.\nIf a branch is in the first form ((<name> { <param> })\
    \ <expr>), then the class definition of class <name> is looked up. The size of {\
    \ <param> } must match exactly the arity of class <name>, otherwise a ClassArityMismatch with\
    \ the message \"wrong arity for class <name>\" is thrown. If v is an object of\
    \ class <name>, then the branch is matched, and <expr> is evaluated in an environment\
    \ extended by binding each of { <param> } to the respective fields of v. For example,\
    \ in the following expression, <expr> is evaluated in an environment extended\
    \ with bindings a -> 1 and b -> 2:\n(class (Pair x y) (case (Pair 1 2) ((Pair\
    \ a b) <expr>)))\n\n\n\nIf a branch is in the second form (<param> <expr>), then\
    \ it is always matched. <expr> is evaluated in an environment extended by binding <param> to v.\
    \ For example, in the following expression, <expr> is evaluated in an environment\
    \ extended with binding x -> Pair 1 2:\n(class (Pair x y) (case (Pair 1 2) (x\
    \ <expr>)))\n\n\n\nIf a branch does not match either form, then a SyntaxError with\
    \ the message \"invalid case branch: <branch>\" is thrown.\nCall-by-need\n\n\n\
    The final part of the assignment is to implement the call-by-need evaluation strategy,\
    \ for val bindings, function arguments, and constructor arguments. Call-by-need\
    \ is similar to call-by-name, where the arguments are not evaluated until their\
    \ value is accessed. However, unlike call-by-name, the arguments are only evaluated\
    \ once, after which the result is stored for further access.\nFor val bindings,\
    \ they are accessed only when the bound variable is evaluated inside the body.\
    \ For example, in the following program, the expression <expr> is never evaluated:\n\
    (val x <expr> 0)\n\n\n\nIn the following program, the expression <expr> is only\
    \ evaluated once:\n(val x <expr> (* x x))\n\n\n\nFor function arguments, they\
    \ are accessed only when the corresponding parameter is evaluated inside the function\
    \ body. For example, in the following program, the expressions (id <expr>) and <expr> are\
    \ never evaluated:\n(def id (lambda (x) x) (def zero (lambda (x) 0) (zero (id\
    \ <expr>))))\n\n\n\nIn the following program, the expressions (sq (sq <expr>)), (sq\
    \ <expr>), and <expr> are each only evaluated once:\n(def sq (lambda (x) (* x\
    \ x)) (sq (sq (sq <expr>))))\n\n\n\nFor constructor arguments, they are accessed\
    \ only when a selection is evaluated, or when a variable bound by pattern matching\
    \ is evaluated. Namely, constructing an object does not evaluate any of the arguments.\
    \ For example, in the following programs, the expressions <expr1> and <expr2> are\
    \ never evaluated:\n(class (Pair x y) (def zero (lambda (x) 0) (val x (Pair <expr1>\
    \ <expr2>) (zero (sel x x)))))\n(class (Pair x y) (def zero (lambda (x) 0) (case\
    \ (Pair <expr1> <expr2>) ((Pair a b) (zero a)))))\n\n\n\nIn the following programs,\
    \ the expression <expr1> is evaluated once, while <expr2> is never evaluated:\n\
    (class (Pair x y) (val x (Pair <expr1> <expr2>) (* (sel x x) (sel x x))))\n(class\
    \ (Pair x y) (case (Pair <expr1> <expr2>) ((Pair a b) (* a a))))\n\n\n\nTo implement\
    \ call-by-need, you may define a wrapper around arguments. You may also want to\
    \ wrap arguments in these wrappers before applying a function or constructor to\
    \ them, change what the interpreter does when it encounters these wrappers, and\
    \ change the builtin functions to take these wrappers.\nRestriction\n\n\nYou are\
    \ not allowed to use any mutable collections, or mutable variables referring to\
    \ collections beside Option. You are not allowed to modify the files Lisp.scala and InterpreterInterface.scala.\n\
    Submission\n\n\nPlease refer to the Canvas assignment page for the deadline.\n\
    Submit a single zip archive containing the source files. All files will be extracted\
    \ to the src/main/scala/ass3 directory of the skeleton, replacing any existing\
    \ files.\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\nName conflict\nQ: Can we assume there won't be a conflict\
    \ of class names and variable names?\nA: Class names and variable names won't\
    \ conflict with each other since class names begin with upper case and variable\
    \ names begin with lower case. But there may be duplicate class names and variable\
    \ names. The new definition would shadow the old one, but any existing definitions\
    \ would still refer to the original definition. For example, (def f 1 (def g f\
    \ (def f 2 g))) would evaluate to 1, and (class (Pair x y) (val p (Pair 1 2) (class\
    \ (Pair y x) (sel p x)))) would evaluate to 1. There is no way to pattern match\
    \ on a shadowed class but selection should still work as intended.\nYou can assume\
    \ that field names within a class declaration are distinct. Duplicate field names\
    \ won't be tested, so you can return any one of them, or throw an exception when\
    \ you encounter such declarations.\n\n\n\n\nClass declaration scope\nQ: What would\
    \ happen when an object is returned outside the scope of its class declaration?\
    \ For example (sel (class (Pair x y) (Pair 1 2)) x).\nA: You can assume class\
    \ declarations are properly scoped, i.e. the class definition would be visible\
    \ at any selection or pattern matching. So only (class (Pair x y) (sel (Pair 1\
    \ 2) x)) would be tested. (On the other hand, it is also fine to handle this case,\
    \ it just won't be tested.)\n\n\n\n\nObject value\nQ: What should an object evaluate\
    \ to? For example (class (Pair x y) (Pair 1 2)).\nA: It should evaluate to your\
    \ internal representation of objects. Since it would be added by you, this will\
    \ not really be tested. But namely it should not be equal to representations of\
    \ other values, such as integers, strings, Lambdas, etc. Otherwise it can be used\
    \ as other types.\n\n\n\n\nCall-by-need evaluation\nQ: Can you give an example\
    \ to demonstrate how call-by-need works?\nA: Consider the following example:\n\
    (def sq1 (lambda (x) (* x x)) (def sq2 (lambda (y) (sq1 y)) (sq2 <expr>)))\n\n\
    \n\nThe body of sq2 ((sq1 y)) would be evaluated in an environment with <expr> bound\
    \ to y (env1), then the body of sq1 ((* x x)) would be evaluated in an environment\
    \ with y bound to x (env2). When the multiplication is evaluated, the two operands\
    \ are evaluated first. When the first operand x is evaluated, it is looked up\
    \ from env2 and the expression (y) is evaluated in env1, then y is looked up from env1 and\
    \ the expression (<expr>) is evaluated in the original environment. When the second\
    \ operand x is evaluated, the result from the last evaluation is used instead\
    \ of evaluating it again. Finally the multiplication evaluates to the product\
    \ of the result of evaluating the two operands.\n\n\n\n\nForcing evaluation\n\
    Q: When exactly is an evaluation performed under call-by-need?\nA: (1) Evaluating\
    \ a variable, and (2) applying a variable to the built-in functions. Arguments\
    \ to all built-in functions are evaluated."
