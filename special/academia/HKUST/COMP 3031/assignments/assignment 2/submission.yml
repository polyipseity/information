    In this assignment, you will implement a Tic-Tac-Toe game and. The project is
    divided into three parts: tic-tac-toe game, minimax algorithm, and alpha-beta
    pruning. Each part builds upon the previous one, so it is important to complete
    them in order. Download the skeleton project here

    Part 1: Tic-Tac-Toe



    Tic-tac-toe





    Links to an external site. (or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players
    who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player
    who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
    row is the winner.

    In this part, you will implement the core game logic for Tic-Tac-Toe. To be more
    specific, you need to:



    Implement the Board class in Board.scala. This class represents the game board
    and includes methods to:


    Check if the board is full with isFull.



    Access and update cells with apply.



    Update the board with update.



    Create a new board with empty.






    You MUST NOT change the parameters of Board class because we will access the underlying Vector in
    the tests. If you make any changes to them, the tests might fail.





    Implement the Game in TicTacToe.scala. This class defines the game logic of tic-tac-toe,
    including methods to:


    Get the initial state with initialState.



    Determine the next player with nextPlayer.



    List possible moves with possibleMoves.



    Check if a move is valid with isValidMove.



    Check if the move can be made in the current state with canMove.



    Make a move with makeMove.



    Check if the game is over with gameOver.



    Evaluate the game state evaluate.



    Get the winner with winner.






    You can read the definition of Game to gain more insight.







    Notes




    Board's toString method is implemented for you. You can use it to visualize the
    game board.



    We always start with player Max (X) and player Min (O) alternates.



    The game is over when one player wins or the board is full.






    Hints





    Most functions can be implemented in a single line. The remaining functions can
    be implemented in a few lines.





    The implementation of evaluate is various and heuristic. There is not a unique
    way to implement it. The most straightforward way is to check all possible lines,
    and


    if player Max wins, return 1;



    if player Min wins, return -1; or



    if the game is a draw, return 0.






    You can also explore other heuristic ways to implement it.







    Part 2: Minimax Algorithm



    The minimax





    Links to an external site. algorithm is an algorithm for finding the best move
    in a two-player game. The algorithm first builds a game tree. Leaf nodes present
    game states where the game is over, while internal nodes present game states where
    the game is in progress.

    In this part, you will implement the minimax algorithm to find the best move for
    the current player. Your main task is to implement the bestMove method, which
    should recursively evaluate the game tree to find the best move for the current
    player:


    if the game is over, return None;



    if the current player is Max, choose the best move (with the highest score); or



    if the current player is Min, choose the best move (with the lowest score).






    Notes




    We provide an interactive command-line tic-tac-toe shell in play.scala for you
    to quickly test your implementation. You can run run in the sbt console to start
    the game. Make sure you have finished the first part before running the game.



    If you haven't heard of this algorithm, don't be afraid, it's simple. Basically,
    it traverses the tree and calculates the maximum/minimum value in different plies.
    Read the Wikipedia page (especially the Pseudocode section





    Links to an external site.) or other tutorials and implement it in a functional
    programming manner.



    Your implementation should go through every node in the game tree without setting
    a depth limit. Since the algorithm traverses the entire game tree to find the
    best move, the laziness of LazyList is not utilized. It is fine to be inefficient
    in this part.






    Part 3: Alpha-Beta Pruning



    We have implemented the minimax algorithm, which basically explores the entire
    game tree to find the best move. In this part, you will implement the alpha-beta
    pruning





    Links to an external site. algorithm to optimize the minimax algorithm.

    You should implement the bestMove method of the AlphaBeta given instance. This
    method should recursively and selectively explore the game tree using alpha-beta
    pruning to find the best move for the current player.


    if the game is over, return None;



    if the current player is Max, use Alpha-Beta pruning to choose the move with the
    highest evaluation; or



    if the current player is Min, use Alpha-Beta pruning to choose the move with the
    lowest evaluation.






    Notes




    You should make use of the laziness of LazyList to prune unnecessary branches
    in the game tree.



    Read the Wikipedia or other tutorials to understand the algorithm. It's not difficult
    once you have learned how to implement the minimax algorithm.






    Tests



    The skeleton project includes a small set of tests for each part to help you verify
    your implementation. You can run the tests using the test command in the sbt console.
    These tests only cover the basic functionality of your implementation. We will
    evaluate your submission with additional test cases.

    To be more specific, we will check:


    that you have visited every node in the game tree in the minimax algorithm;



    that you have pruned unnecessary branches in the alpha-beta pruning algorithm
    by checking the number of nodes created;



    that your implementation should be able to draw on tic-tac-toe with our implementation;
    and



    the effectiveness of your implementation of alpha-beta pruning on a larger tic-tac-toe-like
    game (technically speaking, a m,n,k-game





    Links to an external site. with slightly larger m, n, and k). Your implementation
    is not required to win every game, but it should be able to place a mark to block
    the opponent from forming a line, which is a very basic requirement for a game
    search algorithm.
