Calculate the _probability of 10 or more products being defective in a random sample of 100 products_: $$\begin{aligned} P(\text{defective} \ge 3) & = 1 - P(\text{defective} < 3) \\ & = 1 - \sum_{k = 0}^2 P(\text{defective} = k) \\ & = 1 - \sum_{k = 0}^2 \binom {100} k (0.01)^k (0.99)^{100 - k} \\ & \approx 0.0794 \end{aligned}$$.

  - data / reading a table ::@:: Data are commonly listed in a table. Each column is a characteristic which we called a _variable_. Each row (except for the header) is a datum which we called an _observation_. <!--SR:!2026-03-03,410,310!2028-04-28,1038,350-->
  - data / types of variables ::@:: _categorical/qualitative_: distinct categories or labels, and can be subdivided into _nominal_ if the categories cannot be ranked or _ordinal_ if they can be ranked; _quantitative_: numerical, and can be subdivided into _continuous_ if it arises from measurement or _discrete_ if it arises from counting <!--SR:!2026-11-04,546,310!2028-06-10,1072,350-->

Then its _sample median_ is $$\tilde x = \frac 1 2 \left(x_{\lfloor \frac {x + 1} 2 \rfloor} + x_ {\lceil \frac {x + 1} 2 \rceil} \right) = \begin{cases} x_{\frac {n + 1} 2} & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\ \frac 1 2 \left(x_{\frac x 2} + x_{\frac x 2 + 1} \right) & \text{if }n\text{ is even} \end{cases}$$. <!--SR:!2027-03-27,704,330!2027-10-17,817,330-->
  - sample mean vs sample median ::@:: The former is sensitive to outliers while the latter is not. This motivates trimming the outliers of the observations before calculating the former to reduce its sensitiveness to outliers (while still being more sensitive than the latter). <!--SR:!2027-04-25,732,330!2028-04-02,1014,350-->
    - sample mean vs sample median / details ::@:: The former is used if the distribution is symmetric, unimodal and there are no outliers. Otherwise the latter is usually better. <!--SR:!2028-11-05,1188,350!2027-05-19,742,330-->

- [descriptive statistics](../../../../general/descriptive%20statistics.md)
  - sample [variance](../../../../general/variance.md) ::@:: Suppose we have $n$ _samples_ (with replacement) of a random variable $x$, labeled $x_1, \ldots, x_n$. Then its _unbiased sample variance_ is $$s^2_{n - 1} = \frac 1 {n - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar x)^2$$. The _biased sample variance_, denoted $s^2_n$, replaces the factor $\frac 1 {n - 1}$ with $\frac 1 n$ in the above equation. \(__this course__: Unless otherwise specified, the unbiased sample variance is used in this course.\) <!--SR:!2028-10-24,1178,350!2029-01-14,1242,350-->
    - sample [variance](../../../../general/variance.md) / dividing by $n - 1$ ::@:: $n - 1$ is also the _degree of freedom associated with the variance estimate_, which is the number of independent information pieces available for computing variability. Since $\bar x$ is usually the sample mean, which is determined from the sample mean, a degree of freedom is lost, as $\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar x)$ is always forced to be zero. So the degree of freedom is $n - 1$. The original $n$ degrees of freedom comes from the $n$ observations being independent. This explains why dividing $n - 1$ instead of $n$ is _unbiased_. (If the $n$ observations are the entire population, then we divide by $n$ to get the _population variance_ instead.) <!--SR:!2029-03-01,1279,350!2029-05-01,1323,350-->
    - sample [variance](../../../../general/variance.md) / dividing by $n$ ::@:: However, if $\bar x$ is the population mean, then $\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar x)$ is not forced to be zero, so the degree of freedom is still $n$ (from $n$ independent observations) instead. In this case, we divide by $n$ instead of $n - 1$ to get an _unbiased_ (sample/population) variance. This is regardless if the $n$ observations are a sample or the entire population. <!--SR:!2028-01-11,932,330!2028-09-12,1145,350-->
    - sample variance / _R_ ::@:: use `var(...)` <!--SR:!2028-11-09,1191,350!2028-04-23,1033,350-->
  - sample standard deviation ::@:: It is the square root of the sample variance: $$s = \sqrt{s^2} \,.$$ However, no matter if the sample variance is biased or unbiased, the resulting sample standard deviation is biased. This is because the square root is a concave function and introduces additional negative bias \(smaller than the corresponding population parameter\). <!--SR:!2026-06-09,425,290!2027-12-06,893,330-->
    - sample standard deviation / _R_ ::@:: use `sd(...)` <!--SR:!2026-05-05,454,310!2029-07-17,1383,350-->
  - sample range ::@:: It is defined as $$\text{range} = \max\set{x_i} - \min\set{x_i}$$. It is useful for statistical quality control (e.g. finding unusual outliers caused by bad measurement). <!--SR:!2027-07-28,786,330!2028-11-17,1192,350-->
  - inter-quartile range (IQR) ::@:: It is defined as the range of the middle 50% of the data, or equivalently the third (75%) quartile subtracted by the first (25%) quartile: $$\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1 \,.$$ It is also a measure of data dispersion. It can also eliminate problems with outliers. <!--SR:!2028-07-05,1088,350!2028-03-06,917,330-->
    - inter-quartile range / _R_ ::@:: use `IQR(...)`, not `iqr` <!--SR:!2028-11-16,1192,350!2029-05-09,1329,350-->
  - variability / characteristics (common to most or all measures of variability) ::@:: All measures must be nonnegative. Most measures (exceptions: inter-quartile range, trimmed variants of statistics, ...) are zero [iff](../../../../general/if%20and%20only%20if.md) all data are the same (i.e. no spread). <!--SR:!2029-03-13,1284,350!2028-01-14,921,330-->
- [data presentation](../../../../general/data%20and%20information%20visualization.md) ::@:: A graphical summary can communicate information better as people prefers to look at them rather than numbers. The method of presentation depends on the data _nature_ and visualization _goals_. <!--SR:!2027-03-27,717,330!2026-08-18,536,310-->
  - data presentation / quantitative data ::@:: box plot, frequency table, histogram, line chart, scatter plot, ... <!--SR:!2026-05-13,412,290!2026-05-21,462,310-->

  - line chart ::@:: It visualizes the trend of data over time well. Good for time-series data like stock prices. <!--SR:!2028-06-26,1079,350!2028-07-04,1087,350-->
    - line chart / reading ::@:: Start from the x-axis, then to the line, and lastly to the y-axis. <!--SR:!2028-10-24,1179,350!2028-01-11,951,350-->
    - line chart / _R_ ::@:: use `plot(...)` <!--SR:!2029-07-22,1387,350!2028-09-22,1147,350-->
  - frequency table (quantitative) ::@:: Data is grouped into numerically ordered non-overlapping _categories_ or _class intervals_. Then a _summary table_ is drawn based on the grouped data. This condenses the data and allows for quicker data interpretation. <!--SR:!2026-12-31,621,310!2027-08-12,802,330-->
    - frequency table (quantitative) / procedure ::@:: Decide the number of class intervals (usually 5 to 20). Divide the data into that many intervals (usually covering the data range evenly). Adjust the class interval boundaries to avoid overlapping (as endpoints are inclusive). Construct the summary table. <!--SR:!2026-10-17,528,270!2027-02-28,691,330-->
    - frequency table (quantitative) / table headers ::@:: class interval, class midpoint, frequency, relative frequency, ... <!--SR:!2027-09-10,828,330!2027-01-08,586,290-->
  - histogram ::@:: A bar chart based on the frequency table. The x-axis labels the class intervals while the y-axis labels the frequency or density (relative frequency). <!--SR:!2028-01-05,915,330!2029-04-29,1262,310-->
    - histogram / _R_ ::@:: use `hist(...)`, or `histogram(...)` after importing `library(lattice)` (different style) <!--SR:!2028-02-08,968,350!2028-02-25,985,350-->
- [descriptive statistics](../../../../general/descriptive%20statistics.md)
  - modality ::@:: It is the number of peaks (local modes) in the probability distribution. If there are no significant peaks, then it is _uniform_. If there are peaks, it may be _unimodal_ (1), _bimodal_ (2), ...; or _multimodal_ (>1) in general for multiple peaks. <!--SR:!2029-09-18,1433,350!2028-07-14,1097,350-->

    - [multimodal distribution](../../../../general/multimodal%20distribution.md)
  - [skewness](../../../../general/skewness.md) ::@:: Intuitively for graphs, a distribution is __left-skewed__ or __negative-skewed__ if _its tail is on the left_, and vice versa for __right-skewed__ or __positive-skewed__. Otherwise, it is __unskewed__. Intuitively for numbers, a distribution is left-skewed if its mean is on the left of (smaller than) its median, and vice versa for right-skewed. Otherwise, it is unskewed. (But actually, said intuition is very very wrong sometimes... See the item below.) <!--SR:!2027-09-30,789,290!2028-08-19,1073,310-->
    - [skewness § relationship of mean and median](../../../../general/skewness.md#relationship%20of%20mean%20and%20median) ::@:: The above intuition is _usually_ correct if the distribution is unimodal. But in general, there are no direct relationships between skewness, mean, and median. Furthermore, an unskewed distribution is not necessarily symmetric. But its converse, a symmetric distribution is unskewed, is true. <!--SR:!2027-07-01,759,330!2027-04-24,731,330-->
  - percentile, quantile (not quartile) ::@:: percentile, quantile: the number for which a specified portion of the sample or population is _equal to or less than_ (e.g. 90th percentile = 0.90 quantile, which means the number 90% of the sample or population is equal to or less than) <!--SR:!2027-07-29,701,270!2026-09-17,505,270-->

In this case, there are many different ways to define them, and we will use the following equation (this is different from that in HKDSE): $$x(p) = \frac 1 2 \left(x_{\lfloor np + 0.5 \rfloor} + x_{\lceil np + 0.5 \rceil} \right) \qquad p = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75$$. <!--SR:!2027-05-09,739,330!2026-04-14,392,290-->
    - quartile / _R_ ::@:: use `quantile(...)`, not `quartile` (note that the procedure of `quantile` is different from discussed above) <!--SR:!2027-04-25,725,330!2028-02-09,969,350-->
  - extrema ::@:: 0th quartile/minimum (Q0) = 0th percentile/0.00 quantile, 4th quartile/maximum (Q4) = 100th percentile/1.00 quantile <!--SR:!2028-10-01,1156,350!2029-02-01,1256,350-->
- [data presentation](../../../../general/data%20and%20information%20visualization.md)
  - box plot ::@:: A box plot labels the least data that is not an outlier (instead of the value $Q_1 - 1.5 \cdot \text{IQR}$), the lower quartile (Q1), median (Q2), upper quartile (Q3), and the greatest data that is not an outlier (instead of the value $Q_3 + 1.5 \cdot \text{IQR}$) as lines; and outliers as dots (with "min" and "max" labels on 2 of them). Additional lines are added so that the lines of Q1 and Q3 forms a rectangle (box). (See that thing on Canvas grade stats...?) <!--SR:!2026-05-23,416,290!2026-05-31,418,290-->
    - box plot / outliers ::@:: They $x$ are points that are $x \le Q_1 - 1.5 \cdot \text{IQR}$ or $x \ge Q_3 + 1.5 \cdot \text{IQR}$. Usually they are far away from the majority of the data and are _likely_ produced by measurement errors. Assuming a normal distribution, outliers are expected to appear rarely (~0.007). <!--SR:!2028-10-31,1123,310!2026-04-13,391,290-->
    - box plot / _R_ ::@:: use `boxplot(...)` <!--SR:!2028-06-30,1083,350!2029-03-31,1297,350-->

    - sampling / errors / survivorship bias ::@:: (as demonstration, unlikely related in most statistics) A famous example: Many planes were flying through enemy territories. Some survived. Engineers found holes on some parts of the survived planes. So they decided to reinforce those parts. But this did not improve survival rates. The actual best parts to reinforce were those without holes on the survived planes, because this implied the other planes did not survive because of holes in said parts. Hence the name. <!--SR:!2027-04-30,695,330!2026-06-08,480,310-->
    - sampling / errors / selection bias ::@:: A sample of convenience, which probably makes certain subjects more likely than others to be sampled. <!--SR:!2027-06-17,771,330!2027-05-03,741,330-->
    - sampling / errors / non-response bias (participation bias) ::@:: For example, parents are less likely to answer a survey at 6 pm because they are busy with children and dinner. <!--SR:!2027-07-26,782,330!2027-07-21,780,330-->

  - [non-probability sampling](../../../../general/sampling%20(statistics).md#nonprobability%20sampling) ::@:: It supports weaker statistical inferences from a sample to the population.

  - probability / event ::@:: A __probability__ of an uncertain outcome / event is the chance (or likelihood) that it will occur. It must be in between 0 and 1, inclusively. <!--SR:!2026-05-07,452,381!2026-04-23,439,381-->
- random experiment ::@:: A __random experiment__ is a process that generates observations, and its outcome cannot be known beforehand and is only known after its performance. <!--SR:!2026-04-30,445,381!2026-05-02,447,381-->
- sample space ::@:: A __sample space__ is a set of _all_ possible outcomes of a random experiment, often denoted by _S_. Each outcome is called  __sample point__, denoted by _s_. <!--SR:!2026-04-16,434,378!2026-04-22,439,381-->
  - sample space / set-builder notation ::@:: To describe sample spaces for a large or infinite sample points, we can use the set-builder notation (__statement__ or __rule method__). It has the form: $$\set{x \mid P(x)} \,.$$, where _x_ is an indeterminate and _P_(_x_) is a predicate on the indeterminate. An element is in the set iff _P_(_x_) is true. <!--SR:!2026-04-22,439,381!2026-04-03,422,378-->
- event ::@:: An __event__ is any subset of the sample space, often denoted by capital letters. The set of all events is the __event space__. Equivalently, it is the power set of the sample space. <!--SR:!2025-12-06,319,361!2029-09-19,1430,381-->

  - set theory / disjoint ::@:: If two events have no common element, their intersection is an empty set Φ. The events are said to be __disjoint__. If a set of two or more events is __pairwise disjoint__, that is any two events from the set of events are _disjoint_, then the set of events are said to be __mutually exclusive__. <!--SR:!2025-12-05,318,361!2026-04-01,421,378-->
  - set theory / complement ::@:: The __complement__ of an event _A_ is the sample space excluding outcomes in event _A_, denoted $A^\complement, A^c, \overline A, A'$. Intuitively, it is the event that event _A_ does not occur. It is defined as $$A^\complement = \set{s \mid s \in S, s \notin A} \,.$$ Three properties: _S_<sup>c</sup> = Φ and Φ<sup>c</sup> = _S_, and an event and its complement must be _disjoint_. <!--SR:!2029-10-12,1439,378!2026-05-14,458,381-->
  - set theory / difference ::@:: The __difference__ of two events _A_ and _B_ is the event that _A_ occurs but _B_ does not occur, denoted _A_ − _B_. It is defined as: $$A - B = \set{s \mid s \in A \text{ and } s \notin B} = A \cap B^\complement \,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-04-18,436,381!2026-04-11,430,381-->

  - probability axioms / history ::@:: In 1933, a Russian mathematician named Andrei Nikolayevich Kolmogorov published the axiomatic structure of probability theory. <!--SR:!2028-09-30,1111,361!2028-05-19,1005,361-->
  - probability axioms / first axiom ::@:: The first axiom is __non-negativity__. The probability of any event in a sample space is nonnegative. <!--SR:!2026-04-24,441,381!2026-04-21,437,378-->
  - probability axioms / second axiom ::@:: The second axiom is __normalization__. The probability of the event that is the entire sample space is 1. <!--SR:!2026-04-29,445,381!2026-05-13,457,381-->
  - probability axioms / third axiom ::@:: The third axiom is __countable additivity__. For any _countable_ (finite or infinite) sequence of _mutually exclusive_ events, the probability of the union of them is the sum of their probabilities. <p> A set is _countable_ if it is finite or its element can be enumerated (has a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers). For example, the natural numbers are _countable_, while the real numbers or any nonempty intervals of it are not. <!--SR:!2026-04-04,423,378!2029-11-06,1462,381-->
- probability measure ::@:: A __probability measure__, denoted _P_, is a real-valued function that assigns probabilities to events in a sample space. It is a __measure__, a mathematical abstraction of area, volume, probability, etc. <!--SR:!2029-02-14,1253,378!2026-04-24,441,381-->
- probability axioms
  - probability axioms / probability of the empty set ::@:: The probability of the empty set is 0. Proof: $$\begin{aligned} P(\varnothing \cap \varnothing) & = P(\varnothing) + P(\varnothing) && \sigma\text{-additivity} \\ P(\varnothing) & = P(\varnothing) + P(\varnothing) \\ P(\varnothing) & = 0 \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2026-05-01,446,381!2026-05-06,451,381-->
  - probability axioms / finite additivity ::@:: It is just the first axiom limited to finite sequences. Proof: Append an infinite number of empty sets to the finite sequence to make it infinite. Then _countable additivity_ can be applied. <!--SR:!2029-04-17,1307,381!2026-04-30,446,381-->
  - probability axioms / monotonicity ::@:: If _A_ is a subset of _B_ then _P_(_A_) ≤ _P_(_B_). Proof: $$\begin{aligned} P(A) + P(B - A) & = P(B) && A \subseteq B, \sigma\text{-additivity} \\ P(A) & \le P(B) && \text{non-negativity} \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2029-04-25,1314,381!2026-04-27,443,378-->
  - probability axioms / numeric bound ::@:: The probability of any event is in between 0 and 1, inclusive. The lower bound is the non-negativity axiom, while the upper bound can be proved using the normalization axiom, monotonicity theorem, with the larger set being the sample space. <!--SR:!2026-04-07,426,381!2026-05-07,452,381-->
  - probability axioms / complement rule ::@:: The probability of the complement of any event is one minus the probability of that event. Proof: $$P\left(A^\complement \right) = P(S - A) = P(S) - P(A) = 1 - P(A)$$ <!--SR:!2026-04-14,432,381!2026-04-08,427,381-->
  - probability axioms / additive law ::@:: The __additive law__ is: $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \,.$$ When _A_ and _B_ are disjoint, then _P_(_A_ ∩ _B_) is 0 and the above degenerates into the finite additivity theorem. <p> The above is a special case of the [inclusion–exclusion principle](../../../../general/inclusion–exclusion%20principle.md), which can handle any countable number of events: $$\mathbb {P} \left(\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\right)=\sum _{k=1}^{n}\left((-1)^{k-1}\sum _{I\subseteq \{1,\ldots ,n\} \atop |I|=k}\mathbb {P} (A_{I})\right) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-05-15,458,381!2025-12-04,317,361-->

- probability of an event in a sample space with _finite equally likely_ outcomes ::@:: If each outcome in a sample space is _equally likely_, then the probability of an event is the number of outcomes in the event divided by the number of outcomes in the sample space. This can be proved using the sigma-additivity axiom on an event. <!--SR:!2026-04-28,444,381!2029-04-15,1305,381-->

  - [§ rule of sum](../../../../general/combinatorial%20principles.md#rule%20of%20sum) ::@:: The __rule of sum__ is an intuitive principle stating that if there are _a_ possible outcomes for an event (or ways to do something) and _b_ possible outcomes for another event (or ways to do another thing), and the two events cannot both occur (or the two things can't both be done), then there are _a + b_ total possible outcomes for the events (or total possible ways to do one of the things). <!--SR:!2025-12-15,311,361!2026-05-16,459,381-->
  - [§ rule of product](../../../../general/combinatorial%20principles.md#rule%20of%20product) ::@:: The rule of product is another intuitive principle stating that if there are _a_ ways to do something and _b_ ways to do another thing, then there are _a_ · _b_ ways to do both things. <!--SR:!2026-04-25,441,381!2026-05-19,462,381-->
- [permutation](../../../../general/permutation.md) ::@:: The number of ways to order _k_ things from _n_ things is $$P(n, k) = \frac {n!} {(n - k)!} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-05-02,448,381!2026-05-09,453,381-->
  - permutation / circular permutation ::@:: If the ordering is circular, we need to divide the permutation by the size of the circle: $$\frac {P(n, k)} {k} = \frac {n!} {(n - k)! k} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-05-05,450,381!2026-05-08,453,381-->
- [combination](../../../../general/combination.md) ::@:: The number of ways to select _k_ things from _n_ things, where the order of selection does not matter, is $$C(n, k) = \binom n k = \frac {n!} {(n - k)! k!} = \frac {P(n, k)} {k!} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-01-13,336,361!2026-05-04,449,381-->
  - combination / partition ::@:: The number of ways to partition _n_ things into _r_ labelled partitions, where _k_<sub>_i_</sub> is the number of things in the _i_-th partition, is: $${n\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_r} =\frac{n!}{k_1!k_2!\cdots k_r!} \,.$$ When there are only two partitions, this is the same as above, the number of ways to select _k_ things from _n_ things. <!--SR:!2026-04-16,434,381!2026-04-22,438,381-->

- [conditional probability](../../../../general/conditional%20probability.md) ::@:: The __conditional probability__ of an event _A_ given that an event _B_, where _P_(_B_) > 0, has happened is: $$P(A \mid B) = \frac {P(A \cap B)} {P(B)} \,.$$ A property: $P(A \mid B) \ge P(A \cap B)$. <!--SR:!2026-04-26,443,381!2026-03-27,416,378-->
  - conditional probability / motivation ::@:: Knowing an event has happened may modify the probability of other events. Conditional probability can model this. <!--SR:!2029-04-24,1313,381!2025-12-18,314,361-->
  - conditional probability / multiplicative rule ::@:: If _P_(_B_) > 0, then $$P(A \cap B) = P(A \mid B) P(B) \,.$$ This may be directly proved from the definition of conditional probability. Sometimes, the above is taken to be the definition of conditional probability instead (but not in this course). <!--SR:!2026-04-23,440,381!2026-03-28,417,378-->
  - conditional probability / conserved properties ::@:: Many other properties of probability hold under conditional probability. This can be easily seen by making the event that has happened to be the sample space instead. Example: $$\begin{aligned} P(A \mid B) & = 1 - P\left(A^\complement \mid B \right) \\ P(A \cup B \mid C) & = P(A \mid C) + P(B \mid C) - P(A \cap B \mid C) \\ P(A \cap B \mid C) & = P(A \mid B \cap C) P(B \mid C) \,. \end{aligned}$$ For the last example, if you reinterpret _C_ as the sample space, then $P(A \mid B \cap C)$ becomes $P(A \mid B)$. <!--SR:!2026-05-20,463,381!2026-05-20,463,381-->
- [chain rule](../../../../general/chain%20rule%20(probability).md) ::@:: generalization of the _multiplicative rule_ <!--SR:!2025-12-07,320,361!2026-05-12,456,381-->

  - [chain rule § finitely many events](../../../../general/chain%20rule%20(probability).md#finitely%20many%20events) ::@:: $$\begin{aligned} \mathbb P(A_1 \cap \ldots \cap A_n) & = \mathbb P(A_1 \cap \ldots \cap A_{n - 1}) \mathbb P(A_n \mid A_1 \cap \ldots \cap A_{n - 1}) \\ & = \mathbb P(A_1) \mathbb P(A_2 \mid A_1) \ldots \mathbb P(A_n \mid A_1 \cap \ldots \cap A_{n - 1}) \\ & = \prod_{k = 1}^n \mathbb P(A_k \mid A_1 \cap \ldots A_{k - 1}) \\ & = \prod_{k = 1}^n \mathbb P\left(A_k \,\Bigg|\, \bigcap_{j = 1}^{k - 1} A_j \right) \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2026-04-09,428,381!2028-07-17,1052,358-->
- [law of total probability](../../../../general/law%20of%20total%20probability.md#statement) ::@:: If $$\left\{ B_n : n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \right\}$$ is a _finite or countably infinite_ set of _mutually exclusive_ and _collectively exhaustive_ events $$P(A)=\sum_n P(A\mid B_n)P(B_n) \,,$$ where, for any $n$, if $P(B_n) = 0$, then these terms are simply omitted from the summation since $P(A\mid B_n)$ is finite. <p> The set of $B_n$ is also known as a __partition__ of the sample space. <!--SR:!2027-07-16,713,341!2029-09-21,1432,381-->
- [Bayes' theorem](../../../../general/Bayes'%20theorem.md#statement%20of%20the%20theorem) ::@:: __Bayes' theorem__ relates _P_(_A_|_B_) to _P_(_B_|_A_). It states $$P(A \mid B) = \frac {P(B \mid A) P(A)} {P(B)} \qquad P(B) \ne 0 \,.$$ (The course also states _P_(_A_) ≠ 0, but this is not actually required.) Sometimes the theorem is stated in the form where the denominator is replaced using the _law of total probability_. <!--SR:!2025-12-16,313,361!2026-04-13,432,381-->
- supplementary examples
  - [randomized response](../../../../general/randomized%20response.md) ::@::  It allows respondents to respond to sensitive issues (such as criminal behavior or sexuality) while maintaining confidentiality. <p> For example, we want to know about if how much of a population has done something. We prepare two questions: one asking if the person has done something, the other asking if the person has NOT done something. The person randomly choose one of the questions, the probability of which can be calculated by us (e.g. coin flip), to ask. <p> We do not know which question the person gets, so confidentiality is preserved. However, applying Bayes' theorem can still reveal the true prevalence in the population. Therefore, this is an application of Bayes' theorem. <!--SR:!2025-12-26,321,361!2026-01-05,330,361-->
  - the boy who cried wolf ::@:: We can apply Bayes' theorem to mathematically analyze this fable. <!--SR:!2029-04-26,1315,381!2026-04-20,437,378-->
  - [Monty Hall problem](../../../../general/Month%20Hall%20problem.md)
- [independence](../../../../general/independence%20(probability%20theory).md) ::@:: Two events _A_ and _B_ are __independent__ iff $$P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B) \,.$$ otherwise they are __dependent__. <p> Informally speaking, knowing either of the event has happened does not affect the probability of the other. <!--SR:!2026-04-23,440,381!2026-05-19,462,381-->
  - independence / equivalence ::@:: The following statements are equivalent: <ul> <li>_A_ and _B_ are independent.</li> <li>_A_ and _B_<sup>c</sup> are independent.</li> <li>_A_<sup>c</sup> and _B_ are independent.</li> <li>_A_<sup>c</sup> and _B_<sup>c</sup> are independent.</li> </ul> The above can be seen by seeing that the complement of an event is uniquely defined by the event. There is a one-to-one correspondence between a set and its complement (unless the sample space is the empty set, which is impossible for probability). <!--SR:!2026-04-19,437,381!2026-05-13,457,381-->
  - independence / vs. disjoint ::@:: Independent is not disjoint. End of story. <!--SR:!2026-05-11,455,381!2026-04-05,424,381-->
  - independence / pairwise independence ::@:: A finite set of events is __pairwise independent__ iff any two events from the set is _independent_. <p> Pairwise independence does NOT automatically imply _mutual independence_. <!--SR:!2026-04-25,442,381!2026-05-17,460,381-->
  - independence / mutual independence ::@:: A finite set of _n_ events is __mutually independent__ iff any 2 ≤ _k_ ≤ _n_ events from the set is _independent_. For the _independence_ of 2 ≤ _k_ events, this is simply: $$P\left(\bigcap_{i = 1}^k A_k \right) = \prod_{i = 1}^k A_k \,.$$ <p> Mutual independence automatically implies _pairwise independence_. However, note that the above statement must hold for all 2 ≤ _k_ ≤ _n_, not just _k_ = _n_. It is possible to create a sample space such that three events _A_, _B_, and _C_ are independent but none of the three events are _pairwise independent_. <!--SR:!2026-05-18,461,381!2028-06-10,982,361-->

- [random variable](../../../../general/random%20variable.md) (r.v.) ::@:: A __random variable__ (__r.v.__) is a mathematical function. Its _domain_ is the sample space. Its _range_ is a measurable space, usually a finite set of integers or the real numbers. The function need not be _injective_ (different samples need not map to different values). It is commonly denoted by capital letters, with its possible numerical values (also called __realizations__) by the same but lowercase letters. <p> A way to think about random variable is that it maps each outcome to a real number. <!--SR:!2026-03-28,417,378!2028-04-04,976,361-->
  - random variable / motivation ::@:: How do we describe random process more mathematically? Random variables can do so. <!--SR:!2026-05-07,452,381!2026-05-18,461,381-->

  - random variable / types ::@:: There are two common types: _discrete_ random variables and _continuous_ random variables. If a random variable's range is _countable_ (finite or infinite), then the random variable is discrete. if a random variable's range is _uncountable_ and its _cumulative probability distribution_ (CDF) is _continuous everywhere_, then the random variable is continuous. <p> Other types not discussed here are _mixed_ random variables (a mix of discrete and continuous) and _singular_ random variables (neither discrete nor continuous). <!--SR:!2025-12-21,317,361!2028-08-29,1044,361-->
- discrete random variable ::@:: A __discrete random variable__ has a _countable_ (finite or infinite) range. <!--SR:!2026-05-06,450,381!2026-04-02,422,378-->
  - [probability mass function](../../../../general/probability%20mass%20function.md) (PMF, pmf) ::@:: A __probability mass function__ (__PMF__, __pmf__) is a function that gives the probability that a _discrete random variable_ is exactly equal to some value. It is given by: $$p_X(x) = P(X = x) \,.$$ It is not defined for a continuous random variable. <p> The PMF has the following properties: $$\begin{aligned} \sum_x p_X(x) & = 1 \\ p_X(x) & \ge 0 \,. \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2026-05-18,461,381!2026-04-28,444,381-->
    - probability mass function / graph ::@:: To graph a PMF, draw an empty _xy_ graph. Maybe add a title to the graph. Draw _solid_ vertical lines on where the probability mass returns nonzero, representing its value at that point. Draw a _filled_ circle on top of each vertical line. <!--SR:!2028-11-12,1155,380!2026-03-01,370,380-->
- [cumulative distribution function](../../../../general/cumulative%20distribution%20function.md) (CDF, cdf) ::@:: A __cumulative distribution function__ (__CDF__, __cdf__) of a real-valued random variable _X_ is the probability that _X_ will take a value less than or equal to _x_. It is given by: $$F_X(x) = P(X \le x) \,.$$ The probability that _X_ will take a value in between \(_a_, _b_\], where _a_ < _b_, is $$P(a < X \le b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a) \,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-04-12,431,381!2026-05-10,454,381-->
  - cumulative distribution function / properties ::@:: A CDF of any probability distribution _supported on the real numbers_ is a right-continuous monotone increasing function (a càdlàg function) $F: \mathbb R \rightarrow [0, 1]$ satisfying $\lim_{x \to -\infty} F(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{x \to +\infty} F(x) = 1$. <!--SR:!2026-04-26,443,381!2025-12-17,314,361-->
  - cumulative distribution function / existence and uniqueness ::@:: Every probability distribution _supported on the real numbers_, discrete, continuous, "mixed", as well as singular, is uniquely identified by its CDF. Thus, a CDF is defined for every probability distribution supported on the real numbers, even if its probability mass function (PMF) or probability density function (PDF) may be undefined. <!--SR:!2026-01-06,331,361!2025-12-06,319,361-->
  - cumulative distribution function / discrete random variable ::@:: The CDF of a discrete random variable is a non-decreasing step function. <!--SR:!2026-01-16,339,361!2025-11-30,317,358-->
    - cumulative distribution function / discrete random variable / graph ::@:: To graph a CDF for a discrete random variable, draw an empty _xy_ graph. Maybe add a title to the graph. Draw horizontal lines to indicate values of the CDF. Ensure the leftmost and rightmost lines touch the graph edge to show that it extends forever. Draw a _filled_ circle on the left endpoint of all horizontal lines except for the leftmost one. Draw a _hollow_ circle on the right endpoint of all horizontal lines except for the rightmost one. Optionally, draw _dotted_ or _dashed_ vertical lines to make the graph connected. <!--SR:!2028-12-14,1195,380!2027-09-26,818,360-->
- [expected value](../../../../general/expected%20value.md) ::@:: The __expected value__ (__population mean__, __first moment__) is a generalization of the weighted average. Informally, the expected value is the mean of the possible values a random variable can take, weighted by the probability of those outcomes. It is commonly denoted $E(X)$. <!--SR:!2028-03-22,963,361!2026-05-01,446,381-->
  - expected value / discrete random variable ::@:: The expected value of a discrete random variable is the weighted average of all possible outcomes $\mathcal X$: $$\operatorname E[X] = \sum_{x \in \mathcal X} x p(x) \,.$$ This is only defined if the sum converges absolutely, so it is possible for a discrete random variable to have a undefined expected value. <p> Also, $$\operatorname E[g(X)] = \sum_{x \in \mathcal X} g(x) p(x) \,.$$ for an arbitrary function $g(x)$. <!--SR:!2026-05-17,460,381!2026-05-05,450,381-->
  - expected value / linearity ::@:: An important property is its linearity: $$\begin{aligned} E(b) & = b \\ E(aX) & = a E(X) \\ E(aX + b) & = a E(x) + b \\ E(aX + bY) & = a E(x) + b E(Y) \,, \end{aligned}$$ where _a_, _b_ are constants and _X_, _Y_ are any random variables (independence is not required). <!--SR:!2026-04-14,433,381!2026-05-11,455,381-->
- [variance](../../../../general/variance.md) ::@:: __Variance__ is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean of a random variable. It is often represented by $\sigma ^{2}$, $s^{2}$, $\operatorname {Var} (X)$, $V(X)$, or $\mathbb {V} (X)$. <!--SR:!2026-05-12,456,381!2026-04-29,445,381-->
  - variance / discrete random variable ::@:: The variance of a discrete random variable is $$\operatorname{Var}(X) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal X} \left((x - \mu)^2 p(x) \right) \,.$$ This is only defined if the above sum and $\mu$ exists, so it is possible for a discrete random variable to have undefined variance. <!--SR:!2026-03-26,415,378!2025-12-14,311,358-->
  - variance / properties ::@:: A well-known identity relating variance to expected value is $$\operatorname{Var}(X) = \operatorname E\left[X^2\right] - (\operatorname E[X])^2 = \operatorname E\left[X^2\right] - \mu^2 \,.$$ With this identity, the following properties can be proved: $$\begin{aligned} \operatorname{Var}(b) & = 0 \\ \operatorname{Var}(aX) & = a^2 \operatorname{Var}(X) \\ \operatorname{Var}(aX + b) & = a^2 \operatorname{Var}(X) \\ \operatorname{Var}(aX \pm bY) & = a^2 \operatorname{Var}(X) + b^2 \operatorname{Var}(Y) && \text{important, only uses }+ \,, \end{aligned}$$ where _a_, _b_ are constants and _X_, _Y_ are random variables _independent_ from each other, i.e. $$P(X \le x, Y \le y) = P(X \le x) P(Y \le y) \,.$$ (Note: There are random variables that are not _independent_ but the above still holds. Such variables are said to be _uncorrelated_.) <!--SR:!2025-11-27,314,361!2026-05-03,448,381-->

- [probability density function](../../../../general/probability%20density%20function.md) (PDF, pdf) ::@:: The __probability density function__ (__PDF__, __pdf__) of an _absolutely continuous_ random variable is a function whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a _relative likelihood_ that the value of the random variable would be equal to that sample. <p> Probability density is the probability per unit length, in other words, the _absolute likelihood_ for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 since there is an infinite set of possible values to begin with. <p> It is commonly denoted $f_X(x)$ for an absolutely continuous random variable _X_. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,320,361!2028-08-09,1072,361-->

  - probability density function / to and from cumulative distribution function ::@:: For a _Lebesgue-integrable_ function $f_X(x)$, $$\begin{aligned} F_X(x) & = \int_{-\infty}^x \! f_X(x) \,\mathrm{d}x  \\ f_X(x) & = \frac {\mathrm d} {\mathrm dx} F_X(x) && \text{if }f_X(x)\text{ is continuous at }x \,. \end{aligned}$$ <p> Note that if two Lebesgue-integrable functions differ from each other on measure zero, then the resulting $F_X(x)$ is the same. So the PDF cannot uniquely determine a CDF. <!--SR:!2026-05-14,458,381!2026-05-10,454,381-->
  - probability density function / graph ::@:: To graph a PDF for an absolutely continuous random variable, draw an empty _xy_ graph. Maybe add a title to the graph.

  - variance / continuous random variable ::@:: The variance of a continuous random variable is $$\operatorname{Var}(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \! (x - \mu)^2 f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \! (x - \mu)^2 \,\mathrm{d}F(x) \,.$$ This is only defined if the integral exists, so it is possible for a continuous random variable to have undefined variance. <!--SR:!2026-04-19,436,381!2025-12-17,314,361-->
- [Chebyshev's inequality](../../../../general/Chebyshev's%20inequality.md) ::@:: The probability that a random variable deviates from its mean by at least $k\sigma$ is at most $1/k^{2}$, where $k$ is any positive constant and $\sigma$, required to be finite non-zero (also implies finite expected value $\mu$), is the standard deviation (the square root of the variance): $$P(\lvert X - \mu \rvert \ge k \sigma) \le \frac 1 {k^2} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2028-07-23,1056,358!2028-03-08,949,358-->

It can also be used for the number of events in other types of intervals than time, and in dimension greater than 1 (e.g., number of events in a given area or volume). It is denoted $\operatorname{Pois}(\lambda)$, where $\lambda \in (0, \infty)$ is the expectation of number of events in a given interval. <!--SR:!2027-08-03,793,358!2026-05-16,459,381-->

- [normal distribution](../../../../general/normal%20distribution.md) ::@:: The __normal distribution__ or __Gaussian distribution__ is important in statistics and is often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. Their importance is partly due to the central limit theorem. It is denoted $\mathcal N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, where $\mu \in \mathbb R$ is the mean and $\sigma^2 \in \mathbb R_{> 0}$ is the variance.  <p> \(When you see $\mathcal N(0, 100)$, do not mistake the 100 as the standard deviation!

  - normal distribution / proof of being probability distribution ::@:: It is also very easy to see its probability density function is nonnegative (in fact, positive). To see it integrates up to 1 over the real numbers, integrate with respect to $t = \frac {x - \mu} {\sqrt {2 \sigma^2} }$ first (substitution), then the resulting integral contains a Gaussian integral $\int_{-\infty}^\infty \! e^{-t^2} \,\mathrm{d}t$, which has no elementary antiderivative, but when evaluated over the real numbers, yields $\sqrt \pi$. <!--SR:!2028-09-17,1110,368!2026-02-26,336,308-->
  - normal distribution / mean ::@:: For $X \sim \mathcal N\left(\mu, \sigma^2 \right) \,,$ $$\operatorname E[X] = \mu \,.$$  To prove this, turn the additional $x$ in the integrand into $(x - \mu + \mu)$, apply linearity of integration (split into $(x - \mu)$ and $\mu$), and then substitute $t = \frac {x - \mu} {\sqrt {2 \sigma^2} }$. Then the expression should contain a Gaussian integral and an integral that has an odd function as the integrand. The former integral is $\sqrt \pi$ and the latter integral is 0 by symmetry. <!--SR:!2025-12-04,317,361!2027-09-25,757,338-->
  - normal distribution / variance ::@:: For $X \sim \mathcal N\left(\mu, \sigma^2\right) \,,$ $$\operatorname{Var}(X) = \sigma^2 \,.$$  To prove this, substitute $t = \frac {x - \mu} {\sqrt {2 \sigma^2} }$, then substitute $e^{-t^2}$, and finally apply integration by part.

  - normal distribution / shape ::@:: All normal distribution have the bell-shaped regardless of its parameters. Changing the mean simply translates the shape, while increasing the variance fattens (becomes wider) and flattens (the maximum value becomes lower) the shape. <!--SR:!2026-06-11,479,388!2025-12-15,332,368-->

(The table may not show negative values of _z_. In that case, you need to use the property of its CDF above.) <!--SR:!2026-05-19,462,381!2026-04-06,425,381-->

- [moment](../../../../general/moment%20(mathematics).md) ::@:: The ___k_-th (population) moment__ (also called __raw moment__), which is about _the origin_ (not about _the mean_), of a random variable _X_ is defined by $$\operatorname E\left[X^k \right] \qquad k \in \mathbb N_{\ge 1} \,,$$ if _it exists_. (When _k_ = 0 (the "zeroth" moment), this always equal to 1, so we ignore it here.) <p> A _k_-th moment exists if $\operatorname E\left[\left\lvert X^k \right\rvert\right] < \infty$ (Lebesgue integrable). If the _n_-th moment exists _about any point_, so does the $(n - 1)$-th moment (and thus, all lower-order moments) _about every point_. <!--SR:!2026-02-17,363,368!2026-02-09,356,368-->
  - moment / population mean ::@:: The population mean is the 1st _raw_ moment. <!--SR:!2026-07-06,501,388!2026-07-02,497,388-->
- [central moment](../../../../general/central%20moment.md) ::@:: The ___k_-th (population) central moment__, which is about _the mean_ (not about _the origin_), of a random variable _X_ is defined by $$\operatorname E\left[(X - \operatorname E[X])^k\right] \qquad k \in \mathbb N_{\ge 1} \,,$$ if _it exists_. (When _k_ = 0 (the "zeroth" moment), this always equal to 1, so we ignore it here.) <p> A _k_-th central moment exists if $\operatorname E[\lvert X \rvert] < \infty$ and $\operatorname E\left[\left\lvert (X - \operatorname E[X])^k \right\rvert \right] < \infty$ (both Lebesgue integrable). If the _n_-th moment exists _about any point_ (including the value $\operatorname E[X]$), so does the $(n - 1)$-moment (and thus, all lower-order moments) _about every point_. <!--SR:!2028-12-09,1176,368!2026-02-21,365,368-->
  - central moment / population variance ::@:: The population variance is the 2nd _central_ moment. <!--SR:!2026-02-06,354,368!2026-02-08,355,368-->
  - standardized (central) moment ::@:: The ___k_-th standardized (central) moment__ is the _k_-th (central) moment that is standardized by dividing by $\sigma^k$, where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. Mathematically, $$\tilde \mu_k = \frac {\mu_k} {\sigma^k} = \frac {\operatorname E\left[(X - \mu)^k \right]} {\operatorname E\left[(X - \mu)^2 \right]^{k / 2} } = \operatorname E\left[\left(\frac {X - \mu} \sigma \right)^k \right] \,.$$ <p> Hence, the 1st standardized central moment is 0, the 2nd standardized central moment is 1, the 3rd standardized central moment is the _skewness_, the 4th standardized central moment is the _kurtosis_, etc. <!--SR:!2026-01-30,349,368!2026-02-26,370,368-->
    - standardized central moment / skewness ::@:: __Skewness__ is the 3rd _standardized_ central moment: $$\tilde \mu_3 = \operatorname E\left[\left(\frac {X - \mu} \sigma\right)^3 \right] = \frac {\mu_3} {\sigma^3} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2025-12-21,334,368!2026-01-11,351,368-->
    - standardized central moment / kurtosis ::@:: __Kurtosis__ is the 4th _standardized_ central moment: $$\tilde \mu_4 = \operatorname E\left[\left(\frac {X - \mu} \sigma\right)^4 \right] = \frac {\mu_4} {\sigma^4} \,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-01-10,350,368!2026-06-01,471,388-->

- [moment-generating function](../../../../general/moment-generating%20function.md) (MGF, mgf) ::@:: The __moment-generating function__ (__MGF__, __mgf__) of _a real-valued random variable_ is defined as $$M_X(t) = \operatorname E\left[e^{tX} \right] \,,$$ provided that _this expectation exists (and is finite) for $t$ in some open neighborhood (open interval) of 0_. Otherwise, the moment generating function does not exist (e.g. Cauchy distributions). <p> In this course, unless otherwise specified, we assume the MGF exists. <!--SR:!2025-12-05,325,368!2026-06-21,488,388-->
  - moment-generating function / use ::@:: Its primary use is finding the _k_-th raw moment of a real-valued random variable _X_. The _k_-th raw moment is obtained by evaluating the _k_-th derivative of its moment-generating function at 0: $$\operatorname E\left[X^k \right] = M_X^{(k)}(0) = \left[\frac {\mathrm d^k} {\mathrm dt^k} M_X(t) \right]\Bigr|_{t = 0} \qquad k \in \mathbb N_0 \,.$$ When _k_ = 0, the "zeroth" raw moment is always 1, and the above formula also gives 1. <p> The above can be proved by differentiating the expectation, assuming the interchange of the differentiation and expectation operator is legitimate. <!--SR:!2025-12-22,335,368!2026-02-05,353,368-->
  - moment-generating function / binomial distribution ::@:: For $X \sim B(n, p) \,,$ $$M_X(t) = \left(pe^t + 1 - p \right)^n \,.$$ To find the above function, for the expression $M_X(t) = \sum_{k = 0}^n e^{tk} \binom n k p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}$, merge $e^{tk}$ into $p^k$ and apply the binomial theorem in reverse. <!--SR:!2028-05-11,1023,368!2026-05-28,435,328-->
  - moment-generating function / normal distribution ::@:: For $X \sim \mathcal N\left(\mu, \sigma^2 \right) \,,$ $$M_X(t) = \exp\left(\mu t + \frac {\sigma^2 t^2} 2 \right) \,.$$ To find the above function, merge $e^{tx}$ into $e^{-\frac {(x - \mu)^2} {2\sigma^2} }$, extracting the constants out and completing the square in the exponent to get a Gaussian integral $\int_{-\infty}^\infty \! e^{-x^2} \,\mathrm{d}x$, which yields $\sqrt \pi$. Another way to prove the above that may be easier is by finding the moment-generating function $M_Z(t)$ for the _standard_ normal distribution _Z_ first, then use the fact $X = \sigma Z + \mu$. <!--SR:!2027-05-12,645,308!2026-06-18,450,328-->

  - When you see $\mathcal N(0, 100)$, do not mistake the 100 as the standard deviation! It is the variance. Almost screwed this up in the midterm examination...
    - $\mathcal N(0, 100)$ (0) ::@:: The mean of the normal distribution is 0. The standard deviation of the normal distribution is 10, not 100. <!--SR:!2026-07-09,491,404!2026-08-14,520,404-->

- [point estimation](../../../../general/point%20estimation.md)
  - point estimation / motivation ::@:: Assume there is a random variable _X_. We know its probability distribution type $F$ (CDF) but not all of its parameters $\theta, \ldots$: $X \sim F(x; \theta, \ldots)$. <p> From a sample of _X_, we want to estimate the unknown parameters. <!--SR:!2026-08-27,500,396!2027-04-19,684,415-->
  - [parameter space](../../../../general/parameter%20space.md) ::@:: It is the space of all possible parameter values that define a particular mathematical model. It is also sometimes called weight space, and is often a subset of finite-dimensional Euclidean space. <p> For CDFs with known parameters $\vec \varphi$ and unknown parameters $\vec \theta$ $F(x; \vec \varphi, \vec \theta)$, the family of CDFs is $\set{F(x; \vec \varphi, \vec \theta) : \vec \theta \in \vec \Theta}$, where $\Theta$ is the set of all reasonable values (depends on the given information) that $\vec \theta$ can take on. <!--SR:!2027-04-18,683,417!2026-04-28,403,397-->
  - point estimation / terminology ::@:: A statistic used to estimate a _parameter_ (or a _function of parameters_) is a _point estimator_ of that parameter. A realization of such a statistic is a _point estimate_ of the same parameter. <p> For example, <br/> $\overline X$ and $\overline x$ are respectively a point estimator and point estimate of $\mu = \operatorname E[X]$. <br/> $S_{n - 1}^2$ and $s_{n - 1}^2$ are respectively a point estimator and point estimate of $\sigma^2$. <br/> $S_n^2$ and $s_n^2$ are respectively a point estimator and point estimate of $\sigma^2$ (yes, it is the same as above). <!--SR:!2027-05-18,716,417!2027-06-06,732,417-->
  - point estimation / uniqueness ::@:: A parameter or a function of parameters can have multiple different point estimators and point estimates. <p> For example, $S_{n - 1}^2$ and $S_n^2$ are both point estimators for $\sigma^2$. The former is used for its _unbiasedness_, while the latter is used in method of moments (since $\overline {X^2} = (\overline X)^2 + S_n^2$ but $\overline {X^2} \ne (\overline X)^2 + S_{n - 1}^2$). <!--SR:!2026-08-29,494,397!2026-04-27,402,397-->
- [method of moments](../../../../general/method%20of%20moments%20(statistics).md) ::@:: You have _k_ parameters of a known distribution to estimate. Express the first _k_ raw population moments in terms of the _k_ parameters, assuming _they exist_: $\operatorname E[X], \ldots, \operatorname E\left[X^k\right]$. Calculate the _k_ raw sample moments: $\overline X, \ldots \overline {X^k}$. Equate them: $\operatorname E[X] = \overline X, \ldots, \operatorname E\left[X^k\right] = \overline {X^k}$. Now there are _k_ (nonlinear in general) equations to solve for _k_ parameters. If _a solution exist_, the solution produce the estimators for _k_ parameters. <!--SR:!2027-06-14,740,417!2027-06-08,734,417-->
  - method of moments / choice of moments ::@:: While choosing any _k_ raw moments would work, first _k_ raw moments are used as errors due to sampling increase with the order of the moments. Different choices yield different estimators. <p> For multiple random variables, there are many choices of raw moments leading to different estimators. <!--SR:!2026-08-30,495,397!2026-06-28,450,397-->
    - method of moments / choice of moments / note ::@:: \(__this course__: We choose estimators that require the lowest moments. <p> For example, for $X \sim \operatorname{Poisson}(\lambda)$, since $\mu_X = \lambda$ and $\sigma_X^2 = \lambda$, $\hat \lambda = \overline X$ and $\hat \lambda = S_n^2$ are both point estimators for $\lambda$. We choose the first one.\) <!--SR:!2027-05-07,705,417!2026-01-08,294,377-->
  - method of moments / solving ::@:: Since the _k_ equations are nonlinear in general, there are no guarantees that tractable solutions exist. <p> For hand computation, if it is linear, you can use matrix methods. If not, you need to think of ways to substitute equations into each other. <p> In general, this involves changing the subject of $\overline {X^i} = \operatorname E\left[X^i\right]$ to a parameter $\theta_i$ to get a new equation, and then substitute this equation into other equations, until you have an equation that that is a function of a parameter in terms of the raw sample moments $\overline {X}, \ldots, \overline {X^k}$ _only_ (i.e. no other parameters $\theta_k$). <!--SR:!2027-03-31,665,417!2027-05-31,726,417-->
  - method of moments / estimator properties ::@:: The estimators are _consistent_ (under very weak assumptions) but _often biased_. <!--SR:!2026-07-29,470,397!2026-04-25,400,397-->
  - method of moments / advantages, disadvantages ::@:: Advantages are the estimators are _consistent_ (under very weak assumptions). <p> Disadvantages are the estimators are _often biased_, may not be _unique_, requires the existence of the first _k_ raw population moments, and only works well when the sample size is large. <!--SR:!2027-06-07,733,417!2027-02-21,608,357-->
- [point estimation](../../../../general/point%20estimation.md)
  - point estimation / properties ::@:: biasedness, consistency, efficiency, sufficiency <!--SR:!2027-04-24,691,417!2026-09-27,515,397-->
  - point estimation / biasedness ::@:: The expected value of an estimator may be written as: $$\operatorname E[\hat \theta] = \theta + b_N(\hat \theta) \,$$ where $b_N(\hat \theta)$ is the __bias__ (it _may_ be a function of the number of samples _N_ or other things). <p> The estimator is __unbiased__ if $b_N(\hat \theta) = 0$. If not _unbiased_, it is __biased__. Additionally an _biased_ estimator is _also_ __asymptotic unbiased__ if $\lim_{N \to +\infty} b_N(\hat \theta) = 0$. <p> Intuitively, this describes how _accurate_ (but not how _precise_) an estimator is. <!--SR:!2027-05-29,724,417!2027-06-22,748,417-->
  - point estimation / efficiency ::@:: An estimator for $\theta$, denoted $\hat \theta_1$, is more _efficient_ than another estimator for the same parameter, denoted $\hat \theta_2$, if $\operatorname{Var}(\hat \theta_1) < \operatorname{Var}(\hat \theta_2)$, regardless of the actual value of $\theta$ (that is, you do not need to care about if the estimators are biased or not). <p> (In this course, the lecture slides only compare estimators that are _unbiased_ for _all possible values_ in the parameter space. And it also uses $\le$ instead of $<$...) <p> Intuitively, this describes how _precise_ (but not how _accurate_) an estimator is. <!--SR:!2026-08-10,480,397!2027-02-19,606,357-->
  - point estimation / consistency (untaught) ::@:: (untaught) It is about whether the point estimate stays close to the value when the parameter increases its (sample) size. <p> An estimator $T_n$ (in this context, _n_ is the number of samples, but can be other things) is __weakly consistent__ iff $$(\forall \theta \in \Theta) (\forall \varepsilon > 0) \left( \lim_{n \to \infty} \Pr(\lvert T_n - \theta \rvert > \varepsilon) = 0 \right)\,.$$ It is __strongly consistent__ iff $$\Pr\left(\lim_{n \to \infty} T_n = \theta \right) = 1 \quad \forall \theta \in \Theta\,.$$ <!--SR:!2027-06-25,623,317!2025-12-05,259,357-->
    - [consistent estimator](../../../../general/consistent%20estimator.md)
  - point estimation / sufficiency (untaught) ::@:: (untaught) Let X =\(X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ..., X<sub>n</sub>\) be a random sample. A statistic T(X) is said to be __sufficient__ for θ (or for the family of distribution) if the conditional distribution of X given T is free from θ. <p> Intuitively, this is saying all information about θ contained in X is used in T. So conditioning X on T is independent of the actual value of θ. <p> The motivation is that statisticians can use sufficient statistics for analysis without losing relevant information of the original samples. <!--SR:!2027-03-27,661,417!2027-08-02,694,357-->

- [interval estimation](../../../../general/interval%20estimation.md)
  - interval estimation / Why interval estimation instead of point estimation? ::@:: The latter cannot provide the precision (i.e. is the actual parameter close) and reliability (i.e. is the actual parameter _likely_ to be close) of the estimators. And sometimes, a range is more meaningful than a point. <!--SR:!2026-09-06,502,397!2026-09-28,516,397-->
  - interval estimation / terminology ::@:: __Random interval__ is the methodology. <p> Given a sample, the calculated random interval is a __confidence interval__ (or if using other methods, it could be __credible interval__, __likelihood interval__, etc. but we will not touch these). <!--SR:!2026-07-13,461,397!2027-04-27,694,417-->
  - random interval ::@:: Assume the parameter space is 1-dimensional (i.e. only 1 parameter). <p> In point estimation, we estimate a point in the parameter space using a statistic: $\hat \theta = T$. In interval estimation, we estimate a interval in the parameter space using two statistics: $\theta \in (T_1, T_2)$. Said interval is a __random interval__. <p> In general, the larger the interval, the more _reliable_ it is, but the less _precise_ it is, and vice versa. <!--SR:!2027-04-12,679,417!2027-06-16,742,417-->
- [confidence interval](../../../../general/confidence%20interval.md) ::@:: It is an interval which is expected to typically contain the parameter being estimated. More specifically, given a __confidence level__ $\gamma$ (95% and 99% are typical values), a CI is a random interval which contains the parameter being estimated $100\gamma$% of the time. <p> Note: This course uses $100(1 - \alpha)$% instead of $\gamma$%. So $\alpha$ is the probability that a random interval from a theoretical sample does not contain the population parameter. <!--SR:!2026-07-09,457,397!2027-04-10,677,417-->
  - confidence interval / definition ::@:: Wikipedia uses $$P(T_1 < \theta < T_2) \ge \gamma \,,$$, with equality replacing $\ge$ when the distribution is continuous. This course uses $$P(T_1 \le \theta \le T_2) \ge 1 - \alpha \,,$$ with equality replacing $\ge$ when the distribution is continuous. <!--SR:!2026-01-08,294,377!2027-06-05,731,417-->
  - confidence interval / construction ::@:: Simply find two statistics. <p> In practice, the two statistics are found _symmetrically_ (i.e. the confidence interval of a random sample has the same probability of lying on the left or right of and outside the actual population parameter), so that its precision is the highest (the interval is the smallest), given the underlying probability is unimodal and symmetric. <!--SR:!2027-04-24,689,417!2027-06-12,738,417-->
  - confidence interval / interpretations ::@:: It can be expressed in terms of a long-run frequency in _repeated samples_, probability with respect to _a single theoretical (yet to be realized) sample_, _statistical significance_, etc. <!--SR:!2027-06-11,737,417!2026-08-19,484,397-->
    - confidence interval / interpretations / misinterpretations ::@:: It does not mean for a given realized interval, there is a $1 - \alpha$% probability that the population parameter lies within the interval. The frequentist interpretation says once an interval is calculated, this interval _either covers_ the parameter value _or it does not_; it is no longer a matter of probability. <p> Less common misinterpretations include $1 - \alpha$% of the sample data lie within the confidence interval; and $1 - \alpha$% probability of the parameter estimate from a _repeat_ of the experiment falling within the confidence interval computed from a given experiment. <!--SR:!2029-01-24,1171,377!2026-06-16,438,397-->
- [chi-squared distribution](../../../../general/chi-squared%20distribution.md) ::@:: It with $k$ _degrees of freedom_ is the distribution of a sum of the _squares_ of $k$ _independent standard normal random variables_. It is denoted $\chi^2(k)$ (in this course) or $\chi_k^2$. <!--SR:!2026-01-10,220,377!2027-06-11,737,417-->
  - chi-squared distribution / probability density function (PDF) ::@:: (Probably no need to memorize this...) $$f(y) = \begin{cases} \frac 1 {2^{n / 2} \Gamma(n / 2) } y^{n / 2 - 1} e^{-y / 2} & \text{if }y > 0, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ <!--SR:!2027-02-06,601,357!2026-12-06,550,357-->
  - chi-squared distribution / shape ::@:: It looks like a right-skewed (left-leaning) hill. The higher the $k$, the lower the peak and the fatter the hill. Note that for $k = 1, 2$, the peak is at $x = 0$. <!--SR:!2027-05-19,717,417!2025-12-01,256,357-->
  - chi-squared distribution / additivity ::@:: If $V \sim \chi^2(v)$ and $W \sim \chi^2(w)$ are _independent_, then $V + W \sim \chi^2(v + w)$. This is obvious from the definition... <!--SR:!2027-05-22,719,417!2027-04-29,694,417-->
  - chi-squared distribution / statistics ::@:: Let $Y \sim \chi^2(k)$. Then $\operatorname E[Y] = k$ and $\operatorname{Var}(Y) = 2k$. <!--SR:!2026-09-18,512,397!2025-12-24,205,337-->
- [Student's t-distribution](../../../../general/Student's%20t-distribution.md) ::@:: It is continuous probability distribution that generalizes the standard normal distribution. Like the latter, it is symmetric around zero and bell-shaped. (This course denotes it by $t(\nu)$ instead of $t_\nu$.) <p> However, it has heavier tails and the amount of probability mass in the tails is controlled by the parameter $\nu$. For $\ \nu =1\ {}$ the Student's _t_ distribution $t_{\nu }$ becomes the standard [Cauchy distribution](../../../../general/Cauchy%20distribution.md), which has very ["fat" tails](../../../../general/fat-tailed%20distribution.md); whereas for $\ \nu \rightarrow \infty \ {}$ it becomes the standard normal distribution $\ {\mathcal {N} }(0,1)\,$ which has very "thin" tails. <!--SR:!2026-04-17,367,377!2027-07-09,675,357-->
  - Student's t-distribution / definition ::@:: If $Z \sim \mathcal N(0, 1)$, $Y \sim \chi^2(\nu)$, and $Z$ and $Y$ are _independent_, then $W = Z \sqrt{\nu / Y}$ means $W \sim t(\nu)$. <!--SR:!2027-09-16,727,357!2025-12-18,96,337-->
  - Student's t-distribution / probability density function (PDF) ::@:: (Probably no need to memorize this...) $$f(w) = \frac {\Gamma((n + 1) / 2)} {\sqrt{\pi n} \Gamma(n / 2)} \left(1 + \frac {w^2} n\right)^{-(n + 1) / 2}$$ <!--SR:!2027-01-20,584,357!2026-03-02,347,377-->

- [normal distribution](../../../../general/normal%20distribution.md)
  - normal distribution / sample mean ::@:: For _n_ samples of a population $X \sim \mathcal N\left(\mu_X, \sigma_X^2\right)$, we have $$\begin{aligned} \overline X & \sim \mathcal N\left(\mu_X, \sigma_X^2 / n\right) \\ (\overline X - \mu_X)\sqrt{n / \sigma_X^2} & \sim \mathcal N(0, 1) \,. \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2026-09-01,497,397!2026-01-08,294,377-->
- [Cochran's theorem](../../../../general/Cochran's%20theorem.md)
  - Cochran's theorem / special case ::@:: For _n_ samples of a population $X \sim \mathcal N\left(\mu_X, \sigma_X^2\right)$ and its _corresponding_ normalized population $Z \sim \mathcal N(0, 1)$, $\overline X$ and $S_{X, n - 1}^2$ (or $S_{X, n}^2$) are _independent_. Further, we have $$\begin{aligned} \sum_{i = 1}^n (Z_i - \overline Z)^2 & \sim \chi^2(n - 1) \\ \sum_{i = 1}^n \left(\frac {X_i - \overline X} {\sigma_X} \right)^2 = \frac {(n - 1) S_{X, n - 1}^2 } {\sigma_X^2} & \sim \chi^2(n - 1) \,. \end{aligned}$$ (For the second line, $n S_{X, n}^2 = (n - 1) S_{X, n - 1}^2$ would also work.) <!--SR:!2026-04-04,352,377!2026-07-18,409,337-->
    - Cochran's theorem / special case / intuition ::@:: The squared deviations from the mean (SDM) of a sample of a normal population, given the _population mean_ is known, has _n_ degrees of freedom. But only the sample mean is known, which has 1 degree of freedom. So if we compute the SDM of a sample using the _sample mean_ instead of the _population mean_, it has $n - 1$ degrees of freedom. <!--SR:!2026-09-04,500,397!2027-05-24,719,417-->
      - Cochran's theorem / special case / intuition / execution ::@:: For example: Consider $$U_{n - 1} := \frac {(n - 1) S_{X, n - 1}^2 } {\sigma_X^2} \sim \chi^2(n - 1) \,.$$ Wrapping it in $\sqrt{n - 1 / U_{n - 1} }$, we get: $$\sqrt{\sigma_X^2 / S_{X, n - 1}^2} \,,$$ which can be used to replace $\sigma_X^2$ in $(\overline X - \mu_X) \sqrt{n / \sigma_X^2} \sim \mathcal N(0, 1)$ to $(\overline X - \mu_X) \sqrt{n / S_{X, n - 1}^2} \sim t(n - 1)$. <p> Another example: Consider $$U_{n - 2} := \frac {(n - 2) s_{\varepsilon, n - 2}^2 } {\sigma_\varepsilon^2} \sim \chi^2(n - 2) \,.$$ Wrapping it in $\sqrt{n - 2 / U_{n - 2} }$, we get: $$\sqrt{\sigma_\varepsilon^2 / S_{\varepsilon, n - 2}^2 } \,,$$ which can be used to replace $\sigma_\varepsilon^2$ in $(\hat \beta_1 - \beta_1) \sqrt{S_{XX} / \sigma_\varepsilon^2} \sim \mathcal N(0, 1)$ to $(\hat \beta_1 - \beta_1) \sqrt{S_{XX} / S_{\varepsilon, n - 2}^2} \sim t(n - 2)$. <!--SR:!2027-08-06,697,357!2028-03-22,863,357-->
  - Cochran's theorem / corollary ::@:: For _n_ samples of a population $X \sim \mathcal N\left(\mu_X, \sigma_X^2\right)$ and its _corresponding_ normalized population $Z \sim \mathcal N(0, 1)$, we have $$\begin{aligned} \overline Z \sqrt {n / S_{Z, n - 1}^2} & \sim t(n - 1) \\ (\overline X - \mu_X) \sqrt{n / S_{X, n - 1}^2} & \sim t(n - 1) \,. \end{aligned}$$ (Notice how similar this is to $(\overline X - \mu_X) \sqrt{n / \sigma_X^2} \sim \mathcal N(0, 1)$...) <!--SR:!2026-08-17,428,337!2026-09-04,500,397-->

  - confidence interval / realization ::@:: Simply substitute the estimators with their corresponding estimates to find the confidence interval. <!--SR:!2026-08-30,502,397!2029-05-30,1308,397-->

- [statistical hypothesis test](../../../../general/statistical%20hypothesis%20test.md) ::@:: It is a method of _statistical inference_ used to decide whether the data sufficiently supports a particular hypothesis. A statistical hypothesis test typically involves a _calculation of a test statistic_. Then a decision is made, either by comparing the test statistic to a _critical value_ or equivalently by _evaluating a p-value_ computed from the test statistic. <!--SR:!2027-05-23,718,417!2026-08-21,494,397-->
  - statistical hypothesis test / brief history (untaught) ::@:: (untaught) Historically, there were two approaches: Fisher's null hypothesis testing and Neyman–Pearson decision theory. <p> Nowadays, we are basically doing a hybrid of both. <!--SR:!2027-05-15,713,417!2027-05-16,711,417-->
    - statistical hypothesis test / brief history / Fisher's null hypothesis testing (untaught) ::@:: (untaught) It sets up a null hypothesis (but no alternative hypothesis), which need not be a nil (zero difference) hypothesis. <p> Then report the exact level of significance. But in any case, you are neither "accepting" nor "rejecting" the null hypothesis. If the result is not significant, make no decision and suspend judgement: you do not "accept" the null hypothesis. <p> As a result, there is no Type II (false negative) error, since if the result is not significant, you neither "accept" nor "reject". <!--SR:!2028-12-13,1137,377!2026-08-30,495,397-->
    - statistical hypothesis test / brief history / Neyman–Pearson decision theory (untaught) ::@:: (untaught) It sets up two hypothesis, H1 and H2. Define a rejection region for each hypothesis. <p> If the data falls into the rejection region of H1, accept H2; otherwise accept H1. Accepting a hypothesis does not mean that you believe in it, but only that you act as if it were true. <p> As a result, there are Type I (false positive) error and Type II (false negative) error. <!--SR:!2025-12-01,256,357!2025-12-05,259,357-->
  - statistical hypothesis ::@:: It is an assertion or conjecture or statement about the population, usually formulated in terms of _population parameters_. <!--SR:!2026-08-19,484,397!2026-09-21,514,397-->
  - [null hypothesis](../../../../general/null%20hypothesis.md) ::@:: It is denoted $H_0$. It is the hypothesis that is assumed to be true and then tested to be rejected or not to be rejected formally. <p> It always contains a "=" sign (i.e. =, ≤, ≥). <!--SR:!2027-03-25,659,417!2027-05-21,719,417-->
  - [alternative hypothesis](../../../../general/alternative%20hypothesis.md) ::@:: It is denoted $H_1$. It is the hypothesis that contains the values of the parameter we would _accept_ if we _reject_ $H_0$. <o> It never contains a "=" sign, except in a _simple test_ (only two possible values for the parameter). <!--SR:!2027-05-05,700,417!2026-03-27,346,377-->
  - statistical hypothesis test / types ::@:: There are 4 types: simple test, one-sided left test (alternative is smaller), one-sided right test (alternative is larger), and two-sided test. <p> We do a two-sided test by default unless we have enough information (e.g. if a parameter being too high is acceptable, then we do a one-sided left test). <!--SR:!2027-05-21,716,417!2026-07-08,456,397-->
    - statistical hypothesis test / types / notation ::@:: simple test: $\begin{cases} H_0: \theta = \theta_0 \\ H_1: \theta = \theta_1 \end{cases}$ <br/> one-sided left test: $\begin{cases} H_0: \theta = \theta_0 \\ H_1: \theta < \theta_0 \end{cases}$ <br/> one-sided right test: $\begin{cases} H_0: \theta = \theta_0 \\ H_1: \theta > \theta_0 \end{cases}$ <br/> two-sided test: $\begin{cases} H_0: \theta = \theta_0 \\ H_1: \theta \ne \theta_0 \end{cases}$ <!--SR:!2027-05-12,709,417!2027-03-24,658,417-->
  - statistical hypothesis test / steps ::@:: Define $H_0$ and $H_1$. Assuming $H_0$ is true, define a _rare event_. Collect data. If the data contradicts $H_0$ (by having the _rare event_ happen), we reject $H_0$ and accept $H_1$. Otherwise, we "_do not reject_" (not "_accept_") $H_0$. <!--SR:!2026-08-24,497,397!2026-04-26,401,397-->
  - statistical hypothesis test / errors ::@:: There are two types of error: Type I error/false positive and Type II error/false negative. <p> Since "positive" means rejecting $H_0$, so Type I error/false positive is rejecting $H_0$ but $H_0$ is true, while Type II error/false negative is _not_ rejecting $H_0$ but $H_0$ is false. <!--SR:!2027-05-28,723,417!2026-08-19,492,397-->
    - statistical hypothesis test / errors / calculations ::@:: We can calculate the two errors' probabilities using conditional probability: $$\begin{aligned} \alpha = \Pr(\text{Type I error}) & = \Pr(\text{reject }H_0 \mid H_0\text{ is true}) \\ \beta = \Pr(\text{Type II error}) & = \Pr(\text{not reject }H_0 \mid H_0\text{ is false}) \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2027-05-27,722,417!2027-06-13,739,417-->
    - statistical hypothesis test / errors / use ::@:: We want both Type I error $\alpha$ and Type II error $\beta$ to be as low as possible. But in general, we cannot decrease both simultaneously when the sample size is fixed. <p> We usually instead guarantee $\alpha$ does not exceed a desired low value, then find a test statement with the smallest $\beta$. <p> $\alpha$ is also known as the __level of significance__. $1 - \beta$ is also known as the __power__ of the test statement. <!--SR:!2026-09-04,500,397!2027-05-10,705,417-->
      - [statistical significance](../../../../general/statistical%20significance.md) ::@:: It is the probability of the study rejecting the null hypothesis, given that the null hypothesis is true. <p> Common misconception: It is very easy to swap the two events in the above conditional probability around, e.g. "A level of significance of 5% means, on average, 5 out of 100 times that we reject the null hypothesis, it is the wrong decision." <!--SR:!2028-02-23,913,377!2026-04-19,395,397-->
  - critical values ::@:: They, of a statistical test, are the boundaries of the acceptance region of the test. The acceptance region is the set of values of the test statistic for which the null hypothesis is not rejected (not "_accepted_", however, even if the region is called "acceptance region"). Depending on the shape of the acceptance region, there can be one or more than one critical value. <!--SR:!2026-03-09,335,377!2026-09-09,505,397-->
    - critical values / determination ::@:: If we fix the Type I error/false positive $\alpha$, we determine the critical values by determining the distribution of the test statistic (e.g. $\overline X$), and then make the rejection regions cover enough of the distribution so that its area equals $\alpha$, while minimizing $\beta$. <p> For a one-sided test or simple test, there is _usually_ only one critical value, and this _usually_ minimizes $\beta$ automatically. For a two-sided test, there are _usually_ only two critical values, chosen to have equal areas (i.e. $\alpha / 2$) on both sides, and this _usually_ minimizes $\beta$ automatically. <!--SR:!2028-04-13,950,377!2026-12-19,562,357-->
  - [_p_-value](../../../../general/p-value.md) ::@:: It is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the result actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct. <p> Common misconception: It is very easy to swap the two events in the above conditional probability around, e.g. "_p_-value is the possibility of making the wrong decision if you reject the null hypothesis." <!--SR:!2027-05-25,722,417!2027-06-09,737,417-->
    - _p_-value / use ::@:: $p$ is the ___p_-value__. $\alpha$ is the __significance level__. If $p \le \alpha$ (the slides use $p < \alpha$), then we have enough evidence to reject $H_0$ _at a significance level_ $\alpha$. Otherwise, if $p > \alpha$ (the slides _still_ use $p > \alpha$), then we do _not_ have enough evidence to reject $H_0$ _at a significance level_ $\alpha$ (but we are not _accepting_ it). <!--SR:!2025-12-05,259,357!2026-09-17,511,397-->

Reject or not reject $H_0$. Use judgement based on if $H_0$ is rejected or not. <!--SR:!2026-04-29,404,397!2027-06-04,730,417-->

- [power](../../../../general/power%20(statistics).md) ::@:: It is a measure of the ability of an experimental design and hypothesis testing setup to detect a particular effect if it is truly present. <p> For hypothesis testing, this is the probability of rejecting $H_0$ given $H_0$ is false. Thus it is calculated as $1 - \beta$. <!--SR:!2026-04-20,396,397!2027-06-10,736,417-->
  - power / use ::@:: It is often used to assess the _goodness of a test statement_. Two test statements having the same significance level $\alpha$ can be compared using this. <p> To increase the power $1 - \beta$, we can increase $\alpha$, or we can increase the sample size if we do not want to change $\alpha$. <!--SR:!2026-08-20,493,397!2027-05-18,713,417-->

If using _p_-value, $c := \overline x$ and $p$ is the _p_-value. Note that for two-sided test, when using critical value, the critical value approach uses $\left\lvert (\overline x - \mu_0) \sqrt{n / \sigma_X^2} \right\rvert > c := z_{\alpha / 2}$, instead of comparing $\overline x$ against the $c$ as first defined. <!--SR:!2026-08-10,421,337!2027-06-20,662,357-->

- [Pearson correlation coefficient](../../../../general/Pearson%20correlation%20coefficient.md) ::@:: It is a _correlation coefficient_ that measures linear correlation between two sets of data. <p> It is the ratio between the covariance of two variables and the product of their standard deviations; thus, it is essentially a normalized measurement of the covariance, such that the result always has a value between −1 and 1. <!--SR:!2026-09-10,506,397!2028-05-22,980,377-->

  - Pearson correlation coefficient / interpretation ::@:: If positive, then they are _positively linearly correlated_. If negative, then they are _negatively linearly correlated_. Otherwise, it means they have no linear relationship (_linearly uncorrelated_), but it does not take _nonlinear relationships_ into account. <p> The coefficient takes neither _nonlinear relationships_ nor _slope_ into account. It only indicates the _strength_ and _direction_ of a _linear_ relationship. <p> If the points have no variance in one direction, then the points lie on a horizontal or vertical line.

  - Fisher transformation / properties ::@:: If the two random variables being considered is a bivariate normal distribution and the sample pairs are i.i.d., then $z = \frac 1 2 \ln \left(\frac {1 + r} {1 - r}\right)$ is _approximately_ $$\begin{aligned} Z & \sim \mathcal N\left(\frac 1 2 \ln \left(\frac {1 + \rho} {1 - \rho} \right), \frac 1 {N - 3 }\right) \\ \left(Z - \frac 1 2 \ln \left(\frac {1 + \rho} {1 - \rho}\right) \right) \sqrt{N - 3} & \sim \mathcal N(0, 1) \end{aligned} \,$$ where $N$ is the number of samples.

- report
  - Is a report necessary in this case...?
  - time limit ::@:: The time limit was enough to finish all questions and check them for 20 minutes. This, of course, assumes you are very familiar with the methods used. <!--SR:!2027-07-25,770,427!2026-03-11,361,407-->
  - moment-generating function (0) ::@:: Remember to always check the domain of the expression you have gotten. If the domain is missing some numbers, you may still be able to evaluate $\operatorname E\left[e^{tX}\right]$ with $t$ set to the missing numbers to fill the domain. For example, after filling in the missing numbers, you may finally get $$\begin{cases} \frac {e^{5t} - e^{2t} } {3t}, & t \ne 0 \\ 1, & t = 0 \,. \end{cases}$$ <!-- <p> (The instructor said only I had gotten it correct...) --> <!--SR:!2026-09-24,519,407!2027-06-04,732,427-->
