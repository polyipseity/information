- HKUST ISOM 2020

The content is in teaching order.

- format: pre-lecture videos → weekly exercise (graded, infinite attempts) → lecture → lab (graded, attendance required) → practice question set (ungraded, optional)
- general recommendations: Do NOT use techniques not learnt in lectures! Also, if you have learnt Python before well, you would find some quiz questions extremely ambiguous with imprecise wordings. Good luck guessing the answer!
