- HKUST ISOM 2020

The content is in teaching order.

- general recommendations ::: Do NOT use techniques not learnt in lectures! Also, if you have learnt Python before well, you would find some quiz questions extremely ambiguous with imprecise wordings. Good luck guessing the answer!
- course logistics
  - pathway: ISOM 2020 → ISOM 2600
  - duration: 7 weeks, for the first half of the semester
  - time: 2 hour lectures, 2 hour labs
  - format: pre-lecture videos → weekly exercise (graded, infinite attempts) → lecture → lab (graded, attendance required) → practice question set (ungraded, optional)
  - grading scheme: weekly exercise 10%, lab submissions 20%, final exam 70% (basic programming test 45%, free coding exam 25%)
  - course intended learning outcomes (CILOs): understand coding logic, Python basics, and hands-on guidance
- final exam: 2024-10-19T14:30:00+08:00/2024-10-19T17:30:00+08:00 (PT3H)

## week 1 pre-lecture

- time: 2024-09-01+08:00T12:00:00+08:00
- [basics](basics.md)
  - [§ arithmetic operators](basics.md#arithmetic%20operators)
    - [basics § arithmetic operators](basics.md#arithmetic%20operators) / note ::: They really like testing you on the return type of operators... for a somewhat obvious reason.
  - [§ mathematics](basics.md#mathematics)
  - [§ output](basics.md#output)
    - [basics § output](basics.md#output) / note ::: They teach `'''` but not `"""` for some reason...
  - [§ variable](basics.md#variable)
    - [basics § variable](basics.md#variable) / note ::: In a quiz question, they use the word "save", which means storing a value to a variable.
  - [§ data types](basics.md#data%20types)
    - [basics § data types](basics.md#data%20types) / note ::: They have not taught `None` and `NoneType` up to this point.
- week 1 exercise

## week 1 lecture

- time: 2024-09-06T16:00:00+08:00/2024-09-09T17:50:00+08:00
- course logistics
- [Python](../../../../general/Python.md) ::: It is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability.
  - Python / why ::: beginner-friendly (simple, elegant), free and open-source, runs anywhere, supported by a large community, extensible with libraries (flexible), "batteries included": many standard libraries
- [§ week 1 pre-lecture](#week%201%20pre-lecture)
- week 1 practice question set

## week 2 pre-lecture

- time: 2024-09-09+08:00T12:00:00+08:00
- [basics](basics.md)
  - [§ data type conversion](basics.md#data%20type%20conversion)
  - [§ input](basics.md#input)
    - [basics § input](basics.md#input) / note ::: It seems like Juypter automatically adds a space after the prompt... But other environments do not. Also, the prompt is optional (i.e. `input()` is okay and does not prints anything before asking for user input). Lastly, `prompt` does not need to be a `str`, and other objects are accepted. This is similar to `print(...)`, except that a newline is NOT automatically printed, and it only accepts a single argument (i.e. `input("a", "b")` is NOT okay).
- [list](list.md)
  - [§ syntax](list.md#syntax)
  - [§ indexing](list.md#indexing)
    - [list § indexing](list.md#indexing) / note ::: We have not learnt slicing so far, so do not use it.
  - [§ manipulation](list.md#manipulation)
  - [§ length](list.md#length)
  - [§ aggregate functions](list.md#aggregate%20functions)
- week 2 exercise
