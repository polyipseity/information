# information

- HKUST TEMG 3950

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../../../../tools/utility.py.md
```

## context

Education needs to prepare for {@{future jobs that we do not know now}@}. This is needed to adapt in our {@{very fast moving world of disruptive technology}@}, such as autonomous flying taxis, ChatGPT, etc. One way to do that is via {@{learning [metaknowledge](../../../../general/metaknowledge.md)}@}.

Some important metaknowledge in this 21st century are the 4Cs: {@{collaboration to solve large problems, communication to convince people, creativity to make new things, and critical thinking and problem solving to solve problems}@}.

## part 1: product innovation

_Previously, case analysis was part 1._

Prepares for TEMG 4970: T&M startup business plan.

The product for the project of this part needs to be {@{realistic, might be successful, and could be developed in about 2 years. High technology is not necessary}@}.

## part 2: case analysis

_Previously, product innovation was part 2._

Prepares for TEMG 4950 — T&M consulting for a real client or TEMG 4940 — T&M prototyping for a real client.

The case method, i.e. using case analysis for teaching, can teach {@{identifying assumptions, issues, and relationships}@}. From said information, {@{conclusions, deductions, and inferences can be made}@}. It also helps with {@{evaluating authority, evidence, and logicalness of your thinking}@}, {@{making self-corrections}@} as necessary. Finally, you can {@{present your solution persuasively}@}.
