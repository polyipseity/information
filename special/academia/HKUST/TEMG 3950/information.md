## context

Education needs to prepare for {{future jobs that we do not know now}}. This is needed to adapt in our {{very fast moving world of disruptive technology}}, such as autonomous flying taxis, ChatGPT, etc. One way to do that is via {{learning [metaknowledge](../../../../general/metaknowledge.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-08,33,270!2024-06-28,48,290!2024-07-04,56,310-->

Some important metaknowledge in this 21st century are the 4Cs: {{collaboration to solve large problems, communication to convince people, creativity to make new things, and critical thinking and problem solving to solve problems}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-06,45,250-->

## part 1: product innovation

_Previously, case analysis was part 1._

The product needs to be {{realistic, might be successful, and could be developed in about 2 years. High technology is not necessary}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-04,29,270-->
