# HKUST TEMG 3950 information

%%

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../../../../tools/utility.py.md
```

## context

Education needs to prepare for {{future jobs that we do not know now}}. This is needed to adapt in our {{very fast moving world of disruptive technology}}, such as autonomous flying taxis, ChatGPT, etc. One way to do that is via {{learning [metaknowledge](../../../../general/metaknowledge.md)}}.

Some important metaknowledge in this 21st century are the 4Cs: {{collaboration to solve large problems, communication to convince people, creativity to make new things, and critical thinking and problem solving to solve problems}}.

## part 1: product innovation

_Previously, case analysis was part 1._

The product needs to be {{realistic, might be successful, and could be developed in about 2 years. High technology is not necessary}}.
