## examples

- [`Cascadia Wikimedians User Group - Income statement as of Dec 13, 2015.jpg`](../../../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Cascadia%20Wikimedians%20User%20Group%20-%20Income%20statement%20as%20of%20Dec%2013,%202015.jpg) ::@:: ![`Cascadia Wikimedians User Group - Income statement as of Dec 13, 2015.jpg`](../../../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Cascadia%20Wikimedians%20User%20Group%20-%20Income%20statement%20as%20of%20Dec%2013,%202015.jpg)

## format

- header ::@:: company name, `(Consolidated) Statement of Income`, duration, (monetary unit)
  - header / duration ::@:: example: `For the Year ended December 31, 2019`, `For the period September 1, 2024 to December 13, 2015`
  - header / monetary unit ::@:: example: <br/> (none; not recommended) <br/> `(in million of dollars, except per share data)`
- dollar sign ::@:: Add it before the first number and the last 2 numbers ("net income", "earnings per share"). The rest can be omitted.
- totals ::@:: It's somewhat arbitrary. At least calculate: <br/> total revenue: or omit me if your revenue is simply one item <br/> total operating expenses <br/> income from operations <br/> income before taxes <br/> net income
  - total / format ::@:: Indent totals at least once. <p> Add a (over)line above totals. <p> For income from operations, income before income taxes, and net income, do not indent and bold the names. <p> For net income (and earnings per share), additionally add double (under)lines below the totals.
- negative number ::@:: Write negative numbers in brackets, not with a minus sign. For example, write `(42)` instead of `-42`.
  - negative number / expenses ::@:: Note that expenses, while they reduce net income, are still written as positive numbers. This includes income tax expense. <p> One exception is when the revenues and expenses are mixed together in the other items.
- casing ::@:: Use title case for basically everything!!! (Ignore that I have been NOT using title case in this note.)
- (root) ::@:: operating (+) <br/> other items (+) <br/> income tax expense <br/> __net income__: income before income taxes âˆ’ income tax expense <br/> earnings per share
  - (root) / (+) ::@:: (+) means "has children".
  - (root) / operating ::@:: example: <br/> sales revenue <br/> operating expenses (+) <br/> __income from operations__: sum above appropriately
    - (root) / operating / operating expenses ::@:: example: (many items on this level) (+) <br/> general and administrative expenses (+) <br/> depreciation expense <br/> loss on disposal of assets <br/> total operating expenses: sum above appropriately
      - (root) / operating / operating expenses / (many items on this level) ::@:: example: <br/> supplies expense <br/> wages expense <br/> rent expense <br/> insurance expense <br/> utilities expense <br/> repairs expense <br/> other operating expenses
      - (root) / operating / operating expenses / general and administrative expenses ::@:: example: <br/> training expense <br/> advertising expense
  - (root) / other items ::@:: example: <br/> interest revenue <br/> interest expense <br/> __income before income taxes__: sum above appropriately
- financial metrics ::@:: Calculate earnings per share, at least round to 2 decimal places. Additionally add double (under)lines below it.
  - earnings per share :: $$\frac {\text{net income} - \text{preferred dividends} } {\text{(time-)weighted average outstanding common shares} }$$
