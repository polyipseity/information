- surprising terms in equation ::@:: accounts payable turnover, earnings per share
- surprising "net" in equation ::@:: current assets, fixed asset turnover, quick assets, receivables turnover, total assets

## list

The list is not exhaustive.

- [current ratio](../../../../general/current%20ratio.md) ::@:: $$\frac {\text{current assets (CA)} } {\text{current liabilities (CL)} } \,,$$ noting that current assets include current contra-assets.
- [quick ratio](../../../../general/quick%20ratio.md#formula) ::@:: $$\frac {\text{quick assets (QA)} } {\text{current liabilities (CL)} } \,,$$ where $$\text{quick assets (QA)} = \text{current assets (CA)} - \text{inventory (I)} - \text{prepaid expenses (PE)} \,,$$ noting that current assets include current contra-assets.
- [earnings per share](../../../../general/earnings%20per%20share.md) ::@:: $$\frac {\text{net income} - \text{preferred dividends} } {\text{(time-)weighted average outstanding common shares} }$$
- [net sales](../../../../general/sales%20(accounting).md#gross%20sales%20and%20net%20sales) ::@:: $${\text{gross sales} }-{\text{(customer discounts, returns, allowances)} }$$ For the service industry, the latter does not really exist, so it's simply gross sales, or operating revenues.
- net profit margin ::@:: $$100\% \cdot \frac {\text{net income} } {\text{net sales} }$$ (Expressing it as a fraction or ratio, i.e. not multiplying by 100%, is also okay!)
- [total asset turnover](../../../../general/asset%20turnover.md) ::@:: $$\frac {\text{net sales} } {\text{average total assets} }$$ The average total assets is not time-weighted. It is simply the average between the beginning balance and the ending balance. Note that total assets include contra-assets.
- [receivables turnover ratio](../../../../general/receivables%20turnover%20ratio.md) ::@:: $$\frac {\text{net sales} } {\text{average net trade accounts receivables} }$$ Average net trade accounts receivable is not time-weighted, it is simply the average of the beginning and the ending balance. The adjective _net_ means discounts and allowances need to be removed. <p> "Net sales" should really be "net receivable sales" to only account for credit sales, but net credit sales are normally not reported separately.
- average collection period ::@:: $$\frac {365} {\text{receivables turnover ratio} }$$
- [inventory turnover](../../../../general/inventory%20turnover.md) ::@:: $$\frac {\text{cost of goods sold} } {\text{average inventory at cost} }$$ <p> Average inventory at cost is simply the average of the value of starting inventory and ending inventory. It is not time-weighted.
- average days to sell inventory ::@:: $$\frac {365} {\text{inventory turnover} }$$
- fixed asset turnover ::@:: $$\frac {\text{net sales} } {\text{average net fixed assets} }$$ The average _net fixed_ assets is not time-weighted. It is simply the average between the beginning balance and the ending balance. Note that the _net_ means accumulated depreciation needs to be less from fixed assets first for both balances.
- [working capital](../../../../general/working%20capital.md) ::@:: $$\text{current assets (CA)} - \text{current liabilities (CL)}$$
- accounts payable turnover ::@:: $$\frac {\text{total supplier purchases} } {\text{average accounts payable} }$$ Average accounts payable is not time-weighted. It is simply the average of the beginning balance and ending balance. <p> (Funny history... The book has "cost of goods sold" as the numerator instead. Anyways, use the above definition.)
- average days to pay payables ::@:: $$\frac {365} {\text{accounts payable turnover} }$$
- [dividend yield](../../../../general/dividend%20yield.md) ::@:: $$\frac {\text{dividends per share} } {\text{market price per share} } \times 100\%$$
- [price/earnings ratio](../../../../general/priceâ€“earnings%20ratio.md) ::@:: $$\frac {\text{market price per share} } {\text{earnings per share} }$$
- quality of income ratio ::@:: $$\frac {\text{cash flow from operating activities} } {\text{net income} }$$
- capital acquisitions ratio ::@:: $$\frac {\text{cash flow from operating activities} } {\text{cash paid for PPE} }$$
- [free cash flow](../../../../general/free%20cash%20flow.md) ::@:: $$\text{cash flow from operating activities} - \text{dividends} - \text{capital expenditures}$$
