- datetime: 2024-09-12T13:30:00+08:00/2024-09-12T14:50:00+08:00
- [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md)
  - [financial accounting § principles](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md#principles) ::@:: relevant and timely information, faithful representation, separate entity, time period, going concern, stable monetary unit, mixed-attribute measurement <!--SR:!2027-02-10,616,297!2025-12-07,301,297-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / relevant and timely information ::@:: Record only information that affects decision, and before a decision that is relevant to said information is to be made. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,321,337!2027-01-23,626,317-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / faithful representation ::@:: The record is complete, neutral, and accurate. This is a cornerstone of financial reporting and professional ethics. <!--SR:!2026-09-10,531,317!2026-10-23,572,317-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / separate entity ::@:: Financial reporting is for the entity (the company), not owners of it. Managers are the _agents_ who operate the entity, a _legal person_, which is owned by the stockholders, the _principal_. <!--SR:!2026-07-24,495,317!2028-06-12,1025,337-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / time period ::@:: It refers to the reporting period. It can be monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. Interim reports are reported in between annual financial reports. <!--SR:!2028-06-14,1063,357!2025-12-17,305,277-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / [going concern](../../../../general/going%20concern.md) ::@:: The business is assumed to survive in the forseeable future, or at least long enough to meet its contractual obligations in the next reporting period. It is a basic but essential assumption. Otherwise, financial statements are prepared under the _liquidation basis_ of accounting, which is different from the basis we are learning. <!--SR:!2025-11-15,320,337!2029-01-07,1228,357-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / stable monetary unit ::@:: Also known as the _measuring unit principle_. It assumes changes in the purchasing power of measurement units are insufficiently important to require adjustment to financial statements, i.e. no adjustment for inflation and deflation. This does not apply during hyperinflation, and a different measurement must be used (see _mixed-attribute measurement_ below). <!--SR:!2026-03-06,354,297!2026-12-14,558,317-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / mixed-attribute measurement ::@:: Different measurement models may be applied to different assets and liabilities. There are two models: historical cost (value at the time of transaction), and fair value (value at the time of reporting). This is to be covered in ACCT 3010 and ACCT 3020. <!--SR:!2027-11-06,867,337!2027-10-27,857,337-->

- [expense](../../../../general/expense.md) ::@:: any specific outflow of cash or other valuable assets from a person or company to another person or company; decrease in assets or increase in liabilities from ongoing operations <!--SR:!2026-09-09,531,317!2028-10-02,1150,357-->
  - [§ expense](../../../../general/expense.md#expense)
  - [expense](../../../../general/expense.md) / loss ::@:: decrease in assets or increase in liabilities from peripheral activities (side activities) <!--SR:!2025-11-24,329,337!2025-11-18,323,337-->
- [consolidated financial statement](../../../../general/consolidated%20financial%20statement.md) (CFS) ::@:: a financial statement in which the parent company and all its subsidiaries are presented as those of a single economic entity <!--SR:!2028-08-19,1114,357!2027-07-19,775,337-->
- [balance sheet](../../../../general/balance%20sheet.md)

    - [balance sheet](../../../../general/balance%20sheet.md) / missing elements / unrecorded liabilities ::@:: Unrecorded liabilities, in particular leases (e.g. temporary contract to use others' equipment for a cost), have been forbidden because of US GAAP-ASC 842 (2018-12-15) and IFRS/HKFRS 16 (2019-01-01). <!--SR:!2026-06-05,416,297!2027-09-28,828,337-->
      - [balance sheet](../../../../general/balance%20sheet.md) / missing elements / unrecorded liabilities / examples ::@:: off-balance-sheet financing, i.e., obligations that are not reported as liabilities on the balance sheet; e.g., cash outflows of aircraft operating leases were not reported as debt on balance sheet <!--SR:!2026-08-10,507,317!2026-09-24,540,317-->
- accounting evolution ::@:: Accounting practices are always updating. For example, lease transactions have moved from a classification approach to a recognition approach. <!--SR:!2029-02-25,1265,357!2027-08-06,793,337-->
  - accounting evolution / classification approach ::@:: There are 2 main types called _operating leases_ and _finance leases_ (and a related type called as _sale-leasebacks_). The former may NOT appear in the balance sheet. The latter allows the lessee (the entity who has the temporary right to use) to treat it similar to an asset and claim depreciation. <!--SR:!2026-05-06,410,277!2025-11-17,273,277-->
  - accounting evolution / recognition approach ::@:: Now, most leases are required to be recorded. At commencement, the asset "right-of-use" is debited while the liability "lease liability" is credited. At year end, "lease liability" is debited while the asset "cash/bank" is credited. <!--SR:!2027-11-17,819,297!2027-09-28,706,277-->
    - accounting evolution / recognition approach / [income statement](../../../../general/income%20statement.md) ::@:: At year end, the expense "depreciation" is recorded (and debited in the balance sheet) while the asset "accumulated depreciation" is credited in the balance sheet. This depreciates the asset "right-of-use". <!--SR:!2026-01-29,355,297!2027-09-12,812,337-->

  - [accounting equation](../../../../general/accounting%20equation.md) / A restaurant buys meat patties for $6&nbsp;000 _on credit_ (promise to pay later). ::@:: A increases by $6&nbsp;000, and L increases by $6&nbsp;000, balancing the accounting equation. Upon settlement of the liability (fulfilled the promise to pay), A decreases by $6&nbsp;000, and L decreases by $6&nbsp;000, still balancing the accounting equation.

  - [bad debt](../../../../general/bad%20debt.md) / allowance method ::@:: At year-end adjustments, bad debts are _estimated_, and then a transaction credits a contra-asset called "Allowance for doubtful accounts" and debits a expense called "Bad debt expense". <p> When bad debts are known throughout the year, they are debited from "Accounts receivable" and credited to the contra-asset mentioned above. If a bad debt is later unexpectedly recovered, the reverse happens. <!--SR:!2027-08-07,746,363!2027-02-15,603,356-->

For each age interval, estimate % uncollectible. Multiply the percentage for each age interval, and then sum them up together to get a final number. Then, debit to "Bad debt expense" and credit from "Allowance for doubtful accounts" an amount such that "Allowance for doubtful accounts" will have a _credit_ (not _debit_) balance of the above final number.

The adjective _net_ means discounts and allowances need to be removed. <p> "Net credit sales" may be "net sales" in practice, since net credit sales are normally not reported separately. <!--SR:!2026-06-14,415,336!2027-03-25,641,363-->
  - [receivables turnover ratio](../../../../general/receivables%20turnover%20ratio.md) / interpretation ::@:: It measures how many times average receivables are recorded and collected for the year. <p> A higher ratio benefits the company because it can collect the money earlier for investment. It is related to how generous payment schedules are. A sudden decline in the ratio may mean a company is extending payment deadlines to prop up lagging sales or recording bad sales. <!--SR:!2027-03-31,647,363!2026-08-13,493,403-->

    - perpetual inventory / specific identification ::@:: The cost of each unit is tracked. When they are unit, the specific costs are added to COGS. <p> This usually applies to high-value, low-volume, or heterogeneous products such as diamonds, precious stones, properties, etc., because the tracking overhead is large. <!--SR:!2026-10-14,547,403!2027-06-16,703,363-->
    - [FIFO and LIFO accounting](../../../../general/FIFO%20and%20LIFO%20accounting.md)
    - perpetual inventory / first-in, first-out (FIFO) <br/> Each purchase batch has its cost per unit tracked. Then whenever a unit is sold, the unit cost of the _earliest_ batch is added to COGS, regardless if this is the case physically.
      - perpetual inventory / FIFO / effect ::@:: It usually gives lower COGS (thus lower inventory turnover), higher pretax income, and higher ending inventory, since older units are less valuable. <p> Managers preferring to report higher earnings choose this. <!--SR:!2026-04-02,380,383!2026-12-23,528,343-->
    - perpetual inventory / last-in, first-out (LIFO) <br/> Each purchase batch has its cost per unit tracked. Then whenever a unit is sold, the unit cost of the _latest_ batch is added to COGS, regardless if this is the case physically. However, companies who must sell older goods first (e.g. perishable goods) will probably not use LIFO.
      - perpetual inventory / LIFO / effect ::@:: It usually gives higher COGS (thus higher inventory turnover), lower pretax income, and lower ending inventory, since newer units are more valuable. <p> Managers preferring to pay the least tax and as late as possible choose this. Allowable under US GAAP but _not_ IFRS. If used for income tax return, it _must_ also be used to calculate inventory and COGS for financial statements. <!--SR:!2025-11-03,239,356!2026-10-14,547,403-->
    - [weighted average cost](../../../../general/average%20cost%20method.md#weighted%20average%20cost) ::@:: Goods available for sale and its cost are tracked. Then whenever a unit is sold, the weighted average unit cost of all batches is added to COGS. The weighted average unit cost is calculated as $$\frac {\text{cost of goods available for sale} } {\text{number of units available for sale} } \,.$$ <!--SR:!2026-07-15,469,396!2025-12-21,277,363-->
      - weighted average cost / effect ::@:: Its effect is in between FIFO and LIFO. <!--SR:!2026-10-11,544,403!2026-09-02,510,396-->

- [lower of cost or market](../../../../general/lower%20of%20cost%20or%20market.md) (LCM) ::@:: Normally, ending inventory is stated at historical cost. However, when the replacement cost (updated: net realizable value) is lower (but not higher) than the unit cost in ending inventory, i.e. current purchase price for identical cost, the ending inventory unit cost is adjusted to this lower value. <p> This is done by adding an adjustment entry that debits COGS and credits inventory. <!--SR:!2027-08-03,746,363!2026-09-29,534,403-->
  - lower of cost or market / motivation ::@:: This is motivated by convention of conservatism: choosing between two solutions, the one that will be least likely to overstate assets and income should be selected. <p> This also explains why the replacement cost going up does not mean we should increase the ending inventory value. <!--SR:!2026-07-07,464,396!2026-08-07,490,403-->
- [inventory turnover](../../../../general/inventory%20turnover.md) ::@:: $$\frac {\text{cost of goods sold} } {\text{average inventory at cost} }$$ <p> Average inventory at cost is simply the average of the value of starting inventory and ending inventory. It is not time-weighted. <!--SR:!2027-01-30,604,363!2026-02-21,346,376-->
  - inventory turnover / interpretation ::@:: This ratio reflects how many times average inventory was produced or purchased and sold during the period. <p> A higher ratio indicates that inventory moves more quickly (strong sales), thus reducing storage & obsolescence costs. <p> Caution: it could also mean ineffective buying (or without a good buying plan to meet the customers' demand). <!--SR:!2028-05-28,991,376!2027-05-23,689,363-->
  - average days to sell inventory ::@:: $$\frac {365} {\text{inventory turnover} }$$ <!--SR:!2026-08-09,489,403!2026-04-04,381,383-->
    - average days to sell inventory / interpretation ::@:: This ratio indicates the average time it takes to produce/buy and deliver inventory to customers, i.e., to change inventory to COGS. <!--SR:!2026-03-14,365,383!2026-04-08,385,383-->
- [inventory valuation](../../../../general/inventory%20valuation.md)
  - [perpetual inventory](../../../../general/perpetual%20inventory.md)
    - perpetual inventory / accounting ::@:: Purchased goods are directly added to asset "Inventory" on purchase. Sold goods are removed from asset "Inventory" on sale. <!--SR:!2028-06-25,1027,383!2025-12-21,301,383-->
  - [periodic inventory](../../../../general/periodic%20inventory.md)
    - periodic inventory / accounting ::@:: Purchased goods are added to asset "Purchases" on purchase. Sold goods are ignored. <p> At year end, the actual cost of goods sold is computed. Two adjustment entries are added. First, both the asset "Purchases" and the asset "Inventory (beginning)" are credited to zero balance, and the expense "Cost of goods sold" is debited. Then, the expense "Cost of goods sold" is credited such that it matches the actual cost of goods sold, and the asset "Inventory (ending)" is debited. <!--SR:!2026-09-14,323,323!2026-01-03,304,376-->

- [capital expenditure](../../../../general/capital%20expenditure.md) (CAPEX) ::@:: Money spent in buying and improving (repairs may or may not be included, depending on the repair nature) _fixed_ assets. <p> If insufficient, it limits operation capacity. If excessive, there is excess capacity. <!--SR:!2026-08-10,490,403!2025-11-26,280,376-->
- [fixed asset](../../../../general/fixed%20asset.md) ::@:: It is is a term used in accounting for assets and property that may not easily be converted into cash. It may be tangible or intangible, but usually only tangible ones are referred as such; intangible ones are directly referred by a more specific name. <p> IAS 16.6 defines it as _tangible items_ that (a) are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes and (b) are expected to be used during more than one period. <!--SR:!2028-08-02,1057,383!2027-03-18,634,356-->
  - tangible asset ::@:: They are assets that have a physical substance. Examples include land (_not_ depreciable), assets subject to _depreciation_, natural resources subject to _depletion_, etc. <!--SR:!2027-12-19,870,376!2026-03-25,372,383-->
  - [intangible asset](../../../../general/intangible%20asset.md) ::@:: It is an asset that lacks physical substance. Definite-life examples include copyrights, franchises, patents, rights-of-use, etc. Indefinite-life examples include goodwill, trademarks, etc. <!--SR:!2026-10-04,538,403!2026-07-08,465,396-->
  - fixed assets / acquisition ::@:: They may be acquired using cash, debt, non-cash methods (e.g. common stock, additional paid-in capital), or a combination of the above. <!--SR:!2025-12-19,299,383!2026-08-01,486,403-->
- [cost principle](../../../../general/cost%20principle.md) ::@:: Assets should always be recorded at their cost, when the asset is new and also for the life of the asset. <p> Record at the current market value of the consideration given, or the current market value of the asset acquired, whichever is more clearly evident. <p> Such costs are said to be _capitalized_. <!--SR:!2026-09-22,527,396!2026-03-09,357,376-->
  - cost principle / by construction ::@:: All reasonable and necessary expenditures (e.g. _capitalized interest_, costs to get it up and running, materials, wages paid, etc.) in constructing an asset should be _capitalized_. <p> Do note, however, no actual expense or revenue is recorded. A conversion of non-fixed assets into fixed-assets is recorded instead. <!--SR:!2026-09-09,516,396!2026-04-06,364,383-->
  - cost principle / exclusions ::@:: Costs do not include cash discounts or finance charges. <!--SR:!2025-11-02,240,363!2026-09-08,517,403-->
- [capital expenditure](../../../../general/capital%20expenditure.md) (CAPEX)
  - capital expenditure / characteristics ::@:: increase efficiency <br/> involve large amounts of money <br/> major overhaul or improvements <br/> may extend useful life <br/> occurs infrequently usually <!--SR:!2028-08-07,1061,383!2026-04-07,384,383-->
  - capital expenditure / effects ::@:: Such expenditure is deferred. Current net income is higher, so is taxes. Accumulated depreciation is higher later. <!--SR:!2026-08-03,486,396!2027-10-01,758,363-->
- [operating expense](../../../../general/operating%20expense.md) (opex) ::@:: Also called __revenue expenditure__ (rarely). It is an ongoing cost for running a product, business, or system. <!--SR:!2028-07-19,1046,383!2026-08-22,502,403-->
  - revenue expenditure / characteristics ::@:: does not extend useful life beyond original estimate <br/> does not increase efficiency <br/> maintains normal operating conditions <br/> recurring in nature and involves small amounts of money at each occurrence <!--SR:!2028-12-22,1155,383!2028-07-06,1036,383-->
  - revenue expenditure / effects ::@:: Such expenditure is currently recognized. Current net income is lower, so is taxes. Depreciation expense is lower later. <!--SR:!2026-10-03,537,403!2026-02-18,346,383-->
- capital expenditure vs. operating expenditure ::@:: Since they have different effects, many companies have policies regarding the expensing of all expenditures below a certain amount according to the _materiality constraint_. <!--SR:!2026-09-16,523,403!2025-11-03,259,376-->
- [depreciation](../../../../general/depreciation.md) ::@:: As fixed assets are used to earn revenue, they become "used". According to the matching principle, an expense should be recorded. <p> To do so, expense "Depreciation" is debited while contra-asset "Accumulated depreciation" is credited. <!--SR:!2026-08-01,484,396!2026-03-29,376,383-->
  - depreciation / required information ::@:: acquisition cost, estimated useful life, estimated residual value (at the end of useful life) <!--SR:!2026-08-30,507,396!2026-03-09,361,383-->
  - depreciation / methods ::@:: straight line, units-of-production, accelerated method (declining balance) <!--SR:!2026-04-05,382,383!2026-09-24,530,403-->
  - depreciation / straight-line ::@:: Simplest, most often used. <p> $$\text{annual depreciation expense} = \frac {\text{cost of fixed asset} - \text{residual value} } {\text{useful life of fixed asset (years)} }$$ <p> If net book value or residual value changes, the expense is calculated using net book value, residual value, and remaining useful life. <!--SR:!2026-10-13,546,403!2026-09-20,525,396-->
  - depreciation / units-of-production ::@:: Used when the useful life of an assets is better measured in units produced instead of time, e.g. airplanes. <p> $$\text{annual depreciation expense} = \frac {\text{cost of fixed asset} - \text{residual value} } {\text{estimated total production} } \times \text{actual production}$$ <p> If net book value or residual value changes, the expense is calculated using net book value, residual value, and remaining production. <!--SR:!2026-09-17,523,403!2028-08-20,1059,383-->
  - depreciation / accelerated depreciation ::@:: More depreciation expense is allocated in the early life of an asset. The depreciation rate is doubled. <p> $$\text{annual depreciation expense} = \frac {\text{net book value} } {\text{useful life of fixed asset (year)} / 2}$$ Net book value is cost of fixed asset subtracted by its corresponding accumulated depreciation. <p> Every time you depreciate, make sure the net book value is not below the residual value. If so, it should be changed to the residual value. Also, at the end of the useful life, the net book value should be directly changed to the residual value, since the above may not be sufficient to do so. <p> If net book value or residual value changes, the expense is calculated using net book value, residual value, and remaining useful life. <!--SR:!2027-03-10,626,356!2028-02-02,835,363-->
  - [net book value](../../../../general/book%20value.md) ::@:: $$\text{cost of fixed asset} - \text{corresponding accumulated depreciation}$$ <!--SR:!2026-09-08,515,396!2026-09-10,517,396-->
- [impairment](../../../../general/impairment%20(financial%20reporting).md) ::@:: An asset can lose value. First, see if there are indicators of impairment. Then, test if the asset is recoverable. If yes, nothing happens. If no, measure the impairment and adjust the asset value. <!--SR:!2026-08-26,506,403!2026-08-21,499,396-->
  - [impaired asset](../../../../general/imparied%20asset.md)
  - impairment / indicators ::@:: examples: <br/> significant pattern of decline in the market price of the PPE <br/> lower demand for a medium to long-term period for the asset's service due to global economic conditions <br/> severe change in economic or legal factors affecting the company or its assets <br/> obsolescence or physical damage to the PPE <br/> asset is held for disposal or is part of a restructuring <!--SR:!2027-10-30,770,363!2026-07-19,445,343-->
  - impairment / recoverability ::@:: If the assets' estimated future cash flows (FCF) is at least its net book value (NBV), nothing happens. Otherwise, impairment occurs. <!--SR:!2026-07-28,480,396!2026-10-06,540,403-->
    - [discounted cash flow](../../../../general/discounted%20cash%20flow.md) ::@:: It is a method used to value a security, project, company, or asset, that incorporates the time value of money. <!--SR:!2026-07-18,472,403!2026-01-13,320,383-->
  - impairment / measurement ::@:: The FCF is below NBV. Now measure the fair value (FV) of the asset. This may be computed from the FCF using discounted cash flow (DCF; not covered now), or other methods. It should be the case that FV ≤ FCF. The difference between FV and NBV is the impairment loss. <p> The adjustment entry debits expense "Impairment loss" and credits the relevant assets. <!--SR:!2026-02-25,334,376!2026-01-24,234,376-->
    - [fair value](../../../../general/fair%20value.md) ::@:: It is a rational and unbiased estimate of the potential market price of a good, service, or asset. <!--SR:!2026-03-07,342,383!2026-10-11,544,403-->
- fixed asset
  - fixed asset / disposal ::@:: When you sell or dispose an asset, you need to add an journal entry. Due to accumulated depreciation, some care is needed to handle this. <p> Debit whatever you have received for the disposal. Then credit contra-asset "Accumulated depreciation" to remove the _corresponding_ accumulated depreciation, Then credit the relevant asset at its _cost_. Check if debit and credit balances out. If so, there is neither gain nor loss. Otherwise, there is either _gain_ or _loss_. Finally, either credit the gain or debit the loss. <!--SR:!2027-11-28,789,363!2026-05-17,397,383-->
- depreciation
  - depreciation / change ::@:: If net book value or residual value changes, the expense is calculated using net book value, residual value, and remaining useful life or production. <!--SR:!2027-02-14,602,356!2026-08-22,502,403-->
- [asset turnover](../../../../general/asset%20turnover.md)
  - fixed asset turnover ::@:: $$\frac {\text{net sales} } {\text{average net fixed assets} }$$ The average _net fixed_ assets is not time-weighted. It is simply the average between the beginning balance and the ending balance. Note that the _net_ means accumulated depreciation needs to be less from fixed assets first for both balances. <!--SR:!2026-01-12,313,383!2025-12-06,267,363-->
    - fixed asset turnover / interpretation ::@:: It measures how efficient management is at using _fixed_ assets to generate sales. Usually, high means effective management, low may mean there is a problem with using one or more fixed assets. <!--SR:!2026-01-16,317,383!2027-03-27,643,363-->

  - working capital / interpretation ::@:: It affects a company's long-term _investment effectiveness_, _financial strength_ to cover short-term liabilities, and represents what a company currently has to finance its _immediate operational needs_, e.g., to pay vendors, acquire inventories etc. <p> Changes in working capital accounts are important to managers & analysts because they have a direct impact on cash flows from _operating activities_. <p> Too much of it may tie up resources in unproductive assets. <!--SR:!2027-04-06,653,363!2028-08-01,1047,383-->
- [secured loan](../../../../general/secured%20loan.md) ::@:: It is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset (e.g. a car or property) as collateral for the loan, which then becomes a secured debt owed to the creditor who gives the loan. <p> The debt is thus secured against the collateral, and if the borrower defaults, the creditor takes possession of the asset used as collateral and may sell it to regain some or all of the amount originally loaned to the borrower. <!--SR:!2026-07-31,483,396!2026-03-08,356,376-->
- notes payable
  - long-term notes payable ::@:: They are relatively small debt, usually filled from single source, e.g. banks. <!--SR:!2026-04-07,384,383!2026-10-02,536,403-->

- report
  - HKUST yellow answer book (0?, scary) ::@:: I had just realized that the left-hand side is intended for rough work... You are supposed to write your answers on the right-hand side near the end of the exam. Have I been using it wrongly the whole time? <p> I asked the professor after the exam and he said do not worry about it... Let's hope so. <p> Update: Yes, awesome! <!--SR:!2027-02-01,635,414!2027-03-11,645,414-->
  - overall
    - overall / bullet points ::@:: For questions that can be answered using bullet points, 1 mark means 1 bullet point. Try to not merge your points together into one bullet point, even if the TA said she would try to distinguish the points. And if you cannot think of enough bullet points to match the marks, force yourself to write that many bullet points anyway. <!--SR:!2027-08-09,778,428!2027-07-13,751,428-->
    - overall / stupid points ::@:: Recalling and writing the definition of concepts, as stupid as it sounds, gives marks... <!--SR:!2026-09-29,510,408!2027-08-11,780,428-->
  - multiple choice questions (−4, multiple choice questions) ::@:: 90% (36/40) accuracy. The solution was not given. <!--SR:!2027-06-03,711,428!2026-11-12,526,408-->
  - long question 2 (−2, long question)
    - long question 2 / explain why operating cash flow is negative but net income is positive using the cash flow statement (−2) ::@:: There were 9 points, and you need to answer 6 points for full marks. <p> First, not enough bullet points were written. Second, apparently the following are some of the points they want: net income includes the effects of accrual and deferral; indirect method reverses these effects to get the operating cash flow; etc. <!--SR:!2026-05-14,372,388!2026-10-11,521,408-->
  - long question 3 (0, long question)
    - long question 3 / interest expense at the last payment period (0) ::@:: When a debt is specified in terms of fixed payments, the calculated interest expense may cause the fixed payment to underpay or overpay the principal. In that case, adjust the interest expense such that the fixed payment repays the principal exactly. <p> This is a minor detail that many may gloss over... and causes uncertainty in exams. <!--SR:!2027-06-15,723,428!2027-07-18,756,428-->
  - long question 4 (−1, long question)
    - long question 4 / explain your decision made among three choices using present value of money (−1) ::@:: Only two bullet points had been written. No official solution was given, and you probably should copy from the textbook or something... <!--SR:!2026-09-30,511,408!2027-08-10,779,428-->
  - long question 5 (−2, long question)
    - long question 5 / Is earnings per share (EPS) a good indicator of a company's future performance? (−1) ::@:: No, obviously. But I have only written two bullet points. <p> The three points are: no; because EPS indicates the company's performance in the past period, not the future; stock price is a better indicator (price/earnings ratio also acceptable). <!--SR:!2027-05-02,696,428!2026-05-10,368,388-->
    - long question 5 / describe stock split (0) ::@:: The two points are: each stock of a company gets split into several stocks with proportionally smaller market price; the par value per stock decreases but the total par value remains the same. <!--SR:!2027-08-12,781,428!2026-11-06,518,408-->
    - long question 5 / reason for stock split after a surge in stock price (−1) ::@:: Missing one bullet point. <p> The two points are: make the stock price to a reasonable market range; and attract more investors to increase trade volume. <!--SR:!2026-09-23,504,408!2027-06-10,718,428-->
