## week 2 lecture 2

- time: 2024-09-12T13:30:00+08:00/2024-09-12T14:50:00+08:00
- [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md)
  - [financial accounting § principles](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md#principles) ::: relevant and timely information, faithful representation, separate entity, time period, going-concern, stable monetary unit, mixed-attribute measurement <!--SR:!2024-09-17,1,237!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / relevant and timely information ::: Record only information that affects decision, and before a decision that is relevant to said information is to be made. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / faithful representation ::: The record is complete, neutral, and accurate. This is a cornerstone of financial reporting and professional ethics. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / separate entity ::: Financial reporting is for the entity (the company), not owners of it. Managers are the _agents_ who operate the entity, a _legal person_, which is owned by the stockholders, the _principal_. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / time period ::: It refers to the reporting period. It can be monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. Interim reports are reported in between annual financial reports. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-19,3,257-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / [going concern](../../../../general/going%20concern.md) ::: The business is assumed to survive in the forseeable future, or at least long enough to meet its contractual obligations in the next reporting period. It is a basic but essential assumption. Otherwise, financial statements are prepared under the _liquidation basis_ of accounting, which is different from the basis we are learning. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / stable monetary unit ::: Also known as the _measuring unit principle_. It assumes changes in the purchasing power of measurement units are insufficiently important to require adjustment to financial statements, i.e. no adjustment for inflation and deflation. This does not apply during hyperinflation, and a different measurement must be used (see _mixed-attribute measurement_ below). <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / mixed-attribute measurement ::: Different measurement models may be applied to different assets and liabilities. There are two models: historical cost (value at the time of transaction), and fair value (value at the time of reporting). This is to be covered in ACCT 3010 and ACCT 3020. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
- [balance sheet](../../../../general/balance%20sheet.md)
  - [§ public business entities structure](../../../../general/balance%20sheet.md#public%20business%20entities%20structure)
- [asset](../../../../general/asset.md) ::: any resource, tangible or intangible, that can be used to produce positive economic value; economic resource with probable future benefits <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [§ asset](../../../../general/asset.md#asset)
- [liability](../../../../general/liability%20(financial%20accounting).md) ::: value that an entity is expected to deliver in the future to satisfy a present obligation arising from past events; probable future sacrifices of economic resources <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-19,3,257-->
  - [§ liability](../../../../general/liability%20(financial%20accounting).md#liability)
- [equity](../../../../general/equity%20(finance).md) ::: ownership interest in property that may be offset by debts or other liabilities; stockholder's equity: financing provided by owners and business operations <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [§ equity](../../../../general/equity%20(finance).md#equity)
- [revenue](../../../../general/revenue.md) ::: total amount of income by the sale of goods or services related to the company's operations; increase in assets or settlement of liabilities from ongoing operations <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [§ revenue](../../../../general/revenue.md#revenue)
  - [revenue](../../../../general/revenue.md) / gain ::: increase in assets or settlement of liabilities from peripheral activities (side activities) <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
- [expense](../../../../general/expense.md) ::: any specific outflow of cash or other valuable assets from a person or company to another person or company; decrease in assets or increase in liabilities from ongoing operations <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [§ expense](../../../../general/expense.md#expense)
  - [expense](../../../../general/expense.md) / loss ::: decrease in assets or increase in liabilities from peripheral activities (side activities) <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
- [consolidated financial statement](../../../../general/consolidated%20financial%20statement.md) (CFS) ::: a financial statement in which the parent company and all its subsidiaries are presented as those of a single economic entity <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
- [balance sheet](../../../../general/balance%20sheet.md)
  - [balance sheet](../../../../general/balance%20sheet.md) / elements ::: titles, name of the financial statement, reporting period or point in time, currency and basis of monetary unit, assets (in decreasing/increasing liquidity), liabilities (in decreasing/increasing maturity) <!--SR:!2024-09-19,3,257!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [balance sheet](../../../../general/balance%20sheet.md) / missing elements ::: unrecorded but valuable assets, such as internally generated goodwill (only recorded during acquitions of the company) <!--SR:!2024-09-19,3,257!2024-09-20,4,277-->
    - [balance sheet](../../../../general/balance%20sheet.md) / missing elements / unrecorded liabilities ::: Unrecorded liabilities, in particular leases (e.g. temporary contract to use others' equipment for a cost), have been forbidden because of US GAAP-ASC 842 (2018-12-15) and IFRS/HKFRS 16 (2019-01-01). <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
      - [balance sheet](../../../../general/balance%20sheet.md) / missing elements / unrecorded liabilities / examples ::: off-balance-sheet financing, i.e., obligations that are not reported as liabilities on the balance sheet; e.g., cash outflows of aircraft operating leases were not reported as debt on balance sheet <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
- accounting evolution ::: Accounting practices are always updating. For example, lease transactions have moved from a classification approach to a recognition approach. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - accounting evolution / classification approach ::: There are 2 main types called _operating leases_ and _finance leases_ (and a related type called as _sale-leasebacks_). The former may not appear in the balance sheet, while the latter allows the lessee (the entity who has the temporary right to use) to claim depreciation. <!--SR:!2024-09-19,3,257!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - accounting evolution / recognition approach ::: Now, most leases are required to be recorded. At commencement, the asset "right-of-use" is debited while the liability "lease liabilities" is credited. At year end, "lease liability" is debited while the asset "cash/bank" is credited. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
    - accounting evolution / recognition approach / [income statement](../../../../general/income%20statement.md) ::: At year end, the expense "depreciation" is recorded (and debited in the balance sheet) while the asset "accumulated depreciation" is credited in the balance sheet. This depreciates the asset "right-of-use". <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
- [financial transaction](../../../../general/financial%20transaction.md)
  - [accounting equation](../../../../general/accounting%20equation.md) ::: assets (A) = liabilities (L) + stockholders' equity (SE) <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [financial transaction](../../../../general/financial%20transaction.md) / principles ::: Each transaction affects _at least_ two accounts. The account names and change direction (debit or credit) are identified. Ensure that the account equation holds after a transaction. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [accounting equation](../../../../general/accounting%20equation.md) / A restaurant buys meat patties for $6&nbsp;000 in cash. ::: A, L, and SE do not change at all. The only change is that the amount under two accounts in A changed in opposite direction, i.e. transferred from the cash asset account to the inventory asset account. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [accounting equation](../../../../general/accounting%20equation.md) / A restaurant buys meat patties for $6&nbsp;000 _on credit_ (promise to pay later). ::: A increases by $6&nbsp;000, and L increases by $6&nbsp;000, balancing the accounting equation. Upon settlement of the liability (fulfilled the promise to pay), A decreases by $6&nbsp;000, and L decreases by $6&nbsp;000, still balancing the accounting equation. Overall, A, L, and SE do not change. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
- [chart of accounts](../../../../general/chart%20of%20accounts.md) ::: list of financial accounts and their identifiers, grouped into categories <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [chart of accounts](../../../../general/chart%20of%20accounts.md) / groups ::: as an example: assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity, revenues, expenses <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [chart of accounts](../../../../general/chart%20of%20accounts.md) / assets ::: Accounts with "receivable" in the title are __always__ assets. Prepaid expenses is __always__ an asset. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [chart of accounts](../../../../general/chart%20of%20accounts.md) / liabilities ::: Accounts with "payable" and "unearned" in the title are __always__ liabilities. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [chart of accounts](../../../../general/chart%20of%20accounts.md) / revenues ::: Account titles are typically formed by joining their source and then the word "revenue". <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
  - [chart of accounts](../../../../general/chart%20of%20accounts.md) / expenses ::: Account titles are typically formed by joining their source and then the word "expense". The account for inventory sold is typically titled "Cost of Goods Sold". <!--SR:!2024-09-20,4,277!2024-09-20,4,277-->
- [financial transaction](../../../../general/financial%20transaction.md)
