## week 2 lecture 2

- time: 2024-09-12T13:30:00+08:00/2024-09-12T14:50:00+08:00
- [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md)
  - [financial accounting § principles](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md#principles) ::: relevant and timely information, faithful representation, separate entity, time period, going-concern, stable monetary unit, mixed-attribute measurement
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / relevant and timely information ::: Record only information that affects decision, and before a decision that is relevant to said information is to be made.
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / faithful representation ::: The record is complete, neutral, and accurate. This is a cornerstone of financial reporting and professional ethics.
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / separate entity ::: Financial reporting is for the entity (the company), not owners of it. Managers are the _agents_ who operate the entity, a _legal person_, which is owned by the stockholders, the _principal_.
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / time period ::: It refers to the reporting period. It can be monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. Interim reports are reported in between annual financial reports.
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / [going concern](../../../../general/going%20concern.md) ::: The business is assumed to survive in the forseeable future, or at least long enough to meet its contractual obligations in the next reporting period. It is a basic but essential assumption. Otherwise, financial statements are prepared under the _liquidation basis_ of accounting, which is different from the basis we are learning.
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / stable monetary unit ::: Also known as the _measuring unit principle_. It assumes changes in the purchasing power of measurement units are insufficiently important to require adjustment to financial statements, i.e. no adjustment for inflation and deflation. This does not apply during hyperinflation, and a different measurement must be used (see _mixed-attribute measurement_ below).
  - [financial accounting](../../../../general/financial%20accounting.md) / mixed-attribute measurement ::: Different measurement models may be applied to different assets and liabilities. There are two models: historical cost (value at the time of transaction), and fair value (value at the time of reporting). This is to be covered in ACCT 3010 and ACCT 3020.
