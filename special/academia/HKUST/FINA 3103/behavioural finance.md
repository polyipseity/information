{@{__Behavioral finance__}@} applies {@{psychological biases observed in human behavior}@} to {@{financial markets}@}. These approaches are {@{largely data‑driven}@}, lacking {@{a formal underlying theory or microfoundation}@}, yet they explain {@{many real‑world phenomena that traditional models miss}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

{@{Biases arise along}@} two dimensions: {@{how information is processed and how decisions are subsequently made and acted upon}@}. For instance, an investor might {@{misinterpret a company’s earnings release}@} due to {@{selective attention}@}, illustrating {@{bias in information processing}@}. Similarly, the same investor could {@{overreact to that interpretation}@} when deciding whether to {@{buy or sell}@}, demonstrating {@{bias in decision making and subsequent behavior}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

## motivation

{@{The efficient‑market hypothesis}@} provides the {@{benchmark against which we evaluate investment strategies}@}. However, real investors often {@{fail to process information correctly}@}. {@{The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)}@} assumes {@{all market participants share a homogeneous view}@}, yet in practice {@{different investors hold diverse perspectives and exhibit varying degrees of rationality}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-02-28,4,270-->

Behavioral bias permeates {@{nearly every market anomaly that standard models struggle to explain}@}. While the approach lacks {@{a firm micro‑theoretical foundation}@} and it is difficult to isolate {@{which specific bias dominates in any given situation}@}, empirical evidence consistently shows that {@{a combination of biases—such as loss aversion, reference dependence, endowment and disposition effects}@}—shapes {@{investor behaviour and drives deviations from efficient‑market predictions}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

## projection bias

{@{_Projection bias_}@} is the {@{systematic tendency for people to project their current state onto future events}@}. In {@{a daily‑life experiment by Read‑van Leeuwen (1998)}@}, office workers were asked whether {@{they would choose an unhealthy snack}@} if it arrived {@{_a week later_}@}. {@{Those who felt hungry at the time}@} chose {@{the unhealthy option 78% of the time}@}, whereas {@{those who were satiated}@} did so {@{only 42% of the time}@}—demonstrating that {@{a person’s present hunger influences future food choices}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

In markets, projection bias manifests through {@{weather‑dependent product preferences}@}. Busse et al. (2013) found that on {@{hot days convertible cars and houses with pools sell more than expected}@}, while snowy days reduce sales of {@{4‑wheel‑drive vehicles}@}. The authors plotted {@{residuals of vehicle sales against mean temperature}@}, revealing a {@{strong positive relationship for convertibles in warm quarters}@} and the {@{opposite for 4‑WD cars}@}. This shows that {@{investors’ present weather expectations influence asset demand}@} even when {@{such factors should be priced out}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

Projection bias also underlies {@{_momentum_ or _extrapolation bias_}@}: investors tend to {@{buy stocks that have performed well recently}@} and {@{sell those that have performed poorly}@}, expecting {@{past performance to continue}@}. {@{The Baker and Wurgler (2006) study of U.S. equities from 1927–2008}@} reported {@{a 12‑month subsequent excess return of 6% for the best performers versus −7.5% for the worst}@}, illustrating {@{the persistent momentum effect}@}. Stocks that are {@{difficult to evaluate (young, unconventional, volatile, etc.)}@} are especially affected by {@{sentiment}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

## overconfidence

{@{Overconfidence}@} has two main facets: {@{overoptimism and overprecision}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

{@{_Overoptimism_}@} is {@{overestimating one’s ability or future performance}@}. _Svenson (1981)_ found that {@{93 % of subjects believed their driving skill exceeded the median}@}, while _Weinstein (1980)_ reported {@{underestimation of the likelihood of adverse events such as hospitalization}@}. _Overprecision_ is {@{overestimating the precision of one’s estimates}@}. _Buehler‑Griffin‑Ross (1994)_ showed that {@{participants underestimated how long a project would take to finish}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

In financial markets, {@{overconfidence leads to excessive trading}@}. {@{Overoptimistic investors}@} tend to {@{pick the wrong assets}@}, while {@{overprecise investors}@} {@{trade too often}@}; in both cases {@{returns rarely exceed transaction costs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

Odean (1999) examined {@{163&nbsp;000 trades from a discount brokerage}@} to test whether investors' {@{overconfidence causes them to trade too often and lose money}@}. The study found that {@{the average round‑trip cost was 5.9%}@}. The study also calculated {@{average percent returns for securities bought versus sold}@}, looking at horizons of {@{84, 252 and 504 trading days after the transaction}@}. Using {@{bootstrapped empirical distributions}@}, the null hypotheses that {@{purchases earn at least 5.9% more than sales (N1)}@} or that {@{purchases earn at least as much as sales (N2)}@} were both rejected with {@{p‑values of 0.001 or less}@}, showing that {@{stocks bought by investors earned significantly lower subsequent returns than those sold}@}. This pattern is consistent with {@{overoptimistic traders who pick the wrong stocks}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

## inattention

{@{Attention}@} is a {@{limited resource}@}; people {@{miss features when focusing elsewhere}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

{@{A taxi‑driver study}@} estimated {@{labor costs by counting the time the meter ran}@}, showing that drivers incur {@{substantial costs while “cruising” for passengers}@}—an example of {@{attention cost}@}. Uber can help by {@{automatically looking for passengers}@}. In auctions, if bidders {@{ignore part of an asset’s information}@}, prices {@{deviate from fundamentals}@}. In {@{online marketplaces such as e‑Bay}@}, bidders often {@{overlook subtle features that can affect value}@}. In {@{retail markets}@}, {@{the “left‑digit” effect}@} shows that buyers {@{focus on leading digits}@}; for example, $59 is {@{perceived much lower than $60}@}. In {@{the used‑car market}@}, Lacetera et al. (2012) showed that {@{perceived mileage jumps at multiples of 10&nbsp;k miles}@} because drivers {@{rarely notice exact counts}@}; the model predicts {@{step‑wise drops in value at these thresholds}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

A similar attention bias {@{appears in financial markets}@}. Bernard-Thomas (1989) documented the {@{post‑earnings announcement drift}@}, where prices continue to {@{move after an initial news shock}@}, reflecting {@{delayed absorption of information}@}. Fuberman and Rgev (2001) studied how investors’ {@{inattention shaped the price of EntreMed}@}, a biotech firm that {@{announced promising cancer research in October–November 1997}@}. The stock briefly {@{rose on 28 Nov 1997 when the announcement appeared in _Nature_}@}, but only {@{surged to its peak on 4 May 1998}@} after {@{almost the same story was front‑page news in the _New York Times_}@}. {@{A sharp decline}@} followed on {@{12 Nov 1998 when the _Wall Street Journal_ reported a failed replication}@}. The pattern shows that {@{market participants did not react immediately to the first press release and instead overreacted later}@}, illustrating how {@{delayed attention can distort price dynamics}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

Finally, Cohen and Frazzini (2011) illustrated {@{_"subtle link"_ inattention}@}. When {@{Callaway Golf (golf retail) announced a downgrade}@}, Coastcast’s (golf manufacturer) stock {@{did not fall immediately and only fell later despite having direct relation}@}, because investors {@{failed to notice the connection between the two firms}@}. This shows that {@{incomplete view of the market can lead to mispricing}@} when news about {@{one firm that affects other related firms only affects the stock of that one firm immediately}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

### inattention model

To model {@{inattention in financial markets, Della Vigna (2009)}@} modeled {@{an asset whose value $V=v+o$}@}. {@{An inattentive investor}@} perceives {@{$\hat V = v+(1-a)o$}@}, where {@{$a\in[0,1]$ measures the degree of inattention}@}: $a=0$ is {@{full attention and $a=1$ is total ignorance}@}. {@{Della Vigna and Pollet (2009) applied this idea to stocks}@}: if investors see {@{only a fraction of a firm’s earnings shock $o$}@}, their short‑run return is {@{$(1-a)o/v$; the long‑run return equals $o/v$}@}. Empirical estimates give {@{$a=0.456$ on non‑Fridays}@} and {@{$a=0.59$ on Fridays}@}, indicating {@{greater inattention when people are distracted}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

## framing

Humans judge {@{outcomes by comparing alternatives}@}; {@{a change in how options are presented—_framing_}@}—can {@{alter choices}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-02-28,4,270-->

In marketing, {@{the same price of $1&nbsp;200}@} can appear {@{more attractive}@} when the "Buy" button is {@{more prominent than the "No Thanks" button}@}, or when {@{a spam‑blocker’s effectiveness}@} is framed {@{positively ("96% spam free") rather than negatively ("4% spam")}@}. The framing that highlights {@{the positive side tends to increase purchase intent}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

In {@{public policy}@}, framing {@{influences risk perception}@}. {@{A survey during a pandemic}@} asked participants whether they preferred a plan that {@{guarantees 200 lives saved or one that offers a 33% chance of saving 600 lives versus a 66% chance of none}@}. {@{72% chose the guaranteed option}@}, illustrating how {@{a loss‑averse population interprets identical expected values}@} {@{differently depending on the wording}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

{@{Corporate announcements}@} also {@{exploit framing}@}. Rather than disclosing {@{the final net income}@}, companies often present {@{earnings as “adjusted earnings” or “earnings before interest and tax”}@}. {@{Underwriters may describe}@} an IPO as having {@{a 70% success probability rather than a 30% failure chance}@}. {@{Shibasaki et al. (2008) found that _pro‑forma_ disclosures (i.e. predictions)}@} lead to {@{overreaction of about 1.5%}@}. {@{The choice of reference point}@}—whether {@{the company’s past performance or industry averages}@}—is crucial in determining {@{how investors react}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-02-28,4,270!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

## prospect theory

{@{Kahneman and Tversky (1979) introduced prospect theory}@} to capture how {@{people actually choose under uncertainty}@}. The theory defines {@{utility over _changes_ from a reference point $r$}@}: {@{an outcome $x$ yields $U(x-r)$}@}. {@{This _reference dependence_}@} explains why investors care {@{more about the difference between current wealth and a benchmark than about absolute wealth itself}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

{@{Two core features}@} emerge: {@{_loss aversion_, where losses loom larger than equivalent gains}@}, and {@{_diminishing sensitivity_, with a concave value function over gains but a convex one over losses}@}. For instance, consider an investor deciding whether to keep {@{a stock worth \$1&nbsp;000}@} or sell it for {@{a 50‑percent chance of receiving \$2&nbsp;000 versus nothing}@}, illustrating {@{risk-aversion (choosing the former) due to diminishing sensitivity}@}. {@{The same payoff structure}@} framed as a loss—losing {@{\$1&nbsp;000 or 50-percent chance of losing \$2&nbsp;000 versus nothing}@}—illustrates {@{risk-seeking (choosing the latter) due to diminishing sensitivity}@}. Meanwhile, {@{loss aversion}@} simply says, given {@{the same amount of gain or loss}@}, losses are {@{negatively valued more than how gains are positively valued}@}: it could be {@{two times or even more}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

{@{Prospect theory}@} also accounts for {@{_reference dependence_ in corporate transactions}@}. {@{Baker, Pan and Wurgler (2012) showed that the price an acquirer offers}@} is often {@{anchored to the target’s 52‑week high $P_{52}$}@}. Their empirical analysis revealed {@{a clustering of merger premiums around $P_{52}$}@}, indicating that negotiators treat {@{recent highs as a psychological reference when setting deal terms}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

### endowment and disposition effects  

{@{The _endowment effect_, first highlighted in laboratory experiments}@}, shows that }{@{ownership inflates perceived value}@}. In one study participants {@{given mugs valued them at an average of \$7.12}@}, while those who {@{did not own a mug bid only \$2.87}@}; {@{the resulting trade volume}@} was below {@{10% (the market would clear with about 50% trade volume if loss aversion were absent)}@}. It is related to prospect theory, as participants valued {@{a mug based on if they owned a mug or not, rather than the absolute value of a mug}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->

{@{The _disposition effect_—selling winners early and holding losers}@}—mirrors {@{this bias}@}. {@{Investors lock in gains}@} because they evaluate {@{outcomes relative to their purchase price}@}, yet they {@{hesitate to realize a loss}@} for fear that {@{the pain of losing outweighs the pleasure of gaining}@}, leading to {@{systematic under‑reaction to new information}@}. Both effects stem from {@{the reference‑dependent valuation central to prospect theory}@} and demonstrate how {@{real traders depart from rational expectations}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280!2026-03-01,4,280-->
