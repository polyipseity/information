- [investment](../../../../general/investment.md) ::@:: It is traditionally defined as the "commitment of resources into something expected to gain value over time". <p> \(__this course__: Allocate _resources_ between _time_ and _states_.\)
  - investment / motivation ::@:: You want to get more _resources_. Investment allows you to do so in the future. However, there is also _uncertainty_. <p> All of these can be modeled using _utility_, which measures _satisfaction_ and incorporates resource value, risk, time value, etc. Then, we want to _maximize utility_.
- [finance](../../../../general/finance.md) ::@:: It refers to monetary resources and to the study and discipline of money, currency, assets and liabilities.
  - finance / fields ::@:: 3 main fields: asset pricing, corporate finance, market microstructure
    - finance / fields / asset pricing ::@:: Calculate asset _fair price_. <p> examples: Black–Scholes–Merton model \(a mathematical model\)
    - finance / fields / corporate finance ::@:: Calculate _firm value_ and decision making based on it. <p> examples: Modigliani–Miller theorem \(capital structure irrelevance principle\)
    - finance / fields / market microstructure ::@:: Relation between _market quality_ and environment, mechanisms, trading rules, etc.
- FINA 3103
  - FINA 3103 / objectives ::@:: Investigate asset pricing and market \(micro\)structure. Invest _wisely_ under different market structures, different trading rules, and uncertainty.
- [security](../../../../general/security%20(finance).md) ::@:: It is a tradable financial asset. The term commonly refers to any form of financial instrument, but its legal definition varies by jurisdiction.
  - security / assets ::@:: 2 main categories: safe assets, risky assets
    - security / assets / safe assets ::@:: bank savings, corporate bonds \(AAA\), government bonds, etc.

  - security / type of holder ::@:: retail: members of the public investing personally, other than by way of business <br/> wholesale: by financial institutions acting on their own account, or on behalf of clients
  - security / trading by individuals ::@:: bank savings: direct, easy \(open a bank account\) <br/> bonds: via _secondary markets_ and _designated dealers_ <br/> crypto: direct \(setup a crypto wallet\) <br/> stocks, derivatives: via _brokers_, e.g. Robinhood, SoFi, etc.
- [order book](../../../../general/order%20book.md) ::@:: It is the list of orders \(manual or electronic\) that a trading venue \(in particular stock exchanges\) uses to record the interest of buyers and sellers in a particular financial instrument.
- [order](../../../../general/order%20(exchange).md) ::@:: It is an instruction to buy or sell on a trading venue such as a stock market, bond market, commodity market, financial derivative market or cryptocurrency exchange.
  - order / types ::@:: 3 main types: conditional order, market order, limit order
  - order / market order ::@:: It is a buy or sell order to be executed immediately at the _current market_ prices.
  - order / limit order ::@:: It is an order to buy a security at no more than a specific price, or to sell a security at no less than a specific price \(called "or better" for either direction\).
  - order / conditional order ::@:: It is any order other than a limit order which is executed only when a specific condition is satisfied.
- [stock exchange](../../../../general/stock%20exchange.md) ::@:: \(__this course__: "on exchange"\) It is an exchange where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell securities, such as shares of stock, bonds and other financial instruments.
  - stock exchange / advantages ::@:: facilities liquidity, maintains the current market price, provides transparency
- [alternative trading system](../../../../general/alternative%20trading%20systen.md) \(ATS\) ::@:: \(__this course__: "off exchange"\) It is a US and Canadian regulatory term for a non-exchange trading venue that matches buyers and sellers to find counterparties for transactions.
- [dark pool](../../../../general/dark%20pool.md) ::@:: \(__this course__: "off exchange"\) It is a private forum \(alternative trading system or ATS\) for trading securities, derivatives, and other financial instruments.
- [market microstructure](../../../../general/market%20microstructure.md) ::@:: It is a branch of finance concerned with the details of how exchange occurs in markets.
- [risk–return spectrum](../../../../general/risk–return%20spectrum.md) ::@:: It is the relationship between the amount of return gained on an investment and the amount of risk undertaken in that investment. The more return sought, the more risk that must be undertaken.
  - risk–return spectrum / examples ::@:: gambling: high return \(if you win\), high risk \(of losing\) <br/> saving: low return, low-to-no risk
- [risk aversion](../../../../general/risk%20aversion.md) ::@:: It is the tendency of people to prefer outcomes with low uncertainty to those outcomes with high uncertainty, even if the average outcome of the latter is equal to or higher in monetary value than the more certain outcome.
  - risk aversion / examples ::@:: receive \$1 with certainty vs. receive either \$0 or \$2 with equal probability \(50%\)
- [risk-seeking](../../../../general/risk-seeking.md) ::@:: It is a person who has a preference _for_ risk.
  - risk-seeking / people ::@:: While most investors are considered risk averse, one could view casino-goers as risk-seeking.
- [risk neutral preferences](../../../../general/risk%20neutral%20preferences.md) ::@:: They are preferences that are neither risk averse nor risk seeking.
  - risk neutral preferences / decision making ::@:: A risk neutral party's decisions are not affected by the degree of uncertainty in a set of outcomes, so a risk neutral party is indifferent between choices with equal expected payoffs even if one choice is riskier.
- [utility](../../../../general/utility.md) ::@:: It is a measure of a certain person's satisfaction from a certain state of the world.
  - utility / motivation ::@:: It can model _expected return_ and _risk_ together.
- [modern portfolio theory](../../../../general/modern%20portfolio%20theory.md) \(MPT\) ::@:: It is a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk.
  - modern portfolio theory / motivation ::@:: To avoid \(diversifiable\) risk or control risk–return tradeoff by assembling a portfolio \(combination of assets\) optimally.
  - modern portfolio theory / intuition ::@:: Assume there is a stock with low return. Now consider two other stocks, stock A and stock B, both with equally high return. Stock A moves with the low-return stock. Stock B moves _opposite_ to the low-return stock. <p> Combining the low-return stock with stock A does not reduce risk \(variance, volatility\), because they have _similar_ risk factors. Combining it with stock B instead reduces risk \(variance, volatility\), resulting in _risk diversification_ due to their _different_ risk factors.
- [asset pricing](../../../../general/asset%20pricing.md) ::@:: It refers to the formal development of the principles used in pricing, together with the resultant models.
  - asset pricing / return, risk ::@:: Asset price affects return and risk, mostly via capital gain/loss.
  - asset pricing / motivation ::@:: To find the _efficient_/_fair_ price of an asset, which we assume the actual price of the asset will _eventually_ approach.
  - asset pricing / concepts ::@:: arbitrage, friction \(causing slight price differences in practice\), law of one price, market efficiency, etc.
- [arbitrage](../../../../general/arbitrage.md) ::@:: The practice of taking advantage of a difference in prices in two or more markets – striking a combination of matching deals to capitalize on the difference, the profit being the difference between the market prices at which the unit is traded.
  - arbitrage / effect ::@:: Arbitrage has the effect of causing prices of the same or very similar assets in different markets to converge.
- [law of one price](../../../../general/law%20of%20one%20price.md) ::@:: In the absence of trade frictions \(such as transport costs and tariffs\), and under conditions of free _competition_ and price flexibility \(where no individual sellers or buyers have power to manipulate prices and prices can freely adjust\), _identical goods_ sold at _different locations_ should be sold for the _same price_ when prices are expressed in a common currency.
  - law of one price / mechanism ::@:: This law is derived from the assumption of the inevitable _elimination of all arbitrage_.
- [efficient-market hypothesis](../../../../general/efficient-market%20hypothesis.md) \(EMH\) ::@:: It is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information.
  - efficient-market hypothesis / implication ::@:: A direct implication is that it is impossible to "beat the market" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information.
  - efficient-market hypothesis / intuition ::@:: Suppose you know some private information on a stock. You buy or sell the stock. Its price changes due to your action, reflecting the private information.
  - efficient-market hypothesis / reality ::@:: Grossman-Stiglitz paradox, irrationality, etc.
- [Grossman-Stiglitz paradox](../../../../general/Grossman-Stiglitz%20paradox.md) ::@:: It argues perfectly informationally efficient markets are an impossibility since, if prices perfectly reflected available information, there is no profit to gathering information, in which case there would be little reason to trade and markets would eventually collapse.
- [behavioural finance](../../../../general/behavioural%20finance.md) ::@:: It is the study of the influence of psychology on the behaviour of investors or financial analysts. It assumes that investors are not always rational, have limits to their self-control and are influenced by their own biases.
- efficient-market hypothesis
  - efficient-market hypothesis / reality
    - efficient-market hypothesis / reality / reasons ::@:: framing \(e.g. effect of salience\), information, luck, sophistication, skills, etc.
- [performance appraisal](../../../../general/performance%20appraisal.md) ::@:: It is a periodic and systematic process whereby the job performance of an employee is documented and evaluated.
  - performance appraisal / finance ::@:: need to separate the skill of portfolio manager from luck
- [fixed income](../../../../general/fixed%20income.md) ::@:: It refers to any type of investment under which the borrower or issuer is obliged to make payments of a fixed amount on a fixed schedule.
- [derivative](../../../../general/derivative%20(finance).md) ::@:: It is a contract between a buyer and a seller. The derivative can take various forms, depending on the transaction, but every derivative has the following four elements: ...
  - derivative / elements ::@:: tradeable item, future act, future act price, future act time
    - derivative / elements / tradeable item ::@:: an item \(the "underlier"\) that can or must be bought or sold, e.g. commodity, event, financial asset, intangible good, natural condition index, etc.
    - derivative / elements / future act ::@:: a future act which must occur \(such as a sale or purchase of the underlier\)
    - derivative / elements / future act price ::@:: a price at which the future transaction must take place
    - derivative / elements / future act time ::@:: a future date by which the act \(such as a purchase or sale\) must take place
- market microstructure
  - market microstructure / concepts ::@:: fragmented markets, number of exchanges in a country or region, trading speed, transparency, etc.
  - market microstructure / measures ::@:: liquidity: How easy is it to trade assets? <br/> price discovery: How fast does price reacts to news?
- [high-frequency trading](../../../../general/high-frequency%20trading.md) \(HFT\) ::@:: It is a type of algorithmic automated trading system in finance characterized by high speeds, high turnover rates, and high order-to-trade ratios that leverages high-frequency financial data and electronic trading tools.
  - high-frequency trading / latency arbitrage ::@:: Assume there are two assets that _theoretically_ should always have the same price in two distinct locations. In practice, one asset may update its price slightly later \(by a few milliseconds or even nanoseconds\), which can be exploited by high-frequency trading. <p> This shows trading speed matters. It matters so much that dedicated communication channels to exchanges with extremely low latency are built and improved.-
- [decentralized finance](../../../../general/decentralized%20finance.md) \(DeFi\) ::@:: It provides financial instruments and services through smart contracts on a programmable, permissionless blockchain. This approach reduces the need for intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks.
  - decentralized finance / technologies ::@:: blockchain, crypto, etc.
  - decentralized finance / advantages ::@:: democratize finance, efficient \(in some aspects\), robust, etc.
  - decentralized finance / decentralized exchanges \(DEX\) ::@:: They are a type of cryptocurrency exchange, which allow for either direct peer-to-peer, or Automated Market Maker \(AMM\) liquidity pool cryptocurrency transactions to take place without the need for an intermediary. The lack of an intermediary differentiates them from centralized exchanges \(CEX\).
    - decentralized finance / decentralized exchanges / examples ::@:: PancakeSwap, Uniswap, etc.
