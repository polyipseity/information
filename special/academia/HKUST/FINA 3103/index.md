Stock A moves with the low-return stock. Stock B moves _opposite_ to the low-return stock. <p> Combining the low-return stock with stock A does not reduce risk \(variance, volatility\), because they have _similar_ risk factors. Combining it with stock B instead reduces risk \(variance, volatility\), resulting in _risk diversification_ due to their _different_ risk factors. <!--SR:!2025-12-03,61,310!2025-12-03,61,310-->

- [arbitrage](../../../../general/arbitrage.md) ::@:: The practice of taking advantage of a difference in prices in two or more markets – striking a combination of matching deals to capitalize on the difference, the profit being the difference between the market prices at which the unit is traded. <!--SR:!2025-12-05,63,310!2025-12-03,61,310-->

  - efficient-market hypothesis / intuition ::@:: Suppose you know some private information on a stock. You buy or sell the stock. Its price changes due to your action, reflecting the private information. <!--SR:!2025-12-05,63,310!2025-11-18,45,290-->

- [Grossman-Stiglitz paradox](../../../../general/Grossman-Stiglitz%20paradox.md) ::@:: It argues perfectly informationally efficient markets are an impossibility since, if prices perfectly reflected available information, there is no profit to gathering information, in which case there would be little reason to trade and markets would eventually collapse. <!--SR:!2025-12-08,65,310!2025-11-29,58,310-->
- [behavioural finance](../../../../general/behavioural%20finance.md) ::@:: It is the study of the influence of psychology on the behaviour of investors or financial analysts.

This has the effect of reversing any profit or loss made on the securities. The initial cash deposited by the trader, together with the amount obtained from the sale, serve as collateral for the loan. <!--SR:!2025-10-25,19,350!2025-10-25,19,350-->
    - margin / short selling / net value ::@:: The net value—the difference between the cash amount and the value of loan security—is initially equal to the amount of one's own cash used. <!--SR:!2025-10-23,17,350!2025-10-24,18,350-->
    - margin / short selling / margin ::@:: $$\text{margin} = \frac {\text{account equity} } {\text{loan security market value} } \times 100\% \,,$$ where account equity is the market value of the assets \(i.e. cash or securities you have put in as collateral, and cash you have obtained by selling the loan security\) in your account subtracted by the market value of the loan security. <!--SR:!2025-10-23,17,347!2025-10-18,12,327-->
    - margin / short selling / interpretation ::@:: Indeed, when the loan security market value rises, the margin decreases, and vice versa. This is because account equity decreases by the rise and loan security market value increases by the rise. <!--SR:!2025-10-25,19,350!2025-10-19,13,330-->
