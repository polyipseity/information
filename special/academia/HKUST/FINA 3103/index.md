- [investment](../../../../general/investment.md) ::@:: It is traditionally defined as the "commitment of resources into something expected to gain value over time". <p> \(__this course__: Allocate _resources_ between _time_ \(sacrifice now to get something later\) and _states_ \(current commitment of money\).\)
  - investment / motivation ::@:: You want to get more _resources_. Investment allows you to do so in the future. However, there is also _uncertainty_. <p> All of these can be modeled using _utility_, which measures _satisfaction_ and incorporates resource value, risk, time value, etc. Then, we want to _maximize utility_.
- [finance](../../../../general/finance.md) ::@:: It refers to monetary resources and to the study and discipline of money, currency, assets and liabilities.
  - finance / fields ::@:: 3 main fields: asset pricing, corporate finance, market microstructure

  - order / limit order ::@:: It is an order to buy a security at no more than a specific price, or to sell a security at no less than a specific price \(called "or better" for either direction\). \(annotation: __Important__. "No more than" and "no less than" includes "equals to".\)
  - order / conditional order ::@:: It is any order other than a limit order which is executed only when a specific condition is satisfied.
- [stock exchange](../../../../general/stock%20exchange.md) ::@:: \(__this course__: "on exchange"\) It is an exchange where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell securities, such as shares of stock, bonds and other financial instruments.
  - stock exchange / advantages ::@:: facilities liquidity, maintains the current market price, provides transparency
- [alternative trading system](../../../../general/alternative%20trading%20systen.md) \(ATS\) ::@:: \(__this course__: "off exchange"\) It is a US and Canadian regulatory term for a non-exchange trading venue that matches buyers and sellers to find counterparties for transactions.
- [dark pool](../../../../general/dark%20pool.md) ::@:: \(__this course__: "off exchange"\) It is a private forum \(alternative trading system or ATS\) for trading securities, derivatives, and other financial instruments.

- [risk–return spectrum](../../../../general/risk–return%20spectrum.md) ::@:: It is the relationship between the amount of return gained on an investment and the amount of risk undertaken in that investment. The more return sought, the more risk that must be undertaken.
  - risk–return spectrum / examples ::@:: gambling: high return \(if you win\), high risk \(of losing\) <br/> saving: low return, low-to-no risk
- [risk aversion](../../../../general/risk%20aversion.md) ::@:: It is the tendency of people to prefer outcomes with low uncertainty to those outcomes with high uncertainty, even if the average outcome of the latter is equal to or higher in monetary value than the more certain outcome.
  - risk aversion / examples ::@:: receive \$1 with certainty vs. receive either \$0 or \$2 with equal probability \(50%\)
- [risk-seeking](../../../../general/risk-seeking.md) ::@:: It is a person who has a preference _for_ risk.
  - risk-seeking / people ::@:: While most investors are considered risk averse, one could view casino-goers as risk-seeking.
- [risk neutral preferences](../../../../general/risk%20neutral%20preferences.md) ::@:: They are preferences that are neither risk averse nor risk seeking.
  - risk neutral preferences / decision making ::@:: A risk neutral party's decisions are not affected by the degree of uncertainty in a set of outcomes, so a risk neutral party is indifferent between choices with equal expected payoffs even if one choice is riskier.
- [utility](../../../../general/utility.md) ::@:: It is a measure of a certain person's satisfaction from a certain state of the world.
  - utility / motivation ::@:: It can model _expected return_ and _risk_ together.

  - modern portfolio theory / intuition ::@:: Assume there is a stock with low return. Now consider two other stocks, stock A and stock B, both with equally high return. Stock A moves with the low-return stock. Stock B moves _opposite_ to the low-return stock. <p> Combining the low-return stock with stock A does not reduce risk \(variance, volatility\), because they have _similar_ risk factors. Combining it with stock B instead reduces risk \(variance, volatility\), resulting in _risk diversification_ due to their _different_ risk factors.
- [asset pricing](../../../../general/asset%20pricing.md) ::@:: It refers to the formal development of the principles used in pricing, together with the resultant models.
  - asset pricing / return, risk ::@:: Asset price affects return and risk, mostly via capital gain/loss.

  - arbitrage / effect ::@:: Arbitrage has the effect of causing prices of the same or very similar assets in different markets to converge.
- [law of one price](../../../../general/law%20of%20one%20price.md) ::@:: In the absence of trade frictions \(such as transport costs and tariffs\), and under conditions of free _competition_ and price flexibility \(where no individual sellers or buyers have power to manipulate prices and prices can freely adjust\), _identical goods_ sold at _different locations_ should be sold for the _same price_ when prices are expressed in a common currency.
  - law of one price / mechanism ::@:: This law is derived from the assumption of the inevitable _elimination of all arbitrage_.
- [efficient-market hypothesis](../../../../general/efficient-market%20hypothesis.md) \(EMH\) ::@:: It is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information.
  - efficient-market hypothesis / implication ::@:: A direct implication is that it is impossible to "beat the market" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information.
  - efficient-market hypothesis / intuition ::@:: Suppose you know some private information on a stock. You buy or sell the stock. Its price changes due to your action, reflecting the private information.
  - efficient-market hypothesis / reality ::@:: Grossman-Stiglitz paradox, irrationality, etc.
- [Grossman-Stiglitz paradox](../../../../general/Grossman-Stiglitz%20paradox.md) ::@:: It argues perfectly informationally efficient markets are an impossibility since, if prices perfectly reflected available information, there is no profit to gathering information, in which case there would be little reason to trade and markets would eventually collapse.
- [behavioural finance](../../../../general/behavioural%20finance.md) ::@:: It is the study of the influence of psychology on the behaviour of investors or financial analysts.

- [fixed income](../../../../general/fixed%20income.md) ::@:: It refers to any type of investment under which the borrower or issuer is obliged to make payments of a fixed amount on a fixed schedule.
- [derivative](../../../../general/derivative%20(finance).md) ::@:: It is a contract between a buyer and a seller. The derivative can take various forms, depending on the transaction, but every derivative has the following four elements: ...
  - derivative / elements ::@:: tradeable item, future act, future act price, future act time
    - derivative / elements / tradeable item ::@:: an item \(the "underlier"\) that can or must be bought or sold, e.g. commodity, event, financial asset, intangible good, natural condition index, etc.

    - derivative / elements / future act time ::@:: a future date by which the act \(such as a purchase or sale\) must take place
- market microstructure
  - market microstructure / concepts ::@:: fragmented markets, number of exchanges in a country or region, trading speed, transparency, etc.
  - market microstructure / measures ::@:: liquidity: How easy is it to trade assets? <br/> price discovery: How fast does price reacts to news?
- [high-frequency trading](../../../../general/high-frequency%20trading.md) \(HFT\) ::@:: It is a type of algorithmic automated trading system in finance characterized by high speeds, high turnover rates, and high order-to-trade ratios that leverages high-frequency financial data and electronic trading tools.
  - high-frequency trading / latency arbitrage ::@:: Assume there are two assets that _theoretically_ should always have the same price in two distinct locations. In practice, one asset may update its price slightly later \(by a few milliseconds or even nanoseconds\), which can be exploited by high-frequency trading. <p> This shows trading speed matters. It matters so much that dedicated communication channels to exchanges with extremely low latency are built and improved.
- [decentralized finance](../../../../general/decentralized%20finance.md) \(DeFi\) ::@:: It provides financial instruments and services through smart contracts on a programmable, permissionless blockchain. This approach reduces the need for intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks.
  - decentralized finance / technologies ::@:: blockchain, crypto, etc.
  - decentralized finance / advantages ::@:: democratize finance, efficient \(in some aspects\), robust, etc.
  - decentralized finance / decentralized exchanges \(DEX\) ::@:: They are a type of cryptocurrency exchange, which allow for either direct peer-to-peer, or Automated Market Maker \(AMM\) liquidity pool cryptocurrency transactions to take place without the need for an intermediary. The lack of an intermediary differentiates them from centralized exchanges \(CEX\).
    - decentralized finance / decentralized exchanges / examples ::@:: PancakeSwap, Uniswap, etc.

  - government auction / government bonds ::@:: The government holds periodic _auctions_ to sell bonds to _primary dealers_ \(PD\), which are usually large financial institutions. They are _obligated_ to bid a certain amount to stabilize bond issuance. <p> Small investors can only buy said bonds _directly_ via PDs or _indirectly_ from secondary markets.
- [secondary market](../../../../general/secondary%20market.md) ::@:: It is the financial market in which previously issued financial instruments such as stock, bonds, options, and futures are bought and sold.
  - secondary market / vs. primary market ::@:: The initial sale of the security by the issuer to a purchaser, who pays proceeds to the issuer, is the primary market. All sales after the initial sale of the security are sales in the secondary market.

- order book
- order
  - order / types
  - order / limit order
- order book
  - order book / limit order book ::@:: It accumulates limit orders. They are removed when a matching trade is executed or canceled by the user.
- order
  - order / limit order
    - order / limit order / priority ::@:: Better prices are matched and executed first. Then orders that are placed earlier are matched and executed first.
    - order / limit order / liquidity ::@:: In general, by stating the intentions of traders, liquidity is provided. <p> But traders can also take away liquidity by placing a limit order that can be satisfied by orders in the limit book when it is received, which are called _marketable_ limit orders.
  - order / market order
    - order / market order / limit order ::@:: Can be treated as a limit order with negative infinite ask price \(ensures instant sell if there are enough buyers\) or positive infinite bid price \(ensures instant buy if there are enough sellers\).
    - order / market order / liquidity ::@:: It takes away liquidity by consuming orders in the limit order book.
- [bid–ask spread](../../../../general/bid–ask%20spread.md) ::@:: A type of _transaction cost_. It is the difference between the prices quoted \(either by a single market maker or in a limit order book\) for an immediate sale \(ask\) and an immediate purchase \(bid\).
  - bid–ask spread / bid price ::@:: The price a market dealer or maker is willing to buy. Investor's \(your\) sale price. Usually lower than the ask price.
  - bid–ask spread / ask price ::@:: The price a market dealer or maker is willing to sell. Investor's \(your\) purchase price. Usually higher than the bid price.
  - bid–ask spread / liquidity ::@:: The size of the bid–ask spread in a security is one measure of the liquidity of the market and of the size of the transaction cost. If the spread is 0 then it is a frictionless asset.
  - bid–ask spread / midpoint ::@:: $$\frac {\text{bid price} + \text{ask price} } 2$$ <p> Sometimes, it may be used as the fair price of an asset.
  - bid–ask spread / market depth ::@:: It is the quantity offered at a specific price based on the limit order book. <p> It must increase as the price moves away from the midpoint \(in either direction\), as the number of executable limit orders are _accumulated_.
  - bid–ask spread / quoted price ::@:: Typically the quoted price is the last execution price, which is neither the bid price, ask price, nor midpoint price.
- order
  - order / conditional order
  - order / stop order ::@:: It is an order to buy or sell a stock once the price of the stock reaches a specified price, known as the __stop price__. When the stop price is reached, a stop order becomes a market order. <p> \(__this course__: If the stop order is triggered, it becomes either a market order or limit order.\)
    - order / stop order / buy-stop order ::@:: A buy-stop order is entered at a stop price above the current market price. Investors generally use a buy-stop order to limit a loss, or to protect a profit, on a stock that they have sold short.
    - order / stop order / sell-stop order ::@:: A sell-stop order is entered at a stop price below the current market price. Investors generally use a sell-stop order to limit a loss or to protect a profit on a stock that they own.
    - order / stop order / note ::@:: A buy-stop order waits for the price to go _above_ \(excluding _equal to_\), not _below or equal to_ the stop price to buy. Otherwise, it would be a buy-limit order instead. The same goes for sell-stop order. <p> \(__this course__: If the stop order is triggered, it becomes either a market order or limit order.\)

If margin is 50%, then leverage is 2, i.e. any _percentage_ gains or losses are magnified by 2 times.
  - margin / short selling ::@:: It refers to the selling of securities that the trader does not own, borrowing them from a broker, and using the cash as collateral. This has the effect of reversing any profit or loss made on the securities. The initial cash deposited by the trader, together with the amount obtained from the sale, serve as collateral for the loan.
    - margin / short selling / net value ::@:: The net value—the difference between the cash amount and the value of loan security—is initially equal to the amount of one's own cash used.
    - margin / short selling / margin ::@:: $$\text{margin} = \frac {\text{account equity} } {\text{loan security market value} } \times 100\% \,,$$ where account equity is the market value of the assets \(i.e. cash or securities you have put in as collateral, and cash you have obtained by selling the loan security\) in your account subtracted by the market value of the loan security.
    - margin / short selling / interpretation ::@:: Indeed, when the loan security market value rises, the margin decreases, and vice versa. This is because account equity decreases by the rise and loan security market value increases by the rise.

- topic: interest rate; compound interest; holding period return; expected return; variance; normal distribution
- [interest rate](../../../../general/interest%20rate.md) ::@:: It is the amount of interest due per period, as a proportion of the amount lent, deposited, or borrowed. Interest rate periods are ordinarily a year and are often annualized when not.
  - interest rate / lending ::@:: It is the cost a borrower pays to a lender, expressed as a percentage of the loan amount (e.g., borrowing \$1&nbsp;000 at 10% yields a \$100 interest payment).
  - interest rate / nominal rate, real rate ::@:: Rates can be quoted nominally or in real terms; the relationship $1+r = \frac{1+i}{1+\pi}$ links real rate $r$, nominal rate $i$, and inflation $\pi$, which approximates to $r ≈ i - π$ when rates are small and periods are short.
    - interest rate / nominal, real / difference ::@:: Understanding this distinction is essential for comparing returns across time periods and adjusting for purchasing‑power changes.
  - interest rate / factors ::@:: money demand and supply, government actions, monetary policy, credit risk, etc.
    - interest rate / factors / money demand and supply ::@:: The supply of loanable funds (household savings funneled through banks) meets the demand from businesses needing capital, forming the core market mechanism.
    - interest rate / factors / government actions ::@:: They—spending levels, bond issuance, and net fiscal position—shift the supply‑demand balance by altering how much money is available for borrowing.
    - interest rate / factors / monetary policy ::@:: It and market expectations, particularly anticipated inflation, also influence lenders' required compensation; higher expected inflation typically raises nominal rates.
    - interest rate / factors / credit risk ::@:: It (default probability) adds a further premium: riskier borrowers demand higher yields to compensate lenders.
    - interest rate / factors
  - interest rate / risk-free rate ::@:: It represents the return on an investment with virtually no default risk. It serves as a baseline for evaluating other assets: any excess return above this benchmark is considered a "risk premium".
    - interest rate / risk-free rate / proxies ::@:: Government securities such as US Treasury bills or Secured Overnight Financing Rate \(SOFR\) are common proxies. The choice of risk‑free asset matters—using a T‑Bill rate versus SOFR can slightly shift the computed premiums and ratios.
  - interest rate / annual percentage rate \(APR\) ::@:: It specifies the nominal yearly rate, but compounding frequency (daily, e.g. bank accounts; monthly, e.g. leases, mortgages; semi‑annual, e.g. US bonds) determines the effective yield over a year.
  - interest rate / effective annual rate \(EAR\) ::@:: It is calculated as $(1 + r/n)^n - 1$, where $r$ is APR and $n$ the number of compounding periods per year; \(assuming nonnegative rates\) EAR ≥ APR when compounding occurs more than once annually, and vice versa.
    - interest rate / effective annual rate / example ::@:: A one‑year CD with a 5% APR compounded semi‑annually yields an EAR of 5.0625%, slightly higher than the stated rate.
- [compound interest](../../../../general/compound%20interest.md) ::@:: It is interest accumulated from a principal sum and previously accumulated interest. It is the result of reinvesting or retaining interest that would otherwise be paid out, or of the accumulation of debts from a borrower.
  - compound interest / continuous compounding ::@:: When the number of compounding periods per year increases without limit, continuous compounding occurs, in which case the effective annual rate approaches an upper limit of _e_<sup>_r_</sup> − 1. Continuous compounding can be regarded as letting the compounding period become infinitesimally small, achieved by taking the [limit](../../../../general/limit%20(mathematics).md) as _n_ goes to [infinity](../../../../general/infinity.md).
    - compound interest / continuous compounding / formula ::@:: The amount after _t_ periods of continuous compounding can be expressed in terms of the initial amount _P_<sub>0</sub> as: $$P(t)=P_{0}e^{rt}.$$ Or, finding the interest rate $r$: $$r = \frac 1 t \ln \left(\frac {P_t} {P_0}\right) \,.$$
    - compound interest / continuous compounding / use ::@:: It simplifies many formulas (e.g., exponential growth models) and often approximates real‑world scenarios for high‑frequency financial instruments.
- [holding period return](../../../../general/holding%20period%20return.md) \(HPR\) ::@:: It is the return on an asset or portfolio over the whole period during which it was held. It is one of the simplest and most important measures of investment performance.
  - holding period return / calculation ::@:: HPR is the change in value of an investment, asset or portfolio over a particular period. It is the entire gain or loss, which is the sum [income](../../../../general/income.md) and [capital gains](../../../../general/capital%20gains.md), divided by the value at the beginning of the period. <p> &emsp; __HPR__ = \(End Value - Initial Value\) / Initial Value <p> where the End Value includes income, such as dividends, earned on the investment: $$HPR_{n}\ =\ {\frac {\text{Income}+P_{n+1}-P_{n} }{P_{n} } }$$ where $P_{n}$ is the value at the start of the holding period and $\text{Income}+P_{n+1}$ is the total value at the end of the holding period.
  - holding period return / annualization ::@:: Often, we want the return over an year instead of some arbitrary periods. We assume, whenever you receive a cash flow, you _immediately reinvest_ it into the same asset. <p> Then, for each cash flow in the year, calculate the non-annual returns. Then simply multiply them altogether.
  - holding period return / random variable ::@:: Both price changes and dividend payouts are uncertain; thus HPR is a random variable whose distribution reflects market volatility.
    - holding period return / random variable / estimation ::@:: Time‑series data (monthly or yearly returns) allow empirical estimation of expected return and risk measures.
- [expected return](../../../../general/expected%20return.md) ::@:: It  on a financial investment is the expected value of its return (of the profit on the investment). It is a measure of the center of the distribution of the random variable that is the return.
  - expected return / formula ::@:: For a finite set of economic states $\{s_i\}$, each with probability $p(s_i)$ and asset return $r(s_i)$, the expected return is $\mu = \sum p(s_i) r(s_i)$.
  - expected return / interpretation ::@:: This weighted average captures forward‑looking investor expectations; higher probabilities for favorable states elevate $\mu$.
  - expected return / formula
    - expected return / formula / example ::@:: Example calculation: a portfolio with returns 20%, 5%, 1% and -10% in four scenarios (probabilities 5%, 40%, 40%, 15%) yields $\mu = 1.9\%$.
  - expected return / moment ::@:: It is the _1st_ moment of return as a random variable.
- [variance](../../../../general/variance.md) ::@:: __Variance__ is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean of a random variable. It is often represented by $\sigma ^{2}$, $s^{2}$, $\operatorname {Var} (X)$, $V(X)$, or $\mathbb {V} (X)$.
  - variance / discrete random variable ::@:: The variance of a discrete random variable is $$\operatorname{Var}(X) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal X} \left((x - \mu)^2 p(x) \right) \,.$$ This is only defined if the above sum and $\mu$ exists, so it is possible for a discrete random variable to have undefined variance.
  - variance / standard deviation ::@:: Taking the square root gives standard deviation $\sigma$, often called volatility; larger $\sigma$ implies a wider spread of possible outcomes.
  - variance / example ::@:: Example calculation: a portfolio with returns 20%, 5%, 1% and -10% in four scenarios (probabilities 5%, 40%, 40%, 15%) yields $\mu = 1.9\%$. <p> The variance is $0.42\%$ \(alternatively expressed as $0.0042$ or $42\%\%$\) and SD is $6.5\%$, indicating moderate risk relative to the mean.
  - variance / percentage ::@:: When calculating variance or standard deviation, avoid using percentage. If you do use it, note the number for variance is in units of _double_ percent %%, where 1%% = 0.0001. <p> \(__this course__: Show the final answer of variance and SD in percentage.\)
  - variance / moment ::@:: It is the _2nd_ centralized moment of a random variable.
- [normal distribution](../../../../general/normal%20distribution.md) ::@:: The __normal distribution__ or __Gaussian distribution__ is important in statistics and is often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. Their importance is partly due to the central limit theorem. It is denoted $\mathcal N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, where $\mu \in \mathbb R$ is the mean and $\sigma^2 \in \mathbb R_{> 0}$ is the variance. <p> \(When you see $\mathcal N(0, 100)$, do not mistake the 100 as the standard deviation! It is the variance.\)
- [68–95–99.7 rule](../../../../general/68–95–99.7%20rule.md) ::@:: It is a shorthand used to remember the percentage of values that lie within an interval estimate in a normal distribution: approximately 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of the values lie within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean, respectively.
- variance
  - variance / interpretation ::@:: A lager standard deviation \($\sigma$\) indicates that realized values are more widely dispersed around the mean, meaning outcomes vary considerably from one another. When $\sigma$ equals zero, the outcome is certain and always equal to the mean, so any increase in $\sigma$ makes future returns increasingly unpredictable.
- expected return
  - expected return / estimation ::@:: With observed returns $(r_1,\dots,r_n)$, the sample mean $$\bar{r} = \frac{1}{n}\sum r_t$$ approximates expected return. <p> These plug‑in estimators are unbiased for large samples and form the basis for most portfolio calculations.
  - expected return / vs. realized return ::@:: From today's viewpoint, we look at _expected return_ \($\sigma$\) as a forward‑looking estimate of the average outcome and assess _risk_ through its variance or standard deviation \($\sigma^2, \sigma$\), assuming we know the return distribution. <p> In contrast, the _realized return_ is what actually occurred, measured after the fact; observing many past returns lets us infer the underlying distribution $p(s)$ and $r(s)$ and then use that empirical knowledge to predict future performance.
- variance
  - variance / estimation ::@:: With observed returns $(r_1,\dots,r_n)$,sample variance $$\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum (r_t - \bar{r})^2$$ estimates risk. \(__this course__: Use $n - 1$ instead of _n_ as the divisor.\) <p> These plug‑in estimators are unbiased for large samples and form the basis for most portfolio calculations.

## week 3 lecture

- datetime: 2025-09-16T15:00:00+08:00/2025-09-16T16:20:00+08:00, PT1H20M
- topic: skewness; kurtosis; two-moment decision model; risk premium; Sharpe ratio; value at risk
- [skewness](../../../../general/skewness.md) ::@:: It in probability theory and statistics is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean.
  - skewness / formula ::@:: $$\gamma_1 = \frac{E[(r-\mu)^3]}{\sigma^3}$$ A normal distribution is _symmetric_ and thus has zero skewness. <p> \(__this course__: $\sigma$ uses _unbiased_ estimator.\)
  - skewness / direction ::@:: Intuitively for graphs, a distribution is __left-skewed__ or __negative-skewed__ if _its tail is on the left_, and vice versa for __right-skewed__ or __positive-skewed__. Otherwise, it is __unskewed__. Intuitively for numbers, a distribution is left-skewed if its mean is on the left of (smaller than) its median, and vice versa for right-skewed. Otherwise, it is unskewed. (But actually, said intuition is very very wrong sometimes... See the item below.)
  - [skewness § relationship of mean and median](../../../../general/skewness.md#relationship%20of%20mean%20and%20median) ::@:: The above intuition is _usually_ correct if the distribution is unimodal. But in general, there are no direct relationships between skewness, mean, and median. Furthermore, an unskewed distribution is not necessarily symmetric. But its converse, a symmetric distribution is unskewed, is true.
  - skewness / interpretation ::@:: It indicates asymmetry: positive skew means rare big gains and common small losses; negative skew implies rare large losses and common small gains. <p> These moments help assess whether mean‑variance metrics fully capture an asset's risk profile.
  - skewness / moment ::@:: It is the normalized _3rd_ centralized moment of a random variable.
- [kurtosis](../../../../general/kurtosis.md) ::@:: It refers to the degree of tailedness in the probability distribution of a real-valued, random variable in probability theory and statistics.
  - kurtosis / formula ::@:: $$\gamma_2 = \frac{E[(r-\mu)^4]}{\sigma^4}$$ <p> \(__this course__: Use _excess kurtosis_ instead, even though the lecture slides call it simply "_kurtosis_". $\sigma$ uses _unbiased_ estimator.\)
  - kurtosis / excess kurtosis
    - kurtosis / excess kurtosis / formula ::@:: $$\gamma_2 = \frac{E[(r-\mu)^4]}{\sigma^4} - 3$$ A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3, thus an _excess_ kurtosis of 0. <p> \(__this course__: Use _excess kurtosis_ instead, even though the lecture slides call it simply "_kurtosis_". $\sigma$ uses _unbiased_ estimator.\)
    - kurtosis / excess kurtosis / interpretation ::@:: It gauges tail heaviness; excess kurtosis >&nbsp;0 signals fat tails and higher likelihood of extreme events than a normal distribution predicts. <p> These moments help assess whether mean‑variance metrics fully capture an asset's risk profile. <p> For example, positive excess kurtosis means variance/SD _underestimates_ extreme events.
  - kurtosis / moment ::@:: It is the normalized _4th_ centralized moment of a random variable.
- [two-moment decision model](../../../../general/two-moment%20decision%20model.md) ::@:: It is a model that describes or prescribes the process of making decisions in a context in which the decision-maker is faced with random variables whose realizations cannot be known in advance, and in which choices are made based on knowledge of two moments of those random variables.
  - two-moment decision model / names ::@:: mean-variance analysis \(__this course__: Uses the name _mean-variance investor_\)
  - two-moment decision model / assumptions ::@:: Investors focus on two attributes: expected return (higher is better) and variance/volatility (lower is preferable). Higher-order moments, e.g. skewness, kurtosis, are _ignored_. <p> The trade‑off assumption—"higher return comes with higher risk"—underpins many modern portfolio theories.
  - two-moment decision model / risk aversion ::@:: Risk‑averse investors will prefer assets or portfolios that maximize return for a given level of volatility.
  - two-moment decision model / moments ::@:: The two moments are almost always the mean—that is, the expected value, which is the first moment about zero—and the variance, which is the second moment about the mean (or the standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance).
- [risk premium](../../../../general/risk%20premium.md) ::@:: It is a measure of excess return that is required by an individual to compensate being subjected to an increased level of risk. It is used widely in finance and economics, the general definition being the expected risky [return](../../../../general/rate%20of%20return.md) less the [risk-free return](../../../../general/risk-free%20interest%20rate.md), as demonstrated by the formula below.
  - risk premium / formula ::@:: It is used widely in finance and economics, the general definition being the expected risky [return](../../../../general/rate%20of%20return.md) less the [risk-free return](../../../../general/risk-free%20interest%20rate.md), as demonstrated by the formula below. $$\text{risk premium}=E(r)-r_{f} \,,$$ where $E(r)$ is the risky expected rate of return and $r_{f}$ is the risk-free return.
  - risk premium / nature ::@:: The value of this forward‑looking \(unobservable\) figure is theoretical and depends on investors' risk assessments rather than observable market prices alone.
- [Sharpe ratio](../../../../general/Sharpe%20ratio.md) ::@:: It measures the performance of an investment such as a security or portfolio compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. <p> It represents the additional amount of return that an investor receives per unit of increase in risk. It provides a unitless measure of efficiency.
  - Sharpe ratio / name ::@:: It was named after William F. Sharpe, who developed it in 1966. He won the Nobel prize in 1990.
  - Sharpe ratio / formula ::@:: It is defined as the difference between the returns of the investment and the risk-free return, divided by the standard deviation of the investment returns: $$\text{SR} = \frac{\mu - r_f}{\sigma} \,.$$
  - Sharpe ratio / interpretation ::@:: A higher SR indicates better compensation per unit of risk; investors compare assets to choose those with superior SRs.
  - Sharpe ratio / example ::@:: With $r_f=4.3\%$, Apple's mean 6.5% and SD 8% give $\text{SR}_{AAPL} = \frac{2.2}{8} ≈ 0.275$; Amazon's mean 7.8% and SD 20% yield $\text{SR}_{AMZN} = \frac{3.5}{20} ≈ 0.175$. Apple offers a higher Sharpe ratio, suggesting better risk‑adjusted performance.
- [value at risk](../../../../general/value%20at%20risk.md) \(VaR\) ::@:: It is a measure of the risk of loss of investment/capital. It estimates how much a set of investments might lose (with a given probability), given normal market conditions, in a set time period such as a day.
  - value at risk / definition ::@:: It is the threshold loss value such that there is a specified probability $p$ (commonly 5% or 10%) that actual losses exceed it.
    - value at risk / definition / inversion ::@:: The probability level is about equally often specified as one minus the probability of a VaR break, so that one-day 5% VaR would be called a one-day 95% VaR instead. This generally does not lead to confusion because the probability of VaR breaks is almost always small, certainly less than 50%. <p> \(__this course__: We do not invert _p_.\)
  - value at risk / normal distribution ::@:: Under normality, VaR = $\bar{r} + z_p \hat{\sigma}$, where $z_{0.05} ≈ -1.65$ and $z_{0.01} = -2.33$; for non‑normal returns, empirical percentiles (e.g., Excel's `PERCENTILE`) compute VaR directly from data.
  - value at risk / example ::@:: For a portfolio with mean 2% and SD 5%, the 5%/95% VaR is $2 - 1.65 \times 5 ≈ -6.25\%$, meaning there's a 5% chance of losing more than 6.25%.
  - value at risk / non-normality ::@::
- interest rate
  - interest rate / risk-free rate
    - interest rate / risk-free rate / historical ::@:: Historical risk‑free rates have been slightly positive, reflecting real economic growth and inflation expectations.
  - interest rate / historical ::@:: Riskier assets generally deliver higher average returns to compensate for their volatility; this is observable across asset classes (equities vs bonds).
    - interest rate / historical / correlation ::@:: Returns on risky assets often move together—high correlation arises from shared macroeconomic drivers—yet they tend to be serially uncorrelated \(i.e. uncorrelated over short periods of time\), implying no predictable momentum or reversal patterns over short horizons.
