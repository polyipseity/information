__Investment funds__ pool money from many investors and place it in a diversified portfolio of securities.  The fund is managed by professional managers who decide how the assets are allocated; individual investors do not control the day‑to‑day choices.

In theory the optimal risky portfolio is the market portfolio; in practice investors access it through funds that track a broad index or by using ETFs such as VOO, which follows the S&P 500.  The _fair_ price of an asset is judged against its NAV for open‑end funds and against market demand for closed‑end and exchange‑traded products.

## net asset value

The value of a share in an _open-end fund_ is _usually_ (but not always) expressed through its _Net Asset Value_ (NAV): $$\text{NAV}=\frac{\$V-\$L}{N}$$ where $\$V$ is the total market value of assets, $\$L$ are liabilities and $N$ is the number of shares outstanding. If the fund trades on an exchange (some funds are not traded) its market price may differ from the NAV because it is set by supply and demand.

For example, a fund with \$50 million in assets, \$5 million in liabilities and one million shares has an NAV of $$\frac{50-5}{1}=45\text{ dollars per share}.$$

## asset under management

The _Asset Under Management_ (AUM) is the total market value of all securities that a fund manager oversees on behalf of investors: $$\text{AUM} = \text{market price} \times \text{\# outstanding shares} \,.$$  It reflects how large and influential a fund or asset‑management firm is, and it influences the firm’s ability to invest in different markets and to negotiate transaction costs.

A high AUM typically enables economies of scale, but it can also make it harder for a fund to buy or sell large positions without moving the market.  In practice, investors often look at AUM as one indicator of a manager’s track record and operational capacity when selecting an open‑end investment vehicle.

For example, BlackRock manages about $\$9.5$ trillion, Vanguard about $\$8.4$ trillion, and UBS around $\$4.4$ trillion; these figures illustrate the scale of the largest open‑end managers in the world.

## types

### open-end funds

Open‑end funds are investment companies that issue new shares whenever investors want to join and redeem existing shares when they wish to leave.  Because the number of outstanding shares is not fixed, the fund can adjust its size to accommodate inflows or outflows.  The price of a share in an open‑end fund is _usually_ (but not always) determined by its _Net Asset Value_ (NAV).  This rebalancing and transparent pricing make open‑end funds a common vehicle for investors who want diversified exposure without managing individual securities themselves.

_Exchange traded_ funds (ETFs), a special type of open‑end fund that trades like a stock, allow investors to buy and sell throughout the day.  VOO, for example, tracks the S&P 500 index and is bought on an exchange just as one would trade a regular share. As the fund trades on an exchange, the market price may deviate from NAV because it is set by supply and demand during the trading day.

In contrast, a traditional open‑end _mutual_ fund sells or redeems shares only once per day after the close, so its trading price equals the daily NAV. Large open‑end funds such as BlackRock, Vanguard and UBS manage trillions of dollars; they can issue or redeem shares at any time to keep the share count aligned with investor flows. For example, the AQR Long‑Short Equity N (QLENX) seeks capital appreciation by taking long positions in stocks expected to outperform and short positions in those expected to underperform, using value, momentum and quality factors.

### closed-end funds

A closed-end fund issues a fixed number of shares through an initial public offering.  After issuance the shares trade on exchanges and their market price is determined solely by supply and demand.  Because the share count is fixed, investors must find another buyer or seller when they wish to exit.

### exchange-traded funds

Exchange‑traded funds (ETFs) are open‑end investment vehicles that trade on exchanges like ordinary stocks.  A fund is created or redeemed through a small group of _Authorized Participants_ (APs) acting as market makers on the secondary market.  When market demand pushes an ETF’s price above its net asset value (NAV), APs arbitrage by buying the underlying securities, creating new ETF shares and selling them to the market; when the price falls below NAV they redeem (decrease) ETF shares in exchange for the underlying basket.  The non‑arbitrage relationship keeps the market price close to the underlying index price $p_{\text{ETF} }\approx p_{\text{SP} } $. For example, the Bank of Japan purchases Nikkei&nbsp;225 ETF to boost the underlying stock market.

ETFs usually have no management fee beyond the expense ratio, can be bought or sold throughout the day, and allow short sales and margin purchases.  However, their prices may diverge from NAV because they trade on supply and demand; a typical ETF can only be bought in whole shares, which introduces a small _spread_ cost and brokerage fee.

U.S. ETFs have expanded rapidly: net assets held by U.S. ETFs rose from about $400&nbsp;billion in the early 2000s to over $2 200 billion in 2014, while the number of distinct ETFs grew from roughly 200 to more than 1400.  The largest ETF issuers—BlackRock (iShares), State Street (SPDR), Vanguard, Invesco and others—control the bulk of assets under management; their flagship products such as SPY, GLD or VWQ hold tens of billions in asset under management (AUM).

### real estate investment trusts

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) invest primarily in real‑estate assets such as retail centres, offices, or logistics facilities.  They can be open-end—priced by NAV once a day—or closed-end, where the market price reflects supply and demand.  An example is _Link REIT_, which is a Hong Kong based RETI that owns properties across Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai.

### hedge funds

Hedge funds resemble mutual funds but are typically private, accepting only wealthy or institutional investors.  They enjoy fewer regulatory constraints, allowing strategies such as short selling and high leverage, and they rarely disclose their holdings.  Famous examples include _Soros Fund_, _Citadel_ and _DE Shaw_.

## taxation

Investment funds are subject to a _pass‑through_ tax rule: all capital and income gains generated by the underlying portfolio flow directly to shareholders.  For instance, if a $100 k ETF portfolio turns over 50 % in a year, the $50 k of turnover produces capital gains that must be paid by investors; the fund does not absorb the tax.

Mutual funds and ETFs differ mainly in how they are priced and taxed.  Mutual fund shares are bought or redeemed at the end‑of‑day NAV; if a redemption forces the fund to sell securities it may trigger a taxable gain that passes through to remaining investors.  ETFs, by contrast, trade continuously on an exchange.  When a selling pressure pushes the ETF price down, APs redeem shares and deliver the underlying assets in‑kind, so the fund itself does not generate capital gains for other holders.  

## management styles  

A fund manager may follow a _passive_ or an _active_ strategy.  Passive managers hold a diversified portfolio that mirrors a benchmark index and rarely change the allocation, aiming to match market returns rather than beat them.  Active managers seek out mispriced securities or forecast broad market movements; success depends on information advantages, skill and luck.  The choice of benchmark is crucial when evaluating performance.

## performance evaluation

Assessing past and future performance can be difficult because the appropriate benchmark is subjective and data may be limited for newer funds or managers.  Even if one manager appears to outperform, investors must decide whether that outperformance is sustainable or merely a statistical fluke before allocating all capital.  

Assessing a fund’s quality requires comparing its return to an appropriate benchmark while adjusting for risk.  A manager who consistently generates excess return after accounting for volatility or systematic exposure is regarded as skilled, whereas a high absolute return may simply reflect favourable market conditions rather than managerial talent.

### style analysis

To make meaningful comparisons, funds are first grouped by investment style—growth, value, active trading, and so on—so that only portfolios with comparable risk characteristics are evaluated together.  This classification is intuitive but relies on an informal definition of “style” and may overlook formal asset‑pricing relationships.

### risk-adjusted performance measures

There are five standard metrics used to evaluate a manager’s ability to turn risk into excess return: Sharpe ratio, Treynor measaure, Jensen's alpha, Modiliani–Modigliani measure, and information ratio.

_Sharpe ratio_ is defined as $$S_{p}=\frac{\bar r_{p}-r_f}{\sigma _{p} },$$ where $\bar r_{p}$ is the average portfolio return, $r_f$ the risk‑free rate and $\sigma _{p}$ the standard deviation of returns. Compared to Treynor measure, the ratio additionally evaluates the manager on _diversification_, as better diversification lowers standard deviation for a given return. _Example_: If a fund earns an annual return of $12\%$, faces a risk‑free rate of $2\%$ and has a volatility of $15\%$, its Sharpe ratio equals $(0.12-0.02)/0.15=0.67$.

_Treynor measure_ is defined as $$T_{p}=\frac{\bar r_{p}-r_f}{\beta _{p} },$$ where $\beta _{p}$ is the portfolio’s sensitivity to market movements.  The metric rewards a fund that earns excess return per unit of systematic risk.  The Sharpe ratio, by contrast, depends on total volatility; two funds with identical systematic risk but different idiosyncratic volatility can receive different Sharpe scores. A Treynor measure larger than that of the market implies superior fund performance than the CAPM benchmark, implying a positive $\alpha$.

_Jensen’s alpha_ is defined as $$\alpha _{p}=\bar r_{p}-\bigl(r_f+\beta _{p}(r_M-r_f)\bigr).$$ A positive $\alpha$ indicates performance beyond what CAPM would predict.  The formula appeared in Jensen’s seminal 1968 paper _“The Performance of Mutual Funds”_. Because $$T_{p}=\frac{\alpha _{p} }{\beta _{p} }+r_M-r_f,$$ a fund with a positive Jensen alpha automatically yields a Treynor measure larger than that of the market, and conversely a higher Treynor value implies a positive $\alpha$.

_Modiliani–Modigliani_ measure ($\mathbb M^2$) is defined as follows: Construct a hypothetical portfolio $p^{*}$ that mixes fund $p$ with the risk‑free asset so that its total volatility matches that of the market, $\sigma _{p^{*} }=\sigma _{M}$.  The resulting return $$\mathbb M_{2}=r_{p^{*} }-r_M$$ is equivalent to a Sharpe ratio, i.e. the fund is scaled such that its volatility matches that of the market; it was introduced in Modigliani & Modigliani’s 1981 paper _“The Theory of Investment Performance”_.

_Information ratio_ is defined as $$I_{p}=\frac{\alpha _{p} }{\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}\!\bigl(\varepsilon _{p}\bigr)} },$$ where $\varepsilon _{p}$ is the residual from a CAPM regression.  It measures how efficiently a manager turns idiosyncratic risk into excess return.

The metrics are useful but not definitive.  They assume normally distributed returns, constant exposure to systematic risk and that the benchmark truly represents the market.  Limited data for newer funds or illiquid assets further hampers accurate estimation of $\alpha$, $\beta$ and residual variance.  Consequently, investors should combine quantitative scores with qualitative factors such as fees, liquidity, regulatory constraints and historical consistency before committing capital.

### estimating the measures

All five metrics require estimates of $\beta _{p}$, $\alpha _{p}$ and residual variance.  A common approach is to run an ordinary‑least‑squares regression $$r_{p,t}-r_f=\alpha _{p}+\beta _{p}\bigl(r_{M,t}-r_f\bigr)+\varepsilon _{p,t},$$
and then plug the estimated coefficients into the formulas above.  The assumptions of CAPM—single‑factor, linearity and constant alphas and betas—underlie these calculations; violations can bias the results.

### market timing strategy

In practice, active managers may try to time the market by increasing their exposure when the market is rising and reducing it when it falls.  The idea is that a fund with a higher beta will earn more during up‑markets and less during down‑markets.  Although many studies find no consistent profit from timing, potentially due to efficient market hypothesis, the strategy is still widely discussed because it can generate large short‑term gains when the model works, yet it often carries frequent trading costs, tax consequences and the risk of mistiming.

A common econometric framework to test for market timing uses an augmented CAPM regression.  In Henriksson and Merton (1984 JoB), the return on fund $p$ is regressed against the excess return of the market $(r_{M,i}-r_f)$ and its interaction with a market‑timing dummy: $$r_{p,i}-r_f   =\alpha _{p}   +\beta_{p,1}\,(r_{M,i}-r_f)   +\beta_{p,2}\,(r_{M,i}-r_f)\,D_t   +\varepsilon_{p,t},$$ where $D_t=0$ when the market return is below the risk‑free rate and $D_t=1$ otherwise.  A statistically significant $\beta_{p,2}$ suggests that the fund’s exposure to systematic risk changes with the market state. If $\beta_{p,2}$ is positive, the manager appears to increase beta when the market performs well; a negative value indicates the opposite. The earlier Treynor–Mazuy model (1966) uses a similar specification but without the dummy term: $$r_{p,i}-r_f   =\alpha _{p}   +\beta_{p,1}\,(r_{M,i}-r_f)   +\beta_{p,2}\,(r_{M,i}-r_f)^2   +\varepsilon_{p,t}\,,$$ with the interpretation of $\beta_{p,2}$ being similar with small differences outlined below.

Both regressions estimate the fund’s systematic exposure and any timing effect.  In the Henriksson‑Merton specification (1984 JoB) the market‑timing influence is captured by an interaction between the excess market return $(r_{M,i}-r_f)$ and a binary dummy $D_t$ that equals one when the market outperforms the risk‑free rate.  Consequently, $\beta_{p,2}$ measures how much additional beta a manager adds in up‑market periods; a positive coefficient means the fund’s systematic exposure rises when the market is doing well, whereas a negative value signals that the manager reduces exposure during strong markets.

The Treynor–Mazuy model (1966) replaces the interaction with a quadratic term $(r_{M,i}-r_f)^2$.  This functional form allows beta to vary continuously with the magnitude of the market return rather than only when it exceeds the risk‑free rate.  Because the squared term is always non‑negative, a positive coefficient implies that the fund’s sensitivity to the market grows as the market return becomes larger in either direction, whereas a negative coefficient would mean the exposure diminishes for extreme market moves.  Thus, while both regressions aim to detect timing behaviour, the first test focuses on a discrete “up‑market” regime, and the second examines a continuous, nonlinear relationship between beta and market performance.

When a fund shows a significant timing coefficient, its risk‑adjusted return can be higher than that of a pure CAPM benchmark.  However, the gains may simply reflect higher turnover and tax drag rather than skill.  Because the market‑timing hypothesis relies on a single‑factor model, it is vulnerable to omitted‑variable bias; alternative explanations such as sector rotation or macro factors often explain the same patterns.
