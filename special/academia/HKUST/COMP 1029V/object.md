# VBA object

A VBA class ~~is never~~ could be complete without teaching objects... But we will talk about it anyways.

## class

To create an object, one needs to first create a class. In VBA, we need to {{add a new module for each class under "Class Modules"}}. A class consists of {{attributes and methods}}:

```VB
Public HaHa As String
Public HeHe As Double

Sub Initialize(ByVal NewHaHa As String, ByVal NewHeHe As Double)
  HaHa = NewHaHa
  HeHe = NewHeHe
End Sub

Sub NoHeHe()
  HeHe = 0
End Sub
```

Then to create an object, one uses {{`New`. Also call the method that is intended to be the constructor if any, commonly called `Initialize`}}:

```VB
Dim HaHaObject As HaHaClass
Set HaHaObject = New HaHaObject
HaHaObject.Initialize "omg", 123 ' constructor is not part of the language natively
```

The above object stored under the `HaHaObject` variable is also called {{an _instance_ of the class `HaHaClass`}}.

## attribute

An attribute is declared like a {{[variable](basics.md#variable)}}.

## method

A method is declared like a {{[subroutine or function](subroutine%20and%20function.md)}}.

### constructor

VBA {{only supports constructors with no parameters by having a subroutine named `Class_Initialize`, but not parameterized constructors natively}}. However, we can emulate the latter by {{adding a subroutine that acts like a constructor and hopes the user remembers to call the constructor after creating the object}}. A better method is using {{the factory pattern, but it will not be introduced here}}. Using the example above:

```VB
Sub Initialize(ByVal NewHaHa As String, ByVal NewHeHe As Double)
  HaHa = NewHaHa
  HeHe = NewHeHe
End Sub
```
