## variable

Before using a variable, it needs to be {{declared using the keyword `Dim` first}}. The syntax is {{`Dim VariableName As Type`}}. You can also declare multiple variables in one line, like {{`Dim VariableName1 As Type1, VariableName2 As Type2`}}.

To assign variables, use {{the equals operator `=`, like `Variable = Value`}}. For object types (basically anything that are not simple types like numbers, strings, booleans), you need to {{prepend `Set` before the variable as well, like `Set ObjectVariable = Value`}}.

## types

Below are common data types:

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
from asyncio import gather as _gather
from itertools import chain as _chain
headers = "type", "description"
table = (
  ("`Boolean`", "Either `True` or `False`."),
  ("`Double`", "A floating point number with double precision (15 to 17 significant figures). One can effectively treat it as a decimal number for most purposes.",),
  ("`Integer`", "An integer from -2<sup>15</sup> = -32768 to 2<sup>15</sup>-1 = 32767.",),
  ("`Long`", "An integer from -2<sup>31</sup> = -2147483648 to 2<sup>31</sup>-1 = 2147483647.",),
  ("`Single`", "A floating point number with single precision (6 to 9 significant figures). One can effectively treat it as a decimal number for most purposes.",),
)
return _chain.from_iterable(await _gather(
  memorize_table(
    __env__.cwf_sects("2f02", "652a",),
    headers,
    table,
  ),
  memorize_map(
    __env__.cwf_sects(None, "3b1a", None,),
    items_to_map(*table),
  )
))
```

<!--pytextgen generate section="3b1a"--><!-- The following content is generated at 2024-03-07T00:04:17.302448+08:00. Any edits will be overridden! -->

- `Boolean`::Either `True` or `False`.
- `Double`::A floating point number with double precision (15 to 17 significant figures). One can effectively treat it as a decimal number for most purposes.
- `Integer`::An integer from -2<sup>15</sup> = -32768 to 2<sup>15</sup>-1 = 32767.
- `Long`::An integer from -2<sup>31</sup> = -2147483648 to 2<sup>31</sup>-1 = 2147483647.
- `Single`::A floating point number with single precision (6 to 9 significant figures). One can effectively treat it as a decimal number for most purposes.

<!--/pytextgen-->

One cannot usually assign a value of a type to a variable {{declared with a different type}}:

```VB
Dim ADouble As Double, AnObject As Object
Set AnObject = 3.14 ' runtime error
ADouble = Range("A1") ' runtime error
ADouble = 3.14 ' okay
```

In some circumstances, the value can be {{implicitly converted to the type of the variable, though sometimes with loss of data}}:

```VB
Dim ALong as Long
ALong = 2.5 ' `ALong` is rounded to 2 as VBA uses banker's rounding
```

## output

To output things, we can use {{a message box by calling `MsgBox message[, icon][, title]`}}. `message` refers to {{the message, `icon`, by default no icon, refers to icon shown next to the message, and `title`, by default `Microsoft Excel`, is the title}}. If you want to specify a optional argument that is after another optional argument that you do not want to specify, leave the argument blank, like {{`MsgBox "message", , "title"`}}.

There are several icons. Some of them are {{`vbCritical`, `vbExclamation`, `vbInformation`, and `vbQuestion`}}.

## input

To accept user input, we can use {{an input box by calling `Input = InputBox(prompt[, title][, default])`}}. `prompt` refers to {{the message, `title`, by default `Microsoft Excel`, is the title, and `default`, by default empty, is the initial value in the input box. The user input is assigned to the variable `Input`}}. Similar to [output](#output), you can skip optional arguments by {{leaving it blank}}.

## parentheses

When calling subroutines or functions, sometimes we {{use parentheses `()`, sometimes we do not}}. We only use parentheses when {{we need to use the output of the called function, otherwise we do not}}. As subroutines have no output, {{calling them never needs parentheses}}. The only exception is when you need to {{use the output of a function providing no arguments (so includes having optional arguments only), then having parentheses or not are both okay}}.
