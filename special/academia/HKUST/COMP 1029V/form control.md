# Excel form control

We can use form controls to create {{user interface in spreadsheets}}. The other option is using {{the more flexible ActiveX controls, but they are unavailable on MacOS while form controls are}}. <!--SR:!2024-02-04,4,270!2024-02-04,4,270-->

Some examples of form control are {{`Button`, which is a button, and `ComboBox`, which is a dropdown selection list}}. <!--SR:!2024-02-04,4,270-->

## adding

Just read the Excel dialogs carefully.

## event

For a button control, the default macro that activates after clicking is {{`(form control name)_Click`}}. <!--SR:!2024-02-04,4,270-->
