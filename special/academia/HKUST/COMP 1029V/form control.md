# Excel form control

We can use form controls to create {@{user interface in spreadsheets}@}. The other option is using {@{the more flexible ActiveX controls, but they are unavailable on MacOS while form controls are}@}.

Some examples of form control are {@{`Button`, which is a button, and `ComboBox`, which is a dropdown selection list}@}.

## adding

Just read the Excel dialogs carefully.

## event

For a button control, the default macro that activates after clicking is {@{`(form control name)_Click`}@}.
