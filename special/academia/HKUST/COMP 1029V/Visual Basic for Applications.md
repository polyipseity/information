# Visual Basic for Applications

Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is a programming language {{based on Visual Basic and is designed for use in applications, like Microsoft Excel}}. <!--SR:!2024-02-04,4,270-->

## running

To run a VBA program, you need {{a trigger}}. In Excel, the trigger can be {{macros or events}}. For example, the event when the Excel file opens is {{`Workbook_Open`}}. <!--SR:!2024-02-04,4,270!2024-02-04,4,270!2024-02-05,4,279-->

## editing

To edit VBA code in an Excel file, use {{the VBA editor}}. How to edit then? Just press random buttons and learn for yourself. <!--SR:!2024-02-04,4,270-->

### macro

It is not necessary to {{write VBA code yourself for simple automation}}. You can {{record a macro and it will generate VBA code for you}}. If you open the VBA editor, you should see {{VBA code in a subroutine with a name same as the macro name}}. Text beginning from `'` to end of line {{are comments and are ignored}}. <!--SR:!2024-02-04,4,270!2024-02-04,4,270!2024-02-16,13,270!2024-02-04,4,270-->
