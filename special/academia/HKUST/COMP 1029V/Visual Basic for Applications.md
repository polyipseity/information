# Visual Basic for Applications

Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is a programming language {@{based on Visual Basic and is designed for use in applications, like Microsoft Excel}@}.

## running

To run a VBA program, you need {@{a trigger}@}. In Excel, the trigger can be {@{macros or events}@}. For example, the event when the Excel file opens is {@{`Workbook_Open`}@}.

## editing

To edit VBA code in an Excel file, use {@{the VBA editor}@}. How to edit then? Just press random buttons and learn for yourself.

### macro

It is not necessary to {@{write VBA code yourself for simple automation}@}. You can {@{record a macro and it will generate VBA code for you}@}. If you open the VBA editor, you should see {@{VBA code in a subroutine with a name same as the macro name}@}. Text beginning from `'` to end of line {@{are comments and are ignored}@}.
