# Excel spreadsheet

## concepts

- cell :: The boxes you see when you open a spreadsheet. It can contain a piece of data.
- range :: A bunch of cells.
- workbook :: The entire Excel file. A workbook can contain multiple worksheets.
- worksheet :: Like a piece of paper containing cells.

## cell

Every cell has a location. Its location is in the format of {{`(column)(row)`, where `(column)` starts from `A` to `Z`, and then `AA` to `ZZ`, and then etc., while `(row)` starts from `1` and increases forever}}.

Apart from location, cells and ranges can also have {{user-defined names}}. You can see all names in a workbook using {{the name manager}}.

## formula

Apart from inputting data into cells, cells can also {{compute}}. To do so, use {{[formulas](formula.md)}}.
