## cell

Every cell has a location. Its location is in the format of {{`(column)(row)`, where `(column)` starts from `A` to `Z`, and then `AA` to `ZZ`, and then etc., while `(row)` starts from `1` and increases forever}}. <!--SR:!2024-02-04,4,270-->

Apart from location, cells and ranges can also have {{user-defined names}}. You can see all names in a workbook using {{the name manager}}. <!--SR:!2024-02-04,4,270!2024-02-04,4,270-->
