# Classwork 1 : Identify errors

“It’s not a bug — it’s an undocumented feature.”

The following code includes several errors. Identify the errors and correct them so that the code can be compiled.

```C
#include <stdioh>

void main() {
  printf("Hello, World!")
  printf("Welcome to the first software tutorial!");

  return 0;
```

Your correct code should give the following output:

```console
Hello, World!
Welcome to the first software tutorial!
```
