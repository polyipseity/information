# The Curious Case of Ineffective Study Strategies

Despite decades-long research into study strategies in the literature, for whatever reason, most students continue to use ineffective study strategies frequently. This disconnection is a curious one.

To understand why, in the thesis "Instructor and student knowledge of study strategies" published on _Memory_ in 2016, Kayla Morehead et al. explores the role of instructors in students' study strategies.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> The authors note that there is a dearth of research into instructors on study strategies in the literature, even though instructors are important in disseminating study strategies. Therefore, they surveyed 300 undergraduates and 146 instructors at Colorado State University. The undergraduates were surveyed on their study practices, while the instructors were surveyed on how students should study. Both were asked to rate the two study strategies each in six scenarios, one empirically-validated while the other was not. To validate their findings, the authors compare students' response with prior research and find them to be highly consistent. Focusing on instructors, the authors find they are marginally better than students at identifying effective study strategies, and their views on study strategies are generally consistent with students. Finally, the authors suggest that instructors and students learn from the same pool of information and misinformation, and their ratings reflect study non-optimal strategies that are effective sometimes.

The fact that instructors are similar to students when it comes to study strategies is a surprising and worrying one. Generally speaking, instructors should have better academic knowledge than students so that they can teach the students well. When it comes to study strategies though, not so much, meaning the students have no good guidance when it comes to studying well. The authors above suggest that drawing from the same pool of information causes this. This begs the question: What makes study strategies different from other academic knowledge? It is not like other academic knowledge have separate information pools for students and instructors, especially in the age of the Internet.

Perhaps the problem is that knowledge about study strategies is _meta-knowledge_, meaning knowledge of knowledge itself. Schools do not deliberately teach meta-knowledge to students because they assume the students already have them. It's why we don't see schools for learning to learn. Thus, students can only learn about study strategies by themselves, whether from experience or the Internet, instead of from an authoritative source. Yet such learning is unreliable as the information most likely to reach students is anecdotal in nature. They are unlikely to go into the literature to find empirical studies to inform their study strategies. This might explain why students think highly of non-optimal study strategies that are effective sometimes. As for instructors, they were most likely once students learning to teach, and obtained their study strategies by themselves as well, accounting for their similarities to students with respect to study strategies.

If so, the problem becomes: Why does research in the literature fail to penetrate through the pool of information on study strategies? To both students and instructors, it is easy to think that study strategies are very rudimentary compared to other knowledge. After all, we study every day, how could we get studying wrong? Thus, we believe our peers or even ourselves are reliable sources to inform ourselves on study strategies. This is unfortunately incorrect, as shown by the many common pitfalls made by students when using study strategies.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> And so, this misinformation spreads from peers to peers without anyone pointing out the errors. Research in the literature is irrelevant to them because it is much less accessible and they see no need for a very authoritative source to inform their study strategies.

Then, how would one solve this worrying problem? It is clear that changes starting from students and instructors themselves are infeasible. Studying will always be too familiar for them to self-realize their study strategies have been non-optimal all along. Intervention at a higher level is needed, like changing the education curriculum to including teaching study strategies. This applies for instructors as well, like dedicated courses to retrain instructors on study strategies. Further research should focus more on disseminating effective study strategies in the literature to the wider public so that students' and instructors' study strategies can truly be improved.
