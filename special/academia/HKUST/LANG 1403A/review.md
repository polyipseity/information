### content

- rating: C

Let's start with some basic information. Most lessons are face-to-face, while the rest are self-directed lessons (SDL), which you only need to complete the graded SDL tasks online. Then, there are two ungraded group projects, academic blog (writing assignment 1, W1) and group video (video assignment 1, V1). Lastly, there are two graded individual projects, academic blog (writing assignment 2, W2) and individual multimodal video (video assingment 2, V2). The detailed requirements are below:

- W1: 400 Â± 50 words, unassessed
- V1: 1-2 minutes, unassessed
- W2: 800 Â± 50 words, 35% (written language, coherence, synthesis), reflection 3% by (meaningful) completion
- V2: 4-6 minutes, 40% (spoken language, coherence, synthesis, multimodality), reflection 2% by (meaningful) completion
- SDLs: complete all SDL lessons (13), two elective modules (2), and two quizzes on the school online library (3), 18 max, normalized to 20%, actual scores on the SDLs does not matter as long as it is not too ridiculous low

Overlength writing and video would mean your assignment would be assessed up to the limit, while underlength writing and video would decrease all of your assignment grade by a level. So don't go underlength and prefably keep your assignment not or slightly overlengthed.

The course is split into 3 units. Let's talk about them individually.

Unit 1 is about class logistics and narrowing on a research topic with groupmates. It tries to teach us that researching in a group consists of 8 steps: knowing thy teammates, understanding goals, choosing a topic, brainstorming, narrowing down your topic, developing key points, drafting and editing your work, and publishing your work. It is clearly preparing for the group projects V1 and W1.

Very well that you are trying to teach us how to research, but we all know how the actual reseach process looks like: procrastinating, realizing the deadline is tomorrow, burning midnight oil, and submitting your work just in time. Honestly, actual researching takes a lot of work and time and learning it can only be done if you are truly interested in the topic. Try looking up how much work a PhD candidate does.

Unit 2 is much longer and talks about academic writing. First, it teaches about summarizing and critizing sources. It tries to do that by pointing key things to note, having you write some summaries and critques of various text and discuss with your classmates. Nice attempt, but if you really want to improve on summarizing and critiquing, the exercises in the course are definitely not enough, and it's not like you are goint to do it seriously, right?

Next, it teaches multimodality. It does so by showing us professional videos and pointing out the techniques used inside. Of course you don't actually get to practice using those techniques for multimodality because... Well, imagine creating any effects in a professional video. How do I even get started? No, CLE will not teach you anything on this. Though at least they do provide some links to tutorials.

Lastly, it teaches us on making coherent arguments. Again, it does the same thing as that for summarizing and critizing sources, so I won't repeat it here again.

Unit 3 is all about making a video from your research. It teaches you on how to make ENGAGING videos. Well, yes, I definitely know videos need to be ENGAGING by adding colorful images and videos and having good scriptwriting and language, but how do I actual make such a video? As mentioned above, CLE just provides links, so either you have to learn some video editing or stick to some tool that you know well, usually a presentation tool. The tools that you know determines the ceiling of your video.

It also have some SDL lessons that teaches you on spoken language and synthesizing recommendations, and it's only marginally more helpful than the above.

Lastly, there is a lesson at the end where you get feedback for your V2 draft from your classmate and your teacher. It is ungraded and your best chance to improve your V2 grade. Otherwise, you will need to make those chances at improving your grades yourself by appointing one-to-one meetings with the teacher.

For the two graded assignments, there is also a reflection writing for each, carrying a 3%/2% meaningful completion mark. Use almost minimal effort on it, or maybe just write as you think. At least satisify the minimum word requirement. Going over the word limit is aokay.

You are allowed to use generative AI. Please do use them so that you won't be disadvantaged! I think it is best used for paraphrasing your text to be more natural. Especially good if English is not your native language.

On top of those SDLs, you also need to complete two elective modules out of four: presentation skills, online resources for language development, academic writing, and research skills. All four are available on Canvas right away, you just need to complete two or more. Mostly useless work except that it provides some links to resources that you can use. If you want the least work, choose online resources for language development and research skills.

And there's also two online library quizzes. It's mostly about how to use online libraries, citations, and plagiarism. Just more annoying work to do...

### teaching

- rating: B

Mrs. Farmer is a sweet British teacher... Caring enough to put comments on the CLE feedback website, even for the SDL assignment. Her grading is not too fishy and about normal, neither good nor bad. Though that won't do for my boringness in the lesson... sleepy ðŸ˜´

### grading

- rating: D

In this section, CLS stands for CLE. Because it really is CLS when it comes to grading.

FIrst, if you are trying to predict your grade from your current assignment grades by reading reviews, don't! Or at least you should expect the actual grade to be Â±3 subgrades of your expected grade after reading the reviews. For assignment grades and worse course grade compared to others. For example, compare these two reviews (CORE 1403A is the old course code):

- <https://ust.space/review/CORE1403A/view/8tSlJEW5n5aHV7PdEIlj3214UPQFecCz>: all SDL, 5 advanced, 2 exceptional/advanced, gets B+
- <https://ust.space/review/CORE1403A/view/dj4l29rv2U5fOCf1AAD9xSEUqzv5JvGO>: all SDL, 2 advanced/competent, 2 advanced, 3 exceptional/advanced, gets A

The reason is that the grades are adjusted for each section. If a section has too many good grades, grades are adjusted downwards, and vice versa. So you can think of the curve is for each section instead of for the entire course. So good luck having a good grade teacher but not a too-good grade teacher.

Aside, grading is more subjective than other courses, and perhaps some instructors give their grades based on their perception on you, so even more randomness... which is why it might as well be a lottery machine, it won't be much different. Maybe try swapping the sections with others, though you probably need to know of USTSPACE before the add-drop period... rare.

To conclude, the reason why grading is so CLS is the opposite of that of MATH: the grading for CLS is too adaptive and inconsistent, whereas the grading for MATH is consistent but too unadaptive because of absoute grading.

And the grading experience is very bad because it takes so freaking unnecessarily long to release your grade! Like it was released literally the start of the winter semester (2024-01-02) whereas the last assignment was submitted on the first of December (2023-12-01)... AHHHHHHH

Anyway, here are some strategies to help you. Complete all SDLs and reflection tasks because basically everyone else with a brain is doing it. Ideally, do them early so that you won't forget later. Check if you have missed any SDLs tasks like you have OCD. Use ChatGPT to paraphrase your text to make your text more native like. And don't trust everything what the course content says about grading, like "video editing is not assessed". Because how the hell do you think you can do multimodality, which is assessed, without any technical skills? And yes, really do improve your video editing skills. And go beyond, like animation (no, not PowerPoint animation), if you for some reason need CLS to pull up your CGA. Lastly, do look at the assignment grading rubrics and understand what CLS expects.

As an appendix and for statistical purporses, this is what would one approximately need to get A+ despite CLS grading for sweet LANG 2010H/2030H (in comparison, any passing grade in LANG 1404 can join the honor class):

- W2: written language: exceptional/advanced, coherence: exceptional, synthesis: exceptional/advanced, reflection: competent (3%)
- V2: spoken language: exceptional/advanced, coherence: exceptional, synthesis: exceptional, multimodality: exceptional, reflection: emerging (2%)
- SDL: activities: 13/13, library: 3/3, electives: 2/2

### workload

- rating: B

In comparison with LANG 1402 and LANG 1404, the workload of this course is comparatively low. Only two graded offline assignments are needed whereas LANG 1404 have 6 or 7 and LANG 1402 have speaking tasks. A bit annoying that there are also reflection for each graded task. However, the workload is high if you want to exert extra effort on each assignment, especially for the V2 assignment.

For ungraded ones, you can probably just do them with minimal effort, or not do it at all if you don't care about impression.

The same goes for attendance, you can skip all lessons if you don't care about impression (though I suspect this makes a much greater impression, so maybe don't). There is a scary score counter that records your attendance, but it is not graded *officially*. It is a relic from the past when attendance *officially* would affect your grade. It was left here to make people think they need to attend lessons psychologically, hehe. Though if you care about impression, please do attend all lessons so that it won't affect your grade *unofficially*, i.e. teacher disliking you and giving you worse grade.
