# Breaking Studying Mis-strategies

CAMERAPERSON: You seem to need help... Can I assist you?

PERSON: _Sign_... I have an exam tomorrow so I've been busy studying. But I can't seem to grasp the concepts. And I feel like I'm going to fail my exam... You can't really help.

CAMERAPERSON: Well... Good luck.

Have __you__ ever been in a situation like __this__? Studying __tirelessly__ before exams, yet failing to see the desired results __again__ and __again__? If so, this video is for __you__! We will explore the reasons __why__ your typical studying methods may __not__ be effective and suggest __ways__ to improve them. Let's get started!

(section: your typical studying methods)

For us students, we __really, really__ love to revise __before__ exams, driven by procrastination. __Procrastination__ is such a __common__ aspect of human nature that it has been referenced throughout history. As far back as __800 BC__, Greek poet Hedroid wrote, "a man who puts off work is always at hand-grips with ruin" (Thakkar, 2009). To combat this, it helps to understand why we should __avoid__ last-minute revisions and why we __still__ resort to them.

In the literature, last-minute revisions are __categorized__ as a study strategy called "__cramming__". Sommer's 1968 classical research defined cramming as a "__heavy burst__ of studying immediately before an exam which followed a __long__ period of __neglect__" (Sommer, 1968). Later in 1993, Vacha and McBride (1993) defined cramming as "__neglected__ studying for __three__ or more weeks" and then had a "__burst__ of study before the tests". You can observe both definitions highlight __two__ dimensions: an __intense burst__ of study referred to as "__cramming__" and the __neglect__ of studying in __other__ times, which we called "__procrastination__". This demonstrates to us how procrastination __leads__ to cramming. Another reason why we __still__ resort to cramming before exams is that it __does__ work! Albeit only in the __short-term__, as suggested by Crewe (1969) in 1969. Long-term though... is a __much__ different story. A 2001 article by two professors in Middle Tennessee State University found that __crammers__ experience __more__ depression, irrationality, and stress in the __long run__ (Brinthaupt & Chin, 2001). Moreover, numerous studies have shown __time and time__ again, cramming is __less__ effective than other __active__ study methods (Walck-Shannon, Rowell, & Frey, 2021). __Now__ we understand the reasons to avoid cramming. But telling you to "__just__ stop cramming" is pretty __useless__, so we will delve into this topic in depth later.

(section: active study methods)

Earlier, I mentioned "__active__ study methods", which have proven to be __more__ effective than cramming. What are __these__ methods? We can find clues from existing research. A cross-disciplinary team identified __twelve__ study strategies and categorized them as either __active__ or __passive__. For instance, "reading notes" is a __passive__ method, while "self-quizzed" is __active__. From examples shown on screen, we can infer that __active__ strategies need __knowledge__ application, whereas __passive__ ones do not. The same study also highlighted that __active__ study strategies present __challenges__ to us, enabling us to form __interconnected__ knowledge. In contrast, __passive__ ones are not __challenging__ enough to facilitate this process (Walck-Shannon, Rowell, & Frey, 2021).

But if __active__ methods are __indeed__ superior, then __why__ haven't we __all__ adopted them? A __highly__ cited 2008 paper, published on the prestigious journal _Science_, reveals that us students are __often__ unaware of our __own learning__ when it comes to reflecting on it (Karpicke & Roediger, 2008). If we __struggle__ to assess our __own learning__, how could we expect to find the __best__ study strategies on __our own__? You may assume that __teachers__ can surely guide us in this regard, but __research__ says otherwise. A 2016 study published on _Memory_ (Morehead, Rhodes, & Delozier, 2016) found out that instructors were only __slightly__ more likely than us students to recommend effective habits __over__ ineffective ones when presented with two scenarios. No __wonder__ the cross-disciplinary study mentioned earlier highlighted that us pupils spend only __half__ of our study time on __active__ study strategies (Walck-Shannon, Rowell, & Frey, 2021). __Now__ that we understand the effectiveness of __active__ study methods and reasons behind their __underutilization__, let's explore __solutions__ to tackle this.

(section: solutions)

How can __we__ students adopt __more__ active study methods? The __most__ obvious step is __familiarizing__ ourselves with __these__ study methods, which we have __done__ a moment ago. It is __also__ crucial for us to recognize that the __implementation__ of study methods __plays__ a significant role. A 2018 study, which is __widely__ shared online, examined __effective__ and __ineffective__ ways to implement five __popular__ study strategies. For example, when using active study strategies such as __flashcards__, we should __avoid__ discarding them __once__ we answer correctly. __Even__ ineffective study methods can be improved with __better__ execution. This is __particularly__ useful if you need __time__ for transition from your current study habits. For instance, while __rereading__ is a passive method often used by us, __spacing__ the readings yields __superior__ memory performance compared to __cramming__ the readings (Miyatsu, Nguyen, & McDaniel, 2018). Wait, cramming __again__? Yes, cramming __is__ an ineffective implementation of rereading. In the beginning, I __promised__ to show __how to__ avoid cramming, and we will discuss it __now__.

As we __established__ earlier, __cramming__ is a result of __procrastination__. A 2019 literature review by three professors in Middle Tennessee State University attributed procrastination to the __devaluation__ of future tasks, known as "__temporal discounting__". To address this issue, we students need to __accurately__ assess the value of our tasks and __focus__ on future awards to counteract temporal discounting. Additionally, we should be __mindful__ of our full workload to __avoid__ underestimating the demands of future tasks (Korstange, Craig, & Duncan, 2019). By reducing the severity of our __procrastination__, we'll start studying __earlier__, allowing us to employ __active__ study methods instead of __cramming__ everything __right__ before the exam.

__Lastly__, it's important to note that __even if__ you adopt the solutions mentioned above, you __may__ not see immediate changes. However, __don't__ give up! Persistence __and__ consistency will eventually __lead__ to rewarding outcomes!
