# Reflection on Studying Mis-strategies

In the article "Studying Mis-strategies", I found all the sources and worked on most of the content by myself. After writing each paragraph, I asked generative AI to paraphrase my text in an academic tone. I have not completely replaced my text with the output from the AI. Instead, I found improvements in the paraphrased text and adapted it to my writing. This is how I completed the article. Below, I will be sharing what I felt using generative AI from writing the article.

Let's talk about using generative AI to paraphrase my text. When I compared my text with the paraphrased text from the AI, I found the paraphrased text so much better. "Better" here means the text flows more naturally and feels like it is written by a native English user. In detail, the AI used much better vocabularies for some keywords in the academic context. It also reorganized the ideas expressed by my text in a more coherent way. Most importantly, it helps me with conciseness. The only regret I had with it is that the paraphrased text does not preserve all ideas in my text. Understandably, aiming for conciseness necessitates removing some ideas, but I felt like it removed a bit too much such that my ideas are incomplete. This is why I found improvements over my text from the paraphrased text instead and adapted them. An additional benefit is that I can learn to write more coherently and professionally by finding the improvements myself. To conclude, I believe that generative AI is a gift to non-native English academics, though one cannot expect it to do all the work.

From the above experience, I also found that generative AI helped me to realize my English ability has significant room for improvement. It made me wonder how generative AI can help me in ways other than writing. One way to think about it is that generative AI has seen the entire Internet in its training, so the AI "knows" what a piece of high-quality text looks like. By telling the AI to paraphrase the text for us, the AI uses that knowledge. Then we can use the paraphrased text and learn from it, grasping how good an English writing can be. This can be applied to many other fields unrelated to writing, so I will be using more generative AI to accelerate my learning. This is one major advantage of generative AI in general. However, generative AI also has its general downsides, such as exhibiting biased responses. This is where the human comes in and gate-keeps the output of the AI. For instance, I need to manually look for improvements instead of copying the entire paraphrased text to ensure the AI does not distort my ideas. This shows that AI cannot completely replace my need to write, and humans in general. So the weakness would be that I need to carefully inspect the output before using it as the AI is not actually "aware" of its output in any way similar to our brains.

In the future, I will surely be using more generative AI. Balancing the advantages and disadvantages, the best way to use AI in general is using it as an augmentation to the human brain. We already have such augmentation, like your mobile phone, which can help you remember important stuff and remind you, freeing your brain from such mundane work. Generative AI is simply a much more advanced augmentation to the human brain. And like all tools, you need to learn how to use it properly. So in the future, I will practice using generative AI by simply using it more, exploring what it can do for me, so that I can make full use of its power appropriately.
