- topic: introduction
- [artificial intelligence](../../../../general/artificial%20intelligence.md) (AI) ::@:: John McCarthy, one of the founders of AI — "It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable."
  - artificial intelligence (AI) / intuition ::@:: What is it? A calculator? An operating system? A text editor? ChatGPT or DeepSeek?
  - artificial intelligence (AI) / motivations ::@:: forefront of computer applications; make machines do things so far that can be done by humans; in the long-term, make machines that can act, sense, and think intelligently
  - artificial intelligence (AI) / algorithms, techniques ::@:: heuristic search algorithms, knowledge representation languages, machine learning algorithms and reasoners, etc.
  - artificial intelligence (AI) / impacts ::@:: engineering, science; everyday life; humanity in general
  - artificial intelligence (AI) / in computer science (CS) ::@:: science and engineering of making intelligent computer programs, the frontier of computer applications; new ways to solve problems with a computer
  - artificial intelligence (AI) / origins ::@:: Ada Lovelace (1815–1852), Alan Turing (1912–1954)
    - artificial intelligence (AI) / origins / Ada Lovelace (1815–1852) ::@:: Considered as the first computer programmer. Her Note G describes an algorithm for Babbage's analytical engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. She described the analytical engine as able to do what we tell it to perform, but cannot anticipate things that we do not tell it to perform.
    - artificial intelligence (AI) / origins / Alan Turing (1912–1954) ::@:: Computing machinery and intelligence. _Mind_, 59:433-460, 1950. — "I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?' This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms 'machine' and 'think.'"
      - Turing test ::@:: A test to empirically determine whether a computer has achieved intelligence. A human questioner questions two respondents, one human, the other a computer function, whose identities are unknown to the human questioner. Using a specified format and context, the questioner interrogates the two respondents within a specific subject area. After a preset length of time or number of questions, the questioner is then asked to decide which respondent is human and which is a computer.
  - artificial intelligence (AI) / history
    - artificial intelligence (AI) / history / 1956 ::@:: John McCarthy coined the term "__artificial intelligence__" as the topic of the Dartmouth Conference, the first conference devoted to the subject. The conference was proposed by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon: "2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence".
    - artificial intelligence (AI) / history / Marvel (1992) ::@:: a real-time expert system that monitors the massive stream of data from the Voyager spacecraft, handling routine tasks, and alerting the analysts to more serious problems at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
    - artificial intelligence (AI) / history / Pegasus (1994) ::@:: a speech understanding program that handles airline ticket reservations
    - artificial intelligence (AI) / history / Gulf War ::@:: An AI planning and scheduling system employed by US military. A DARPA report said the saving from this AI system had paid back the US Government all its investment on AI during the past 20 years.
    - artificial intelligence (AI) / history / older AIs & misc ::@:: Deep Blue (1997), IBM Watson (2011), AlphaFold (2020)
    - artificial intelligence (AI) / history / playing Go ::@:: AlphaGo (2016), AlphaGo Zero (2017)
    - artificial intelligence (AI) / history / GPT ::@:: GPT-3 (2020), ChatGPT (2022), GPT4 (2023), GPT4o (2024)
    - artificial intelligence (AI) / history / chatbots ::@:: ELIZA (1963, Weizenbaum; a computer psychotherapist) <br/> BlenderBot 3 (2022, Meta; letdown) <br/> AI Test Kitchen (2022, Google; announced only) <br/> ChatGPT (2022, OpenAI; breakthrough)
  - artificial intelligence (AI) / brittleness ::@:: Current AI systems are still brittle. Examples include hallucinations, object recognition, sensitivity to disturbance, etc.
- [hallucination](../../../../general/hallucination%20(artificial%20intelligence).md) ::@:: A response generated by AI that contains false or misleading information presented as fact, e.g. false negatives, false positives, incorrect predictions. It is associated with unjustified responses or beliefs rather than perceptual experiences.
  - hallucination / causes ::@:: These errors can be caused by a variety of factors, including data biases, incorrect model assumptions, insufficient training data, etc.
  - hallucination / examples ::@:: DALL-E 2 or Midjourney unable to create the image you want because the AI does not understand your desired context.
- [model collapse](../../../../general/model%20collapse.md) ::@:: It is a phenomenon where machine learning models gradually degrade due to errors coming from uncurated training on the outputs of another model, including prior versions of itself. Such outputs are known as synthetic data. <p> A study in 2024 shows this. For example, after successive generations, nonsense text are forgotten. Biases in the dataset get amplified, e.g. forgetting obscure dog breeds exist due to under-representation in the initial dataset.
