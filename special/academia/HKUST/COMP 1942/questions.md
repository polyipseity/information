> Q1. Suppose that we are given the following conditional FP-tree on item “b”. We are also given a support threshold = 2 and the support of “b” is 15. In the lecture notes, we perform Step 1 and Step 2 to generate frequent patterns. According to these 2 steps, how many frequent itemsets (including item “b”) can we generate?

> Q1. In XLMiner, when we use “Neural Network”, we could set a set X of parameters (e.g., “Number of Epochs = 1000”). <br/>
> In our project, we set parameters of this “Neural Network” with some values (e.g., “Number of Epochs = 1000”). We call this network with these parameter values as M1. <br/>
> We set the same parameters of this “Neural Network” except only one parameter where this time, we set parameter “Number of Epochs” differently (e.g., “Number of Epochs = 2000”). <br/>
> We call this network with these parameter values as M2. <br/>
> In our project, based on the project specification, could we say the following? <br/>
> M1 is one possible data mining model and M2 is another possible data mining model.
