# Design Report

COMP 1942 Project Phase 2

- Authors: Group 69, xxsuoaa, yslaiaf

## Preprocessing

First, we format both the training data and the test data as a table using the Excel function "Format as Table".

1. Select the entire training data table, including the headers.
2. Find and press "Format as Table", then select any colors.
3. Check "My table contains headers" if it is not checked initially, then click "OK".
4. Do the same for the entire test data table.

Next, one of the discrete variable, `native-country`, has more than 30 distinct values. In particular, the training table has 41 distinct values while the test table has 40 distinct values. This is too many categories for our version of XLMiner to process.

From here on, do not touch the test table.

Before we reduce the number of categories, we need to sort the training table by `native-country` in ascending order. This is so that the frequency of the distinct values are somewhat randomized. We also need to record the original distinct values:

1. Create a new sheet named `native-country`.
2. Set value in `A1` as `key`, set value in `B1` as `value`.
3. Set formula in `A2` as `=UNIQUE(training!$M$2:$M$10001)`.
4. Copy `A2:A42`, and then paste (hover over "paste special" and click "values") at the same range. Afterwards, the range should not have any formulas.
5. Format `A1:B42` as a table using "Format as Table".

We need to use the "Reduce Categories" function of XLMiner. However, this function is also limited to 30 distinct values, so instead we need to do 2 passes for the training table. For each pass, perform the following steps:

1. Press on "Reduce Categories".
2. Configure the settings as in Figure 1. In particular, the settings needs to be changed are:
    - Data Range: `A2:N1056` for the 1st pass, `A1057:N10001` for the 2nd pass
    - First row contains headers: `false`
    - Category Variable: Ignore the option values. Choose the 13th option in the dropdown.
    - Limit number of categories to: `15`
    - Others: Check that the number of distinct values in the "Category Variables" table is 21 for the 1st pass and 20 for the 2nd pass.
3. Press on "Apply", and then "OK".
4. A summary sheet will be generated. Copy and paste (paste options: values) the transformed `native-country` column back into the `training` sheet at `O(start row):O(end row)`. Do not copy the meaningless headers.
5. For the 2nd pass of the training table, we additionally need to increment each `native-country` value by 15. This makes the processed `native-country` values unique from that of the 1st pass. This can be done by:
    1. Set `P(start row)` to `=$O(start row)+15`.
    2. Extend `P(start row)` to `P(start row):P(end row)`.
    3. Copy `P(start row):P(end row)`.
    4. Paste (paste options: values) at `O(start row):O(end row)`.
    5. Clear `P(start row):P(end row)`.

After that, we need to fill in the `native-country` string-to-number mappings in the `native-country` sheet.training table, fill in the mappings. We can do so easily:

1. Set `B2` to `=VLOOKUP($A2,training!$M$2:$O$10001,3,TRUE)`.
2. Extend `B2` to `B2:B42`.
3. Copy `B2:B42`, and then paste (paste options: values) at the same range. Afterwards, the range should not have any formulas.

For reference, our mapping is:

| Vietnam                    | 24    |
| Yugoslavia                 | 30    |

Afterwards, in the `training` sheet, cut and paste `O2:O10001` to `M2:M10001`.

Now we can finally touch the test table. Map the `native-country` column of the test table. To do so:

1. Set `N2` to `=VLOOKUP($M2,'native-country'!$A$2:$B$42,2,TRUE)`.
2. Extend `N2` to `N2:N8001`.
3. Copy `N2:N8001`, and then paste (paste options: values) at `M2:M8001`.
4. Clear `N2:N8001`.

Finally, sort both tables by all columns, left columns first. This can be done by starting with the rightmost column and sort by ascending. Then, go to the column on the immediate left and sort by ascending. Repeat this until the leftmost column is reached and sorted by ascending.

The above is not strictly necessarily. It is only for standardizing the results. For reference, the resulting workbook is available as `preprocessed.xlsx`.

## Models

We will be testing 5 models. All models below use `preprocessed.xlsx` as the source workbook.

### Model 1: _k_-Nearest Neighbors

Note that we only use continuous variables here. This is because _k_-nearest neighbors uses distance for classification, and distance cannot be meaningfully defined for discrete variables.

Press on "Data Science > Classify > _k_-Nearest Neighbors". Then, configure the model as follows:

| Data                             |                  |
|----------------------------------|------------------|

| # Records in the training data   | 6000             |
| # Records in the validation data | 4000             |

| Variables             |                                                                |

| Scale Variables       | age, education-num, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week |
| Output Variable       | income                                                         |

### Model 2: Classification Tree

Before we can use the classification tree model, note that the model in XLMiner requires distinct variables to have 15 or fewer distinct values. Unfortunately, the `native-country` column has 30 distinct values. To fix this, we need to use the "Reduce Categories" function of XLMiner:

1. Press on "Reduce Categories".
2. Configure the settings as in Figure 1. In particular, the settings needs to be changed are:
    - Data Range: `A1:N10001`
    - First row contains headers: `true`
    - Category Variable: `native-country`
    - Limit number of categories to: `15`
3. Press on "Apply", and then "OK".
4. A summary sheet will be generated. Copy and paste (paste options: values) the transformed table back into the `training` sheet at `A2:N10001`. Do not copy the headers.

After doing so, we can finally use the classification tree model.

Note that we do not use the `education` column because `education-num` is the continuous version of `education`, so we only need to choose one of them.

Press on "Data Science > Classify > Classification Tree". Then, configure the model as follows:

| Data                             |                  |
|----------------------------------|------------------|

### Model 3: Naive Bayes

Note that we do not use the `education` column because `education-num` is the continuous version of `education`, so we only need to choose one of them.

Also note that we do not partition the training–validation data into training data and validation data. This is because naive bayes classifiers require each distinct value to appear at least once in the training data, and the entire training–validation data is not large enough to ensure all possible distinct values appear in the training data at least once.

Press on "Data Science > Classify > Naive Bayes". Then, configure the model as follows:

| Data       |               |

### Model 4: Neural Network

Note that we do not use the `education` column because `education-num` is the continuous version of `education`, so we only need to choose one of them.

Press on "Data Science > Classify > Neural Network > Manual Network". Then, configure the model as follows:

### Model 5: Neural Network

The difference between this model and [model 4](#Model%204%20Neural%20Network) is that this model has an additional hidden layer of 64 neurons. We want to see if the hidden layer can improve the accuracy of the model.

Note that we do not use the `education` column because `education-num` is the continuous version of `education`, so we only need to choose one of them.

Press on "Data Science > Classify > Neural Network > Manual Network". Then, configure the model as follows:
