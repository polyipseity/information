  - The group forming deadline is 17 Feb \(Fri\) 11am.
  - After this deadline, all remaining students will be formed in 1-person groups. Note that if you decide to form a 1-member group, you should also submit the grouping information to us by the deadline.
  - If you want to find some partners, you could have two ways of finding partners.
    - __Option 1:__ You could leave your information in this [Google link \(Links to an external site.\)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Sr06GjtFomaZ7RDWwdhTMnB6nC3lTn7K69LdITkhVA/edit?usp=sharing) and also could find potential partners in this Google link.This option allows students to chat with other students before the final group forming, which is good to students to understand better before a group forming.
    - __Option 2:__ You could send an email to our tutor, \[redacted\] \( \[redacted\] \), to help you to find a partner for you. The email subject is "COMP1942: Help for Group Forming". In the email content, you could say that you want our tutor to find a partner for you.But, we do not guarantee that our tutor could help you to find a partner finally. Besides, we do not guarantee that our tutor could find a "hard-working" partner. It is possible that the partner assigned to you may not work too much for your project. We encourage you to find your partner by yourself.
  - The group list containing your group ID could be found in this [link](7-Project-Grouping.md).You will need to use this group ID for your project submissions.
  - If you have any questions about group forming, please send an email to our tutor, \[redacted\] \( \[redacted\] \).
