## page 3

4.1.1 (a) Founder of civil engineering

- the term "civil engineer" in English ::: first appeared in 1771 by John Smeaton
- John Smeaton
  - John Smeaton first ::: describe himself as a "civil engineer"
  - John Smeaton job ::: design of bridges, canals, harbours, and lighthouses
  - John Smeaton name ::: father of civil engineer

## page 4

Founder of civil engineering (cont'd)

- John Smeaton
  - John Smeaton importance ::: rediscovery and modern development of modern cement: Portland cement
    - Portland cement influence ::: reemergence of concrete as modern building material
  - John Smeaton building example ::: the 3rd Eddystone Lighthouse
    - the 3rd Eddystone Lighthouse years ::: 1755–1759
    - the 3rd Eddystone Lighthouse material ::: "hydraulic lime": a form of mortar that sets under water
    - the 3rd Eddystone Lighthouse technique ::: involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building

4.1.1 (b) The Institution of Civil Engineers

- Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) ::: professional engineering association
  - ICE founding ::: 1818, London
  - ICE first president ::: 1820, Thomas Telford

  - Great Pyramid of Giza surface ::: smooth surface casing stone mostly missing due to seismic activity, so the core is exposed

## page 9

Ancient Egypt (cont'd)

- Great Pyramid of Giza
  - Great Pyramid of Giza construction theories ::: stones dragged from quarry, then up a ramp beside the pyramid
  - Great Pyramid of Giza feasibility ::: Construction lasted 20 years and required up to 100000 people, installing 800 tonnes of stone daily. Limestone blocks need to be shaped and fitted precisely.
  - Great Pyramid of Giza extra structures ::: the Sphinx, all other Giza pyramids
