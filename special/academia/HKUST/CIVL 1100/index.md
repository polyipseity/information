- [free body](../../../../general/free%20body.md)
  - [§ external and internal forces](../../../../general/free%20body.md#external%20and%20internal%20forces)
  - [§ example](../../../../general/free%20body.md#example)
  - free body in structural engineering ::@:: The free body is likely a structure. It can deform but should stay in static equilibrium, such as the [Leaning Tower of Pisa](../../../../general/Leaning%20Tower%20of%20Pisa.md).
- [solid mechanics § types of forces](../../../../general/solid%20mechanics.md#types%20of%20forces)
- [compression § effects](../../../../general/compression%20(physics).md#effects)
  - compression types ::@:: We are concerned with uniaxial compression only.
  - compression examples in structures ::@:: arch bridge, elevated water tank, igloo (snow house)
  - compression conventions ::@:: __negative__; arrows pointing inwards for forces applied on the object in compression
- [tension § effects](../../../../general/tension%20(physics).md#effects)
  - tension types ::@:: We are concerned with uniaxial tension only.
  - tension examples in structures ::@:: cable, hanging column, rope, swing, tie
  - tension conventions ::@:: __positive__; arrows pointing outwards for forces applied on the object in tension
- [reaction](../../../../general/reaction%20(physics).md) of compression and tension ::@:: Note that when another object exerts compression/tension on an object, the object applies an opposing pushing/pulling (reaction) force on the other object.
- [Hooke's law § linear springs](../../../../general/Hooke's%20law.md#linear%20springs)
- stress and strain
  - strength of an object ::@:: Under compression or tension, objects deform. But it can differ in severity. "Strong", "hard", or "rigid" materials deform less while "weak", "soft", or "flexible" materials deform more.
    - "strong" object examples ::@:: table leg
    - "weak" object examples ::@:: mattress
  - relative deformation ::@:: Amount of deformation also depends on the original length of the object.
    - relative deformation examples ::@:: Compare deforming a thin mattress and a thick mattress.
  - [stress](../../../../general/stress%20(mechanics).md)
    - [§ uniaxial normal](../../../../general/stress%20(mechanics).md#uniaxial%20normal)
  - [strain](../../../../general/strain%20(mechanics).md)
    - [§ engineering strain](../../../../general/strain%20(mechanics).md#engineering%20strain)
      - engineering strain symbol ::@:: $\varepsilon$
- [elastic modulus](../../../../general/elastic%20modulus.md)
  - [§ definition](../../../../general/elastic%20modulus.md#definition)
  - [§ types of elastic modulus](../../../../general/elastic%20modulus.md#types%20of%20elastic%20modulus)
- [Young's modulus](../../../../general/Young's%20modulus.md)
  - [§ definition](../../../../general/Young's%20modulus.md#definition)
- moment or [torque](../../../../general/torque.md)
  - pivot ::@:: A moment requires a pivot to be defined. The pivot can be anywhere and does not need to be physical.
  - torque intuition ::@:: Torque creates rotation just as force creates translation (linear movement).
  - [§ moment arm formula](../../../../general/torque.md#moment%20arm%20formula)
  - symbol of moment about point $P$ ::@:: $M_P$
  - torque conventions ::@:: __counterclockwise positive__, clockwise negative
  - [§ principles of moments](../../../../general/torque.md#principles%20of%20moments)
    - application of principles of moments ::@:: This means when the moment arm of a force is difficult to find for calculating the moment, instead decompose the force into 2 or more forces (usually horizontal and vertical). Summing the torques from those forces gives the moment.
- [bending](../../../../general/bending.md)
  - bending conditions ::@:: For a pinned support, an object subject to a moment rotates about the support. For a fixed support, an object subject to a moment bends.
  - [§ quasi-static bending of beams](../../../../general/bending.md#quasi-static%20bending%20of%20beams)
- [cantilever](../../../../general/cantilever.md) ::@:: a overhanging structure with only 1 support on 1 end; should be a fixed support to prevent rotation
- simply supported beam ::@:: a beam with 2 supports on its 2 ends; should be a pinned support and a roller support to get a statically determinate structure
- [torsion](../../../../general/torsion%20(mechanics).md) ::@:: twisting of an object
  - torsion deformation ::@:: The object is likely to return to its original shape when torsion forces are removed.
  - torsion examples ::@:: drill pipes, power transmission shafts, tall buildings
- [shear](../../../../general/shear%20force.md) ::@:: created by forces not acting on the same line; think of a rectangle being "parallelogramized" by 2 forces facing opposite directions
  - shear examples ::@:: shear damage of road surface due to braking of heavy vehicles or fast running rainwater
- [structural support](../../../../general/structural%20support.md) ::@:: fixed support, pinned support, roller support
  - [§ roller support](../../../../general/structural%20support.md#roller%20support)
  - [§ pinned support](../../../../general/structural%20support.md#pinned%20support)
  - [§ fixed support](../../../../general/structural%20support.md#fixed%20support)
- [static equilibrium](../../../../general/mechanical%20equilibrium.md)
  - [§ equilibrium equations](../../../../general/mechanical%20equilibrium.md#equilibrium%20equations)
  - [§ statically indeterminate system](../../../../general/structural%20support.md#statically%20indeterminate%20system)
- use "critical thinking" ::@:: more like whether you are good at mathematics and physics

## assessments

- final examination
  - report
    - Neither paper checking nor results release. But they are all MCs, so...
    - Yeah, memorize everything would work. Hope that you have a good memory...
