> Q31. One task frequently appearing in machine learning is to compute the "distances" between different data points. A "data point" in this question has 3 different features represented by 3 floating point values. Suppose an array `X` of shape (2211, 3) holds 2211 data points (which is our training data set), and another array `T` of shape (300, 3) holds 300 data points (which is our test data set). Using broadcasting magic, compute the NumPy array `dists` of shape (2211, 300), where dists[i, j] is the distance between `X[i]` and `T[j]` for each `i` and `j`.
>
> For the sake of terminology, the distance between x = (x1, x2, x3) and y = (y1, y2, y3) is defined as the square root of (x1 - y1)^2 + (x2 - y2)^2 + (x3 - y3)^2.

> Q4. (advanced) On average, 1 in 1000 drivers drunk drives. A breath analyzer with an error rate of 5% (5% false positive, 5% false negative) is used to test if a driver is drunk driving. Police stop a driver at random and administer the breath analyzer, which reports that the driver is indeed drunk driving.
>
> Answer the following two questions.
>
> 1. Since the breath analyzer has an error rate of 5%, a student claims the probability that the driver is drunk driving should be 95%. Explain why this intuition is wrong.

>
> - solution: {@{For 1, it neglects the base rate, i.e. 1 in 1000 drivers drunk drives (see base rate fallacy). <p> For 2, this is $$\frac {1 / 1000 \times 0.95} {(1 / 1000 \times 0.95) + (999 / 1000 \times 0.05)} \approx 1.87\% \,.$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-01-03,292,330-->
