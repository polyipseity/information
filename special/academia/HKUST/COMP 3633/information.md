## ethical hacking

Principles of ethical hacking include {@{complying with laws, seeking approval, and investigate system vulnerabilities for fixing them only}@}.

For example:

- after hacking ::@:: Cleanup all traces of hacking so that other malicious hackers cannot identify the vulnerabilities easily.
- anomalies found ::@:: Report all found security breaches and vulnerabilities to the system administrators.
- before hacking ::@:: Seek authorization and approval from the system administrators, and state the scope of your assessment and your plan clearly to them.
- confidentiality ::@:: Keep all learnt vulnerabilities confidential and do not utilize them detrimentally to the system owners.
