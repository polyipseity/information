In this course, you are expected to learn and self-learn analysis of various computer systems for security flaws, acquire team-working and leadership skills with your classmates, prepare for real-world cybersecurity challenges via capture the flag (CTF) competitions, and prepare to educate less experienced students in COMP 2633 on cybersecurity.

COMP 2633 train students in basic cybersecurity skills. After selection, students can join COMP 3633 to get further training and play CTF competitions. After further selection, students can join COMP 4633 to train COMP 2633 students.

## logistics

Lectures are 3 hours 50 minutes long officially, but can be longer in practice. In the first 3 to 4 weeks, you will learn cybersecurity topics from the coach.

## ethical hacking

Principles of ethical hacking include {{complying with laws, seeking approval, and investigate system vulnerabilities for fixing them only}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-30,19,250-->

For example:

- after hacking ::: Cleanup all traces of hacking so that other malicious hackers cannot identify the vulnerabilities easily. <!--SR:!2024-11-03,45,290!2024-11-13,56,310-->
- anomalies found ::: Report all found security breaches and vulnerabilities to the system administrators. <!--SR:!2024-11-05,49,310!2024-11-02,44,290-->
- before hacking ::: Seek authorization and approval from the system administrators, and state the scope of your assessment and your plan clearly to them. <!--SR:!2024-11-04,48,310!2024-11-14,57,310-->
- confidentiality ::: Keep all learnt vulnerabilities confidential and do not utilize them detrimentally to the system owners. <!--SR:!2024-11-26,63,310!2024-12-05,72,310-->
