Lab2 has 5 test cases:

Test 1: 1 6

Explain: Because only 6 in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is a perfect number,
the output is -1-2-3-4-5+6 = -9.

Test 2: 30 27

Explain: Because only 28 in {27, 28, 29, 30} is a perfect number,
the output is -27+28-29-30 = -58.

Test 3: 33550336 33550336

Explain: Because 33550336 is a perfect number, the output is 33550336.

Test 4: 128 132

Explain: Because all {128, 129, 130, 131, 132} are not perfect numbers,
the output is -128-129-130-131-132 = -650.

Test 5: 6 28

Explain: Because 6 and 28 are perfect numbers,
the output is 6-7-8 ... -26-27+28 = -323.
