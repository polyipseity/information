Lab3 has 6 test cases in 3 pairs:

Test 1: Encrypt "COMP" with key 11
Explanation: 
CO -> 66 + 11 = 77 -> CZ
MP -> 327 + 11 = 338 -> NA

Test 2: Encrypt "AAZZ" with key 0
Explanation:
AA -> 0 + 0 = 0 -> AA
ZZ -> 675 + 0 = 675 -> ZZ
This case tests the boundary values.  

Test 3: Encrypt "YEAH" with key 600
Explanation:
YE -> (628 + 600) % 676 = 552 -> VG
AH -> 7 + 600 = 607 -> XJ
This case tests whether the students master the modulo operation.

Test 4 - 6 are corresponding cases for decryption.
