They focused more on improvisation and standards \(popular songs\). <!--SR:!2025-10-24,143,422!2025-10-21,140,422-->
- [bebop](../../../../general/bebop.md) ::@:: It is a style of jazz developed in the early to mid-1940s in the United States. It can be considered as the start of modern jazz. <p> The name comes from the rhythm. <!--SR:!2025-10-28,147,422!2025-10-29,148,422-->
  - bebop / beginning ::@:: It began to develop in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Early recordings did not exist during 1942 to 1944 because of musicians' strike. <p> So some people think bebop suddenly appeared instead of being developed.

  - bebop / characteristics
    - bebop / characteristics / harmonic improvisation ::@:: Melody is created from harmony instead of the other way around. Before, improvisation was generalized and not specific to harmony. Now, number of possible melody is larger, adding variety, creating extensions and/or tensions. <!--SR:!2025-10-23,142,422!2025-10-23,142,422-->
    - bebop / characteristics / new rhythm ::@:: lots of variety, sophisticated rhythm approach, surprising the audience <!--SR:!2025-10-29,148,422!2025-10-21,140,422-->
