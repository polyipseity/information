# signal tools

We introduced {{3 signal tools: [Audacity](#Audacity), [SonicVisualiser](#SonicVisualiser), and [sms-tools](#sms-tools)}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-27,59,310-->

## Audacity

Audacity is {{an audio editor}}. It can be downloaded from {{<https://audacityteam.org/>}} <!--SR:!2024-11-03,66,310!2024-10-31,63,310-->

### analysis (Audacity)

Audacity can show {{the spectrogram of a signal}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-09,68,329-->

### generating periodic signals

Audacity can generate {{real sine signals of any frequency and amplitude}}. The signals can also be {{non-sinusoidal, such as _sawtooth_-shaped and _triangle_-shaped}}, which have {{more complex frequency components}}. It can even generate signals that {{increases in frequency over time (increasing pitch)}}, called {{_chirp_}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-15,17,318!2024-10-22,43,318!2024-09-15,17,318!2024-09-13,15,318!2024-09-14,16,318-->

## SonicVisualiser

SonicVisualiser is {{an audio visualization, analysis, and annotation tool}}. It can be downloaded from {{<https://sonicvisualiser.org/>}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-21,53,310!2024-10-27,59,310-->

### applying DFT on complicated sounds

SonicVisualiser can {{apply DFT on complicated sounds and produce a magnitude spectrum of its frequencies}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-13,15,318-->

## sms-tools

`sms-tools` is {{an audio analysis and synthesis tool, written in Python (and some C)}}. The installation and usage instructions are on {{<https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools>}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-26,58,310!2024-11-08,71,310-->

### analysis (sms-tools)

`sms-tools` can show {{the spectrum magnitude and phase of a signal}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-12,71,329-->

## Freesound

Freesound is {{a repository of free and open (Creative Commons) sounds}}. Its website is {{<https://freesound.org/>}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-12,71,329!2024-11-13,72,329-->
