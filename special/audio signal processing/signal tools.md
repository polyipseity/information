# signal tools

We introduced {@{3 signal tools: [Audacity](#Audacity), [SonicVisualiser](#SonicVisualiser), and [sms-tools](#sms-tools)}@}.

## Audacity

Audacity is {@{an audio editor}@}. It can be downloaded from {@{<https://audacityteam.org/>}@}

### analysis (Audacity)

Audacity can show {@{the spectrogram of a signal}@}.

### generating periodic signals

Audacity can generate {@{real sine signals of any frequency and amplitude}@}. The signals can also be {@{non-sinusoidal, such as _sawtooth_-shaped and _triangle_-shaped}@}, which have {@{more complex frequency components}@}. It can even generate signals that {@{increases in frequency over time (increasing pitch)}@}, called {@{_chirp_}@}.

## SonicVisualiser

SonicVisualiser is {@{an audio visualization, analysis, and annotation tool}@}. It can be downloaded from {@{<https://sonicvisualiser.org/>}@}.

### applying DFT on complicated sounds

SonicVisualiser can {@{apply DFT on complicated sounds and produce a magnitude spectrum of its frequencies}@}.

### pitch detection \(SonicVisualiser\)

SonicVisualiser supports {@{many pitch detection algorithms}@}.

## sms-tools

`sms-tools` is {@{an audio analysis and synthesis tool, written in Python (and some C)}@}. The installation and usage instructions are on {@{<https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools>}@}.

### analysis (sms-tools)

`sms-tools` can show {@{the spectrum magnitude and phase of a signal}@}. It also supports using {@{models to analyze a sound}@}, e.g. {@{STFT model, sinusoidal model, etc.}@}

### synthesis (sms-tools)

`sms-tools` support {@{many synthesis models}@}, e.g. {@{STFT model, sinusoidal model, etc.}@}

## Freesound

Freesound is {@{a repository of free and open (Creative Commons) sounds}@}. Its website is {@{<https://freesound.org/>}@}.
