## sine wave

- see: [general/sine wave](../../general/sine%20wave.md)

{{A continuous [sine wave](../../general/sine%20wave.md)}} (cosine in the below equation) in its most general form has the equation: <!--SR:!2024-10-03,52,310-->

> __continuous (co)sine wave__
>
> {{$$f(x, t) = A \cos(kx \pm \omega t + \phi) + D$$}}
>
> - where
>   - $f(x, t)$ is {{displacement at position $x$ and time $t$}}.
>   - $A$ is {{amplitude, i.e. maximum displacement}}.
>   - $k$ is {{angular wavenumber or angular spatial frequency}}.
>   - $\omega$ is {{angular frequency, which equals 2 pi times normal (linear) frequency $\omega = 2\pi f$}}.
>   - $\phi$ is {{initial phase offset}}.
>   - $D$ is {{equilibrium offset}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-21,44,290!2024-10-03,52,310!2024-10-10,59,310!2024-10-15,64,310!2024-10-04,53,310!2024-10-05,54,310!2024-10-16,65,310-->

In signal processing, apart from analog signals (continuous signals), we also deal with {{digital signals (discrete signals)}}. In that case, usually {{the time is discretized}}. So the equation becomes: <!--SR:!2024-10-08,57,310!2024-10-15,64,310-->

For the two equations above, we will ignore {{the $kx$ term and the $\pm$ operator as we care about time more}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-20,67,310-->

To generate a discrete cosine wave using Numpy, make use of {{the above equations, `np.arange`, and `np.cos`}}: <!--SR:!2024-10-26,73,310-->

```Python
import numpy as np
(A, w, phi, D), (start, end, T) = (0.8, 2, 0, 0), (-1, 1, 0.001)
wave = A * np.cos(w * T * np.arange(start, end, T) + phi) + D
```

## complex number

- see: [general/complex number](../../general/complex%20number.md)

Note that the [complex number](../../general/complex%20number.md) described here is {{colloquial, and not necessarily mathematically rigorous}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-09,58,310-->

The numbers (with decimals) we are familiar are {{the _real numbers_}}. Now, we extend it by {{defining the _imaginary unit_ $j = \sqrt{-1}$ ($j$ is more commonly used than $i$ in electrical engineering)}}. Then the _complex numbers_ are {{all numbers in the form of $a + bj$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers}}. Visually, we can think of each complex number as {{a point on a 2D plane, with the x-coordinate being the _real part_ ($x = \operatorname{Re}(a + bj) = a$) and the y-coordinate being the _imaginary part_ ($y = \operatorname{Im}(a + bj) = b$)}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-18,67,310!2024-10-16,65,310!2024-10-06,55,310!2024-10-05,54,310-->

With the point on a 2D plane visualization in mind, we call the $a + bj$ form {{the _rectangular form_, because the coordinates specify a rectangle from the origin to the 2D point}}. An alternative form is {{the _polar form_ $(A, \phi)$, where $A$ is the distance from the origin to the 2D point and $\phi$ is the angle formed with the right direction, increasing counterclockwise}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-10,59,310!2024-10-21,68,310-->

We can {{convert}} in between rectangular form and polar form. From rectangular form to polar form: {{$$(A, \phi) = \left( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, \operatorname{atan2}\left(b, a\right) \right)$$}}, where [`atan2`](../../general/atan2.md) produces the angle formed with the right direction, constrained between {{$(-\pi, \pi]$}}, and is defined as: {{$$\operatorname{atan2}(y, x) = \begin{cases} \arctan\left(\frac y x \right) & \text{if }x > 0 \\ \arctan\left(\frac y x \right) + \pi & \text{if }x < 0\text{ and }y \ge 0 \\ \arctan\left(\frac y x \right) - \pi & \text{if }x < 0\text{ and }y < 0 \\ \text{(3 special values omitted; use intuition)} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$}}. From polar form to rectangular form: {{$$a + bj = A \cos \phi + j A \sin \phi$$}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-09,58,310!2024-10-07,56,310!2024-10-07,56,310!2024-09-28,30,210!2024-10-03,52,310-->

## Euler's formula

- see: [general/Euler's formula](../../general/Euler's%20formula.md)

[Euler's formula](../../general/Euler's%20formula.md) is: {{$$e^{j\varphi} = \cos \varphi + j \sin \varphi$$, where $\varphi$ is a [complex number](#complex%20number)}}. The above implies alternative formulas for {{$\sin$ and $\cos$}}: {{$$\begin{aligned} \cos \varphi & = \frac {e^{j\varphi} + e^{-j\varphi} } 2 \\ \sin \varphi & = \frac {e^{j\varphi} - e^{-j\varphi} } {2j} \end{aligned}$$}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-18,67,310!2024-10-11,60,310!2024-09-26,49,290-->

Using Euler's formula, we can express waves {{using exponentiation instead}}. For example, the discrete sine wave {{$$f(x) [n] = A \cos(kx \pm \omega T n + \phi) + D$$}} can also be expressed as {{$$f(x) [n] = \operatorname{Re}\left(A e^{j(kx \pm \omega Tn + \phi)}\right) + D = \operatorname{Re}\left(A e^{j \phi} e^{j(kx \pm \omega Tn)}\right) + D = \operatorname{Re}\left(X e^{j(kx \pm \omega Tn)} \right) + D \qquad X := A e^{j \phi}$$}}. The latter expression has the advantage that {{exponentiation is much easier to manipulate than trigonometric functions}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-26,87,341!2024-10-12,50,321!2024-10-23,54,321!2024-11-22,83,341-->

## dot product

- see: [general/dot product ยง complex vectors](../../general/dot%20product.md#complex%20vectors)

The __dot product__ or __scalar product__ of two sequences $x$ and $y$ is defined as: {{$$\langle x, y \rangle = \sum_{n = 0}^{N - 1} x[n] y^*[n]$$ (the variant that is linear in the 1st argument)}}. Geometrically, two sequences are {{orthogonal iff their dot product is $0$, i.e. $\langle x, y \rangle = 0$}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-28,59,321!2024-11-22,83,341-->

## even and odd sequences

- see: [general/even and odd functions](../../general/even%20and%20odd%20functions.md)

A sequence is {{even or symmetric}} iff {{$f[-n] = f[n]$}}. A sequence is {{odd or antisymmetric}} iff {{$f[-n] = -f[n]$}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-04,67,341!2024-11-21,82,341!2024-11-25,86,341!2024-11-13,76,341-->

## convolution

- see: [general/convolution](../../general/convolution.md)

The convolution of 2 sequences $x$ and $y$ is denoted {{$x[n] * y[n]$ or $x * y$}}. It is defined as {{$$(x * y) [n] = \sum_{m = 0}^{N - 1} x[m] y[n - m]$$}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-04,65,321!2024-10-29,60,321-->

It can be visualized as follows. Take 2 sequences $x$ and $y$. Then, {{reflect the 2nd argument $y$ across $0$, i.e. $$y'[n] = y[-n]$$}}. Then the convolution $x * y$ {{at argument $n = 0$ is the dot product of $x$ and $y'$ ($y$ reflected), i.e. $$(x * y) [0] = \sum_{m = 0}^{N - 1} x[m] y'[m] = \sum_{m = 0}^{N - 1} x[m] y[-m]$$}}. When the argument $n$ is not $0$, then {{the argument specifies how much $y'$ is shifted, with positive values shifting to the right, i.e. $$y'_n[m] = y'[m - n] = y[n - m]$$}}. Then the convolution $x * y$ {{at nonzero argument is the dot product of $x$ and $y'_n$ ($y$ reflected and shifted by $n$), i.e. $$(x * y) [n] = \sum_{m = 0}^{N - 1} x[m] y'_n[m] = \sum_{m = 0}^{N - 1} x[m] y'[m - n] = \sum_{m = 0}^{N - 1} x[m] y[n - m]$$}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-17,79,341!2024-11-27,88,341!2024-11-06,69,341!2024-11-08,71,341-->
