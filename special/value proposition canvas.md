<!--/pytextgen-->

Value proposition design starts from {@{tools, value proposition canvas; design and test; and evolve}@}. It is important to note that value proposition design is {@{a nonlinear and messy process that gets more linear and clean over time}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-13,394,230!2029-08-04,1445,327-->

Value proposition design works for {@{both new ventures and established organizations}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-16,1479,310-->

## canvas

The value proposition canvas has two parts: {@{the customer profile showing your customer understanding and the value map showing your product and its values. Achieve fit by having your product create value that satisfies customers}@}. <!--SR:!2027-02-12,679,289-->

The value map itself has three parts: {@{products and services, pain relievers, and gain creators}@}. It corresponds to the three parts of the customer profile: {@{customer jobs, pains, and gains}@}. Fit is achieved when {@{pain relievers relieve pains and gain creators create gains that are important to the customer}@}. <!--SR:!2027-07-06,896,347!2029-02-14,1378,350!2026-12-05,722,329-->

### customer profile

Customer jobs can be split into three categories: {@{functional jobs; social jobs, seek to be perceived in a certain way by others; and personal or emotional jobs, seek to feel a certain way}@}. There are also supporting jobs arising from three different roles: {@{buyer of value, buying value; co-creator of value, participating in creating value; and transferrer of value, end of lifecycle}@}. Note that jobs {@{have different priorities}@}.  The jobs can be improved by {@{asking why repeatedly until you find the root job}@}. <!--SR:!2026-11-19,620,289!2026-10-02,592,289!2030-03-15,1608,329!2026-01-16,442,325-->

Since customer jobs has {@{functional and non-functional aspects}@}, the resulting products can be categorized by {@{functional complexity and emotional complexity}@}. It is important that non-functional aspects are {@{not ignored}@}. For example, a hunching old person needs a stick, but {@{the person also wants to not feel bad while using the stick}@}. Sometimes, non-functional aspects are {@{more important than functional ones}@}, such as {@{an extremely expensive sports car, which is mainly for showing status instead of driving on it}@}. So a {@{deep understanding}@} of customer jobs is required. <!--SR:!2031-06-20,2072,385!2031-02-13,1966,385!2026-06-30,547,325!2028-03-19,1104,365!2030-11-27,1907,385!2026-12-28,669,325!2030-04-21,1733,385-->

The concept of customer jobs is based on {@{the jobs to be done theory}@}, which states that {@{customers "hire" a product to do a "job" instead of simply buying a product}@}. <!--SR:!2028-06-16,1177,365!2027-08-22,914,345-->

Customer pains include {@{undesirable things, obstacles, and risks}@}. Make pains {@{concrete}@}. Note that pains {@{can have different severity}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-15,1480,310!2027-12-17,1025,349!2026-07-26,620,329-->

Customer gains can be separated into four levels: {@{required, required by customers; expected, expected by customers; desired gains, wanted by customers; and unexpected gains, wanted by customers but customers do not know}@}. Make gains {@{concrete}@}. Like customer pains, note that gains {@{can have different severity}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-12,381,249!2027-02-02,794,349!2028-07-01,1206,350-->

Since customer jobs, customer pains, and customer gains all can have {@{different priorities or severity, so we can rank them}@}. Ranking them can be based on {@{what you think given that it eventually truly reflects the customers' perspectives}@}.  Pains and gains can exist {@{on a continuum, are not always absolute or binary}@}. For example, {@{waiting time for a food order}@} can be {@{a gain if it is faster than expected and a pain if it is slower than expected}@}. Pains and gains are also not {@{opposite}@}, like {@{coffee temperature being too low or too high are both pains}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-17,592,310!2027-02-15,804,349!2030-10-03,1861,385!2026-04-19,196,345!2028-09-27,1238,365!2026-10-04,678,344!2026-01-02,69,348-->

There are several [common mistakes](#customer%20profile%20common%20mistakes) to be aware of. <!--SR:!2024-05-16,18,269-->

### value map

Products and services is {@{simply a list of what you offer}@}, and can also include {@{supporting products and services}@}. It can be {@{physical, intangible, digital, or financial}@}. It is important to recognize products and services do not {@{create value by themselves (no intrinsic values), but in relationship with the customer segment}@}. Note that products and services {@{can have different relevance to your customers}@}. <!--SR:!2026-11-03,648,310!2028-01-14,1022,329!2028-05-01,1039,289!2026-11-04,600,270!2026-06-29,611,329-->

Pain relievers describe {@{how the products or services alleviate customer pains}@}. There is no need to {@{alleviate every identified pain}@}, and instead {@{it is better to alleviate some extreme pains extremely well}@}. Like products and services, pain relievers {@{can have different relevance to your customers}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-09,939,349!2026-08-09,632,329!2028-07-25,1148,310!2026-04-06,502,310-->

Gain creators describe {@{how the products or services create customer gains}@}. There is also no need to {@{create every identified gain}@}, and instead {@{it is better to create some relevant gains extremely well}@}. Like products and services, gain creators {@{can have different relevance to your customers}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-03,1562,369!2027-07-17,907,349!2026-08-29,658,329!2026-05-21,520,309-->

### fit

Fit is when {@{your pain relievers relieve customer pains, gain creators create customer gains, and products and services satisfy customer jobs}@}. To check fit, {@{put two ticks on the pair if there is a matching pair in the customer profile and the value map, and cross out those without any matches}@}. A strong fit indicates {@{customer satisfaction, market differentiation, and value creation}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-02,508,310!2031-03-06,1930,330!2027-03-28,763,345-->

However, checking the fit on paper like above is {@{not enough}@}. Fit happens in three stages: {@{problem–solution fit, product–market fit, and business model fit}@}. To achieve these three fits requires {@{a nonlinear and iterative process}@}. Value proposition design allows quick {@{design, test, and repeat}@}. <!--SR:!2028-02-14,1083,349!2026-06-10,472,249!2031-03-14,1955,349!2027-06-24,897,330-->

## design

Design is {@{designing business models from your value proposition}@}. <!--SR:!2027-12-05,965,309-->

### prototyping

Prototyping is {@{making quick study models to explore alternatives and reshape your value propositions}@}. <!--SR:!2028-04-01,1033,289-->

### interview your customers

Interviewing your customers has several steps:

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("123f", "49ba",),
  R"""
create a customer profile
outline the interview
interview
capture new customer profile

find customer patterns
""".strip().splitlines(),

### test card

When designing tests, you can use {@{test cards}@}. Test cards have {@{basic info like name, due date, and person responsible; hypothesis; test; metric; and criteria}@}. <!--SR:!2028-01-06,1067,350!2025-12-03,412,270-->

One test card is insufficient. Design {@{a series of experiments, rank them by cruicalness, and run experiments}@}. Note that {@{first experiments may invalidate crucial hypotheses that invalidates the rest of the tests}@}. <!--SR:!2027-09-07,900,309!2026-01-15,484,329-->

## evolve

Evolve is {@{improving and reinvent yourself constantly}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-25,632,329-->
