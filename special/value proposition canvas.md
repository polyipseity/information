### target audience

Value proposition design is for:

  R"""
idea quality: involved in failed bold shiny projects vs. avoid wasting time in bad ideas

Value proposition design starts from {@{tools, value proposition canvas; design and test; and evolve}@}. It is important to note that value proposition design is {@{a nonlinear and messy process that gets more linear and clean over time}@}.

Value proposition design works for {@{both new ventures and established organizations}@}.

## canvas

The value proposition canvas has two parts: {@{the customer profile showing your customer understanding and the value map showing your product and its values. Achieve fit by having your product create value that satisfies customers}@}.

The value map itself has three parts: {@{products and services, pain relievers, and gain creators}@}. It corresponds to the three parts of the customer profile: {@{customer jobs, pains, and gains}@}. Fit is achieved when {@{pain relievers relieve pains and gain creators create gains that are important to the customer}@}.

### customer profile

Customer jobs can be split into three categories: {@{functional jobs; social jobs, seek to be perceived in a certain way by others; and personal or emotional jobs, seek to feel a certain way}@}. There are also supporting jobs arising from three different roles: {@{buyer of value, buying value; co-creator of value, participating in creating value; and transferrer of value, end of lifecycle}@}. Note that jobs {@{have different priorities}@}. The jobs can be improved by {@{asking why repeatedly until you find the root job}@}.

Since customer jobs has {@{functional and non-functional aspects}@}, the resulting products can be categorized by {@{functional complexity and emotional complexity}@}. It is important that non-functional aspects are {@{not ignored}@}. For example, a hunching old person needs a stick, but {@{the person also wants to not feel bad while using the stick}@}. Sometimes, non-functional aspects are {@{more important than functional ones}@}, such as {@{an extremely expensive sports car, which is mainly for showing status instead of driving on it}@}. So a {@{deep understanding}@} of customer jobs is required.

The concept of customer jobs is based on {@{the jobs to be done theory}@}, which states that {@{customers "hire" a product to do a "job" instead of simply buying a product}@}.

Customer pains include {@{undesirable things, obstacles, and risks}@}. Make pains {@{concrete}@}. Note that pains {@{can have different severity}@}.

Customer gains can be separated into four levels: {@{required, required by customers; expected, expected by customers}@}; {@{desired gains, wanted by customers; and unexpected gains, wanted by customers but customers do not know}@}. Make gains {@{concrete}@}. Like customer pains, note that gains {@{can have different severity}@}.

Since customer jobs, customer pains, and customer gains all can have {@{different priorities or severity, so we can rank them}@}. Ranking them can be based on {@{what you think given that it eventually truly reflects the customers' perspectives}@}. Pains and gains can exist {@{on a continuum, are not always absolute or binary}@}. For example, {@{waiting time for a food order}@} can be {@{a gain if it is faster than expected and a pain if it is slower than expected}@}. Pains and gains are also not {@{opposite}@}, like {@{coffee temperature being too low or too high are both pains}@}.

There are several [common mistakes](#customer%20profile%20common%20mistakes) to be aware of.

#### customer profile common mistakes

# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(

hyperfocus: focusing on functional jobs only
insufficiency: not enough jobs, pains, and gains
mix: mixing customer segments

vagueness: vague jobs, pains, and gains

### value map

Products and services is {@{simply a list of what you offer}@}, and can also include {@{supporting products and services}@}. It can be {@{physical, intangible, digital, or financial}@}. It is important to recognize products and services do not {@{create value by themselves (no intrinsic values), but in relationship with the customer segment}@}. Note that products and services {@{can have different relevance to your customers}@}.

Pain relievers describe {@{how the products or services alleviate customer pains}@}. There is no need to {@{alleviate every identified pain}@}, and instead {@{it is better to alleviate some extreme pains extremely well}@}. Like products and services, pain relievers {@{can have different relevance to your customers}@}.

Gain creators describe {@{how the products or services create customer gains}@}. There is also no need to {@{create every identified gain}@}, and instead {@{it is better to create some relevant gains extremely well}@}. Like products and services, gain creators {@{can have different relevance to your customers}@}.

There are several [common mistakes](#value%20map%20common%20mistakes) to be aware of.

# pytextgen generate data

### fit

Fit is when {@{your pain relievers relieve customer pains, gain creators create customer gains, and products and services satisfy customer jobs}@}. To {@{check fit}@}, {@{put two ticks on the pair}@} if there is {@{a matching pair in the customer profile and the value map}@}, and {@{cross out those without any matches}@}. A strong fit indicates {@{customer satisfaction, market differentiation, and value creation}@}.

However, checking the fit on paper like above is {@{not enough}@}. Fit happens in three stages: {@{problem–solution fit, product–market fit, and business model fit}@}. To achieve these three fits requires {@{a nonlinear and iterative process}@}. Value proposition design allows quick {@{design, test, and repeat}@}.

## design

Design is {@{designing business models from your value proposition}@}.

### prototyping

Prototyping is {@{making quick study models to explore alternatives and reshape your value propositions}@}.

### interview your customers

Interviewing your customers has several steps:

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("123f", "49ba",),
  R"""
create a customer profile
outline the interview
interview
capture new customer profile
review interview, and repeat from "outline the interview" several times, like 10 times
find customer patterns
""".strip().splitlines(),
)
```

## test

Test is {@{reducing risk and uncertainty of new ideas and then improving your value propositions}@}.

### test steps

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("9ba1", "c301",),
  R"""
hypothesis: extract hypotheses
hypothesis: prioritize hypotheses
test: design tests
test: prioritize tests
test: run tests
conclusion: capture findings
conclusion: make progress
""".strip().splitlines(),
)
```

- conclusion: capture findings→::@::←conclusion: make progress
- conclusion: make progress→::@::←_(end)_

<!--/pytextgen-->

### test card

When {@{designing tests}@}, you can use {@{test cards}@}. They have {@{basic info}@} like {@{name, due date, and person responsible}@}; {@{hypothesis; test; metric; and criteria}@}.

{@{One test card}@} is {@{insufficient}@}. Design {@{a series of experiments}@}, rank {@{them by cruicalness}@}, and run {@{experiments}@}. Note that {@{first experiments may invalidate crucial hypotheses}@} that {@{invalidates the rest of the tests}@}.

## evolve

{@{Evolve}@} is {@{improving and reinvent yourself constantly}@}.
