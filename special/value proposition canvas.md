## value proposition design

Value proposition design is for:

Value proposition design starts from {{tools, value proposition canvas; design and test; and evolve}}. It is important to note that value proposition design is {{a nonlinear and messy process that gets more linear and clean over time}}.

Value proposition design works for {{both new ventures and established organizations}}.

## canvas

The value proposition canvas has two parts: {{the customer profile showing your customer understanding and the value map showing your product and its values. Achieve fit by having your product create value that satisfies customers}}.

The value map itself has three parts: {{products and services, pain relievers, and gain creators}}. It corresponds to the three parts of the customer profile: {{customer jobs, pains, and gains}}. Fit is achieved when {{pain relievers relieve pains and gain creators create gains that are important to the customer}}.

### customer profile

Customer jobs can be split into three categories: {{functional jobs, social jobs, and personal or emotional jobs}}. There are also supporting jobs arising from three different roles: {{buyer of value, buying value; co-creator of value, participating in creating value; and transferrer of value, end of lifecycle}}. Note that jobs {{have different priorities}}.

Customer pains include {{undesirable things, obstacles, and risks}}. Make pains {{concrete}}. Note that pains {{can have different severity}}.

Customer gains can be separated into four levels: {{required, required by customers; expected, expected by customers; desired gains, wanted by customers; and unexpected gains, wanted by customers but customers do not know}}. Make gains {{concrete}}. Like customer pains, note that gains {{can have different severity}}.

Since customer jobs, customer pains, and customer gains all can have {{different priorities or severity, so we can rank them}}. Ranking them can be based on {{what you think given that it eventually truly reflects the customers' perspectives}}.

There are several [common mistakes](#customer%20profile%20common%20mistakes) to be aware of. Jobs to be done can be improved by {{asking why repeatedly until you find the root job}}.

### value map

Products and services is {{simply a list of what you offer}}, and can also include {{supporting products and services}}. It can be {{physical, intangible, digital, and financial}}. It is important to recognize products and services do not {{create value by themselves, but in relationship with the customer segment}}. Note that products and services {{can have different relevance to your customers}}.

Pain relievers describe {{how the products or services alleviate customer pains}}. There is no need to {{alleviate every identified pain}}, and instead {{it is better to alleviate some extreme pains extremely well}}. Like products and services, pain relievers {{can have different relevance to your customers}}.

Gain creators describe {{how the products or services create customer gains}}. There is also no need to {{create every identified gain}}, and instead {{it is better to create some relevant gains extremely well}}. Like products and services, gain creators {{can have different relevance to your customers}}.

There are several [common mistakes](#value%20map%20common%20mistakes) to be aware of.

#### value map common mistakes

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("ec13", "8ba2",),

### fit

Fit is when {{your pain relievers relieve customer pains, gain creators create customer gains, and products and services satisfy customer jobs}}. To check fit, {{put two ticks on the pair if there is a matching pair in the customer profile and the value map, and cross out those without any matches}}.

However, checking the fit on paper like above is {{not enough}}. Fit happens in three stages: {{problem–solution fit, product–market fit, and business model fit}}. To achieve these three fits requires {{a nonlinear and iterative process}}. Value proposition design allows quick {{design, test, and repeat}}.

## design

Design is {{designing business models from your value proposition}}.

### prototyping

Prototyping is {{making quick study models to explore alternatives and reshape your value propositions}}.

### interview your customers

Interviewing your customers has several steps:

%%

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("123f", "49ba",),
  R"""
create a customer profile
outline the interview
interview
capture new customer profile
review interview, and repeat from "outline the interview" several times, like 10 times
find customer patterns
""".strip().splitlines(),
)
```

<!--/pytextgen-->

## test

Test is {{reducing risk and uncertainty of new ideas and then improving your value propositions}}.

### test steps

%%

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("9ba1", "c301",),
  R"""
hypothesis: extract hypotheses
hypothesis: prioritize hypotheses
test: design tests
test: prioritize tests
test: run tests
conclusion: capture findings
conclusion: make progress
""".strip().splitlines(),
)
```

- conclusion: capture findings→:::←conclusion: make progress
- conclusion: make progress→:::←_(end)_

<!--/pytextgen-->

### test card

When designing tests, you can use {{test cards}}. Test cards have {{basic info like name, due date, and person responsible; hypothesis; test; metric; and criteria}}.

One test card is insufficient. Design {{a series of experiments, rank them by cruicalness, and run experiments}}. Note that {{first experiments may invalidate crucial hypotheses that invalidates the rest of the tests}}.

## evolve

Evolve is {{improving and reinvent yourself constantly}}.
