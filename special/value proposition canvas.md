<!--/pytextgen-->

Value proposition design starts from {{tools, value proposition canvas; design and test; and evolve}}. It is important to note that value proposition design is {{a nonlinear and messy process that gets more linear and clean over time}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-12,172,230!2025-08-20,340,307-->

Value proposition design works for {{both new ventures and established organizations}}. <!--SR:!2025-09-28,367,290-->

## canvas

The value proposition canvas has two parts: {{the customer profile showing your customer understanding and the value map showing your product and its values. Achieve fit by having your product create value that satisfies customers}}. <!--SR:!2025-04-04,235,289-->

The value map itself has three parts: {{products and services, pain relievers, and gain creators}}. It corresponds to the three parts of the customer profile: {{customer jobs, pains, and gains}}. Fit is achieved when {{pain relievers relieve pains and gain creators create gains that are important to the customer}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-18,198,327!2025-05-02,304,330!2024-12-12,169,309-->

### customer profile

Customer jobs can be split into three categories: {{functional jobs; social jobs, seek to be perceived in a certain way by others; and personal or emotional jobs, seek to feel a certain way}}. There are also supporting jobs arising from three different roles: {{buyer of value, buying value; co-creator of value, participating in creating value; and transferrer of value, end of lifecycle}}. Note that jobs {{have different priorities}}.  The jobs can be improved by {{asking why repeatedly until you find the root job}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-09,216,289!2025-02-17,205,289!2025-10-19,376,309!2026-01-16,442,325-->

Since customer jobs has {{functional and non-functional aspects}}, the resulting products can be categorized by {{functional complexity and emotional complexity}}. It is important that non-functional aspects are {{not ignored}}. For example, a hunching old person needs a stick, but {{the person also wants to not feel bad while using the stick}}. Sometimes, non-functional aspects are {{more important than functional ones}}, such as {{an extremely expensive sports car, which is mainly for showing status instead of driving on it}}. So a {{deep understanding}} of customer jobs is required. <!--SR:!2025-10-17,414,365!2025-09-26,393,365!2024-12-30,167,325!2025-03-11,233,345!2025-09-07,381,365!2025-02-27,206,325!2025-07-23,345,365-->

The concept of customer jobs is based on {{the jobs to be done theory}}, which states that {{customers "hire" a product to do a "job" instead of simply buying a product}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-27,248,345!2025-02-19,204,325-->

Customer pains include {{undesirable things, obstacles, and risks}}. Make pains {{concrete}}. Note that pains {{can have different severity}}. <!--SR:!2025-09-26,367,290!2025-02-25,226,329!2024-11-13,144,309-->

Customer gains can be separated into four levels: {{required, required by customers; expected, expected by customers; desired gains, wanted by customers; and unexpected gains, wanted by customers but customers do not know}}. Make gains {{concrete}}. Like customer pains, note that gains {{can have different severity}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-27,153,249!2024-11-30,175,329!2025-03-13,265,330-->

Since customer jobs, customer pains, and customer gains all can have {{different priorities or severity, so we can rank them}}. Ranking them can be based on {{what you think given that it eventually truly reflects the customers' perspectives}}.  Pains and gains can exist {{on a continuum, are not always absolute or binary}}. For example, {{waiting time for a food order can be a gain if it is faster than expected and a pain if it is slower than expected}}. Pains and gains are also not {{opposite}}, like {{coffee temperature being too low or too high are both pains}}. <!--SR:!2026-06-17,592,310!2024-12-02,177,329!2025-08-29,372,365!2025-10-05,402,365!2025-05-04,261,345!2024-11-25,151,324-->

There are several [common mistakes](#customer%20profile%20common%20mistakes) to be aware of. <!--SR:!2024-05-16,18,269-->

<!--/pytextgen-->

### value map

Products and services is {{simply a list of what you offer}}, and can also include {{supporting products and services}}. It can be {{physical, intangible, digital, or financial}}. It is important to recognize products and services do not {{create value by themselves (no intrinsic values), but in relationship with the customer segment}}. Note that products and services {{can have different relevance to your customers}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-24,209,310!2025-03-28,239,309!2025-06-27,276,269!2025-03-14,220,270!2026-06-29,611,329-->

Pain relievers describe {{how the products or services alleviate customer pains}}. There is no need to {{alleviate every identified pain}}, and instead {{it is better to alleviate some extreme pains extremely well}}. Like products and services, pain relievers {{can have different relevance to your customers}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-12,207,329!2024-11-15,148,309!2025-05-28,285,290!2024-11-20,162,310-->

Gain creators describe {{how the products or services create customer gains}}. There is also no need to {{create every identified gain}}, and instead {{it is better to create some relevant gains extremely well}}. Like products and services, gain creators {{can have different relevance to your customers}}. <!--SR:!2025-06-12,326,349!2025-01-19,200,329!2026-08-29,658,329!2024-12-15,166,309-->

### fit

Fit is when {{your pain relievers relieve customer pains, gain creators create customer gains, and products and services satisfy customer jobs}}. To check fit, {{put two ticks on the pair if there is a matching pair in the customer profile and the value map, and cross out those without any matches}}. A strong fit indicates {{customer satisfaction, market differentiation, and value creation}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-10,164,310!2025-11-22,450,310!2025-02-23,223,345-->

However, checking the fit on paper like above is {{not enough}}. Fit happens in three stages: {{problem–solution fit, product–market fit, and business model fit}}. To achieve these three fits requires {{a nonlinear and iterative process}}. Value proposition design allows quick {{design, test, and repeat}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-26,239,329!2025-02-23,189,249!2025-11-05,431,329!2025-01-08,209,310-->

## design

Design is {{designing business models from your value proposition}}. <!--SR:!2025-04-13,242,289-->

### prototyping

Prototyping is {{making quick study models to explore alternatives and reshape your value propositions}}. <!--SR:!2025-05-31,275,269-->

### interview your customers

Interviewing your customers has several steps:

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("123f", "49ba",),
  R"""
create a customer profile
outline the interview
interview
capture new customer profile
review interview, and repeat from "outline the interview" several times, like 10 times
find customer patterns
""".strip().splitlines(),
)
```

### test card

When designing tests, you can use {{test cards}}. Test cards have {{basic info like name, due date, and person responsible; hypothesis; test; metric; and criteria}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-03,235,330!2025-12-03,412,270-->

One test card is insufficient. Design {{a series of experiments, rank them by cruicalness, and run experiments}}. Note that {{first experiments may invalidate crucial hypotheses that invalidates the rest of the tests}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-20,224,289!2026-01-15,484,329-->

## evolve

Evolve is {{improving and reinvent yourself constantly}}. <!--SR:!2026-07-25,632,329-->
