<!--/pytextgen-->

Value proposition design starts from {{tools, value proposition canvas; design and test; and evolve}}. It is important to note that value proposition design is {{a nonlinear and messy process that gets more linear and clean over time}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-08,15,230!2024-05-26,28,287-->

Value proposition design works for {{both new ventures and established organizations}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-22,34,270-->

## canvas

The value proposition canvas has two parts: {{the customer profile showing your customer understanding and the value map showing your product and its values. Achieve fit by having your product create value that satisfies customers}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-20,22,269-->

The value map itself has three parts: {{products and services, pain relievers, and gain creators}}. It corresponds to the three parts of the customer profile: {{customer jobs, pains, and gains}}. Fit is achieved when {{pain relievers relieve pains and gain creators create gains that are important to the customer}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-04,15,307!2024-07-02,71,310!2024-05-02,13,289-->

### customer profile

Customer jobs can be split into three categories: {{functional jobs, social jobs, and personal or emotional jobs}}. There are also supporting jobs arising from three different roles: {{buyer of value, buying value; co-creator of value, participating in creating value; and transferrer of value, end of lifecycle}}. Note that jobs {{have different priorities}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-19,21,269!2024-05-15,20,269!2024-06-07,39,309-->

Customer pains include {{undesirable things, obstacles, and risks}}. Make pains {{concrete}}. Note that pains {{can have different severity}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-21,33,270!2024-05-06,17,309!2024-05-05,16,309-->

Customer gains can be separated into four levels: {{required, required by customers; expected, expected by customers; desired gains, wanted by customers; and unexpected gains, wanted by customers but customers do not know}}. Make gains {{concrete}}. Like customer pains, note that gains {{can have different severity}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-01,9,249!2024-06-08,40,309!2024-06-21,62,310-->

Since customer jobs, customer pains, and customer gains all can have {{different priorities or severity, so we can rank them}}. Ranking them can be based on {{what you think given that it eventually truly reflects the customers' perspectives}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-11,50,290!2024-06-08,41,309-->

There are several [common mistakes](#customer%20profile%20common%20mistakes) to be aware of. Jobs to be done can be improved by {{asking why repeatedly until you find the root job}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-16,18,269-->

### value map

Products and services is {{simply a list of what you offer}}, and can also include {{supporting products and services}}. It can be {{physical, intangible, digital, or financial}}. It is important to recognize products and services do not {{create value by themselves, but in relationship with the customer segment}}. Note that products and services {{can have different relevance to your customers}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-29,68,310!2024-05-14,20,289!2024-05-08,14,269!2024-05-16,31,270!2024-06-10,43,309-->

Pain relievers describe {{how the products or services alleviate customer pains}}. There is no need to {{alleviate every identified pain}}, and instead {{it is better to alleviate some extreme pains extremely well}}. Like products and services, pain relievers {{can have different relevance to your customers}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-01,12,289!2024-05-04,15,309!2024-05-09,34,290!2024-06-11,53,310-->

Gain creators describe {{how the products or services create customer gains}}. There is also no need to {{create every identified gain}}, and instead {{it is better to create some relevant gains extremely well}}. Like products and services, gain creators {{can have different relevance to your customers}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-06,17,309!2024-05-03,14,309!2024-05-01,13,289!2024-05-07,18,309-->

There are several [common mistakes](#value%20map%20common%20mistakes) to be aware of.

### fit

Fit is when {{your pain relievers relieve customer pains, gain creators create customer gains, and products and services satisfy customer jobs}}. To check fit, {{put two ticks on the pair if there is a matching pair in the customer profile and the value map, and cross out those without any matches}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-30,41,290!2024-05-08,30,270-->

However, checking the fit on paper like above is {{not enough}}. Fit happens in three stages: {{problem–solution fit, product–market fit, and business model fit}}. To achieve these three fits requires {{a nonlinear and iterative process}}. Value proposition design allows quick {{design, test, and repeat}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-06,17,309!2024-05-05,12,249!2024-05-21,26,289!2024-06-13,52,290-->

## design

Design is {{designing business models from your value proposition}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-21,23,269-->

### prototyping

Prototyping is {{making quick study models to explore alternatives and reshape your value propositions}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-08,13,249-->

### interview your customers

Interviewing your customers has several steps:

%%

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("123f", "49ba",),
  R"""
create a customer profile
outline the interview
interview
capture new customer profile
review interview, and repeat from "outline the interview" several times, like 10 times
find customer patterns
""".strip().splitlines(),
)
```

## test

Test is {{reducing risk and uncertainty of new ideas and then improving your value propositions}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-06,13,249-->

### test card

When designing tests, you can use {{test cards}}. Test cards have {{basic info like name, due date, and person responsible; hypothesis; test; metric; and criteria}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-13,55,310!2024-05-01,19,250-->

One test card is insufficient. Design {{a series of experiments, rank them by cruicalness, and run experiments}}. Note that {{first experiments may invalidate crucial hypotheses that invalidates the rest of the tests}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-22,27,289!2024-05-28,28,289-->

## evolve

Evolve is {{improving and reinvent yourself constantly}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-04,37,289-->
