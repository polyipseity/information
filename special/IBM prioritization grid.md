Prepare many ideas. Each idea is a pair of sticky notes, one with drawing, one with title and caption.
Each person evaluate every idea of the whole team on their own. Each person has the same number of votes for "[feasibility for us](#feasibility%20for%20us)" and "[value to the user](#value%20to%20the%20user)" (recommended 4 dot stickers). Vote based on the two qualities.
Draw a grid. The x-axis is "[feasibility for us](#feasibility%20for%20us)" and the y-axis is "[value to the user](#value%20to%20the%20user)". Also mark "low" and "high" on both axes.
Plot the ideas on the graph based on votes.
Discuss the ideas and adjust the plotting, based on relative strength.
Assess the ideas by drawing two arcs, splitting the grid into 3 quadrants. Label the top quadrant "no-brainers", the middle quadrant "big bets" for higher [value](#value%20to%20the%20user) and "utilities" for higher [feasibility](#feasibility%20for%20us), and the bottom quadrant "further exploration".
Focus the discussion around "big bets", though do not completely ignore the other ideas.

## feasibility for us

- questions to ask ::: Does it alleviate user pain? Does it provide user gain? Does it differentiate the product?

## value to the user

- questions to ask ::: Is it achievable as a team? Is it marketable? Is it technically feasible?

## assessment

- assessment example ::: ![assessment example](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240312134839.png)
