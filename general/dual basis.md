# dual basis

In [linear algebra](linear%20algebra.md), given {{a [vector space](vector%20space.md) $V$ with a [basis](basis%20(linear%20algebra).md) indexed by an [index set](index%20set.md) $I$ (with the same [cardinality](cardinality.md) as the [dimension](dimension%20(com).md) of $B$)}}, the {{__dual set__}} of {{$B$ is is a set $B^*$ of vectors in the [dual space](dual%20space.md) $V^*$ with the same index set of $I$ such that $B$ and $B^*$ form a [biorthogonal system](biorthogonal%20system.md)}}. The dual set is {{always [linearly independent](linear%20independence.md) but does not necessarily [span](linear%20span.md) the dual space $V^*$}}. If {{it does span $V^*$}}, then {{$B^*$ is called the __dual basis__ or __reciprocal basis__ for basis $B$}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-23,9,270!2024-07-28,14,290!2024-07-30,16,290!2024-07-26,12,270!2024-07-28,14,290!2024-07-27,13,290-->

Denoting the indexed vector sets as {{$B = \set{v_i}_{i \in I}$ and $B^* = \set{v^i}_{i \in I}$}}, being [biorthogonal system](biorthogonal%20system.md) means {{a pair of two elements taken from each set have an [inner product](inner%20product%20space.md) equal to 1 if the indexes are equal, and 0 otherwise}}. Symbolically, evaluating a basis in the dual space $V^*$ on a basis in the original space $V$: {{$$v^i \cdot v_j = \delta_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if }i = j \\ 0 & \text{if }i \ne j \end{cases}$$, where $\delta_{ij}$ is the [Kronecker delta](Kronecker%20delta.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-28,14,290!2024-07-24,10,270!2024-07-24,10,270-->

> - use of [index set](index%20set.md) $I$ ::: It is a way to encode the [cardinality](cardinality.md) of the set of basis of the [vector space](vector%20space.md) $V$. For a finite number of basis, this is, intuitively, naming each basis by an integer starting from 1. If one does not understand this concept, it can be mostly ignored for finite number of basis. <!--SR:!2024-07-20,6,250!2024-07-27,13,290-->
> - What if the [inner product](inner%20product%20space.md) between a vector and its corresponding dual vector is nonzero but does not equal to 1? ::: One of the vector can be scaled such that the inner product is 1. This does not affect the inner products between a vector and other non-corresponding dual vectors. Consider that the original inner products are 0. Scaling them by any scalar are still 0. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,297!2024-07-18,3,277-->

## introduction

To perform useful operations on vectors, we must have a straightforward way to {{calculate its component individually}}. In {{a finite [Cartesian](Cartesian%20coordinate%20system.md) frame $V$, i.e. the [basis](basis%20(linear%20algebra).md) are [orthonormal](orthonormal%20basis.md)}}, this is easy. For example, a 3-[dimensional](dimension%20(vector%20space).md) vector $$\mathbf x = x_1 \mathbf e_1 + x_2 \mathbf e_2 + x_3 \mathbf e_3$$, where {{$\set{\mathbf e_1, \mathbf e_2, \mathbf e_3}$ is the basis in a Cartesian frame}}. The component of $\mathbf x$ can {{be found by [dot product](dot%20product.md): $$x_k = \mathbf e_k \cdot \mathbf x$$}}, since {{$\mathbf e_i \cdot \mathbf e_i = 1$ and $\mathbf e_i \cdot \mathbf e_j = 0 \quad i \ne j$}}. However, this property does not apply {{in a finite non-Cartesian frame}}. However, it is always possible to {{find another set of _inverse basis_ in $V$, e.g. $\set{\mathbf e'_1, \mathbf e'_2, \mathbf e'_3}$, such that $\mathbf e'_i \cdot \mathbf e_i = 1$ and $\mathbf e'_i \cdot \mathbf e_j = 0 \quad i \ne j$}}, so the equation for a component of $\mathbf x$ becomes {{$$x_k = \mathbf e'_k \cdot \mathbf x$$}}. In matrix form, {{vectors in (and basis of) $V$ are [column vectors](row%20and%20column%20vectors.md), and the above equation is defined in terms of [matrix multiplication](matrix%20multiplcation.md)}} as: {{$$x_k = {\mathbf e'_k}^\intercal \mathbf x$$}}. Notice that {{$\mathbf e'_k$ is [transposed](transposed.md) in the equation}}. In the dual space $V^*$, {{vectors are represented with row vectors instead, so we define $\mathbf e^k = {\mathbf e'_k}^\intercal$}}, and the set of transposes of the inverse basis in $V$, {{e.g. $\set{\mathbf e^1 = {\mathbf e'_1}^\intercal, \mathbf e^2 = {\mathbf e'_2}^\intercal, \mathbf e^3 = {\mathbf e'_3}^\intercal}$, is the _dual set_ of the original set of basis}}. It turns out in a finite-dimensional vector space, {{this dual set is also a _dual basis_, i.e. a basis of $V^*$}}. Indeed, this is how one finds the dual basis in matrix form: {{$$\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf e^1 \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf e^n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf e_1 & \cdots & \mathbf e_n \end{bmatrix}^{-1}$$, or, if you want the dual basis vectors to be column vectors: $$\begin{bmatrix} {\mathbf e^1}^\intercal & \cdots & {\mathbf e^n}^\intercal \end{bmatrix} = \left(\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf e_1 & \cdots & \mathbf e_n \end{bmatrix}^{-1} \right)^\intercal$$}}. Note that using the same procedure on {{infinite-[dimensional](dimension%20(vector%20space).md) vector spaces would yield a _dual set_ but not necessarily a _dual basis_}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-29,15,290!2024-07-27,13,290!2024-07-31,17,290!2024-07-30,16,290!2024-07-29,15,290!2024-07-31,17,290!2024-07-28,14,290!2024-07-28,14,290!2024-07-27,13,290!2024-07-31,17,290!2024-07-30,16,290!2024-07-27,13,290!2024-07-24,10,270!2024-07-24,10,270!2024-07-23,9,270!2024-07-29,15,290-->
