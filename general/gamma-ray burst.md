# gamma-ray burst

In [gamma-ray astronomy](gamma-ray%20astronomy.md), __gamma-ray bursts__ (__GRBs__) are {{immensely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant [galaxies](galaxy.md), being the brightest and most extreme explosive events in the entire universe}}, as [NASA](NASA.md) describes the bursts as {{the "most powerful class of explosions in the universe"}}. They are {{the most energetic and luminous [electromagnetic events](electromagnetic%20pulse.md) since the [Big Bang](Big%20Bang.md)}}. Gamma-ray bursts can last from {{ten milliseconds to several hours}}. After the initial flash of [gamma rays](gamma%20ray.md), {{an "afterglow" is emitted, which is longer lived and usually emitted at longer wavelengths ([X-ray](X-ray.md), [ultraviolet](ultraviolet.md), [optical](visible%20spectrum.md), [infrared](infrared.md), [microwave](microwave.md) and [radio](radio%20wave.md))}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-01,66,310!2025-05-17,214,330!2025-08-05,283,330!2025-08-31,304,330!2025-02-23,153,310-->

The intense radiation of most observed GRBs is thought to be released {{during a [supernova](supernova.md) or [superluminous supernova](superluminous%20supernova.md) as a high-mass [star](star.md) implodes to form a [neutron star](neutron%20star.md) or a [black hole](black%20hole.md)}}. A subclass of GRBs appears to {{originate from the merger of [binary](binary%20star.md) [neutron stars](neutron%20star.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-11,116,250!2024-12-14,83,270-->
