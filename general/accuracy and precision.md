# accuracy and precision

## in classification

### in binary classification

- see: [evaluation of binary classifiers ยง single metrics](evaluation%20of%20binary%20classifiers.md#single%20metrics)

The formula for quantifying binary accuracy is: {{$$\text{accuracy} = \frac {\text{T} } {\text{all} } = \frac {\text{TP} + \text{TN} } {\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN} }$$}}, where {{TP are true positives, TN are true negatives, FP are false positives, and FN are false negatives (see [false positives and false negatives](false%20positives%20and%20false%20negatives.md))}}.
