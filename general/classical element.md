# classical element

## Hellenistic philosophy

### Aristotle

In his [_On Generation and Corruption_](On%20Generation%20and%20Corruption.md), [Aristotle](Aristotle.md) related each of the four elements, {{fire, air, water, and earth}}, to {{two of the four sensible qualities}}: <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,270!2024-07-19,4,270-->

- [__fire__](../../../../general/fire%20(classical%20element).md) ::: both hot and dry <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,270!2024-07-19,4,270-->
- [__air__](../../../../general/air%20(classical%20element).md) ::: both hot and wet (for air is vapor, ἀτμὶς) <!--SR:!2024-07-18,3,250!2024-07-19,4,270-->
- [__water__](../../../../general/water%20(classical%20element).md) ::: both cold and wet <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,270!2024-07-19,4,270-->
- [__earth__](../../../../general/earth%20(classical%20element).md) ::: both cold and dry <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,270!2024-07-18,3,250-->

#### aether

[Aristotle](Aristotle.md) added {{a fifth element, [aether](aether%20(classical element).md#fifth%20element) (αἰθήρ _aither_), as the quintessence}}, reasoning that {{whereas fire, earth, air, and water were earthly and corruptible, since no changes had been perceived in the heavenly regions}}, the [stars](star.md) {{cannot be made out of any of the four elements but must be made of a different, unchangeable, heavenly substance}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,3,250!2024-07-19,4,270!2024-07-19,4,270-->
