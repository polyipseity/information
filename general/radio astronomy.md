# radio astronomy

__Radio astronomy__ is {{a subfield of [astronomy](astronomy.md) that studies [celestial objects](astronomical%20object.md) at [radio frequencies](radio%20frequency.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-30,49,290-->

## techniques

### radio telescopes

- see: [radio telescope](radio%20telescope.md)

Radio telescopes may need to be {{extremely large in order to receive signals with low [signal-to-noise ratio](signal-to-noise%20ratio.md)}}. Also, [angular resolution](angular%20resolution.md) is {{a function of the ratio of the [wavelength](wavelength.md) of the observed [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) $\lambda$ over the [diameter](diameter.md) of the "[objective](objective%20(optics).md)" $D$ ([aperture](aperture.md)), $\theta \approx \sin \theta = 1.22 \lambda / D$}}. Since {{the wavelength of [radio waves](radio%20wave.md) are high, typically larger than 1 mm (1×10<sup>-3</sup>&nbsp;m)}}, so to get the same angular resolution, {{radio telescopes need to be much larger in comparison to their [optical](optical%20telescope.md) counterparts}}. The latter observes {{[visible light](visible%20light.md) that has a wavelength typically between 400 nm (4×10<sup>-7</sup>&nbsp;m) and 700 nm (7×10<sup>-7</sup>&nbsp;m)}}. For example, a 1-meter diameter optical telescope is {{two million times bigger than the wavelength of light observed giving it a resolution of roughly 0.3 [arcseconds](minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc.md)}}, whereas a radio telescope "dish" many times that size may, depending on the wavelength observed, only be able to {{resolve an object the size of the full moon (30 [arcminutes](minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc.md))}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-18,41,290!2024-10-06,55,310!2024-11-25,79,270!2024-10-03,52,310!2024-10-25,72,310!2025-01-07,120,290!2024-09-22,41,290-->
