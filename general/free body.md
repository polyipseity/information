# free body

__Free body__ is {@{usually associated with a [free body diagram](free%20body%20diagram.md)}@}. In such context, a body is "free" {@{when it is singled out from other bodies for static or dynamic analysis}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-22,237,330!2025-01-20,183,310-->

## external and internal forces

For a free body, external forces are those {@{the free body is subjected to and exerted by a _different_ body}@}. Likewise, internal forces are those {@{a part of the free body is subjected to and exerted by a different part of the _same_ body}@}. The latter often arises from {@{deformation of the body}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-21,632,330!2025-02-08,196,310!2025-04-16,256,330-->

Depending on the selection of the free body, the same force in a system can be {@{either external or internal}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-30,241,330-->

## example

For example, say there are 3 objects stacked on top of each other. {@{Any part of the 3-object stack}@} can be a free body, such as {@{the entire body, the object at the middle, or even a part of the object at the middle}@}. In practice, the free body is selected {@{such that it is easiest to analyze the situation, such as having the fewest external forces}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-13,201,310!2025-02-21,214,330!2025-01-17,180,310-->
