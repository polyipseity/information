# free body

__Free body__ is {{usually associated with a [free body diagram](free%20body%20diagram.md)}}. In such context, a body is "free" {{when it is singled out from other bodies for static or dynamic analysis}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-28,55,310!2024-07-20,45,290-->

## external and internal forces

For a free body, external forces are those {{the free body is subjected to and exerted by a _different_ body}}. Likewise, internal forces are those {{a part of the free body is subjected to and exerted by a different part of the _same_ body}}. The latter often arises from {{deformation of the body}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-27,146,310!2024-07-24,49,290!2024-08-02,59,310-->

Depending on the selection of the free body, the same force in a system can be {{either external or internal}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-01,58,310-->

## example

For example, say there are 3 objects stacked on top of each other. {{Any part of the 3-object stack}} can be a free body, such as {{the entire body, the object at the middle, or even a part of the object at the middle}}. In practice, the free body is selected {{such that it is easiest to analyze the situation, such as having the fewest external forces}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-26,50,290!2024-07-22,50,310!2024-07-19,44,290-->
