# static universe

In [cosmology](cosmology.md), a __static universe__ (also referred to as __stationary__, __infinite__, __static infinite__ or __static eternal__) is {{a [cosmological model](physical%20cosmology.md) in which the [universe](universe.md) is both [spatially](space.md) and [temporally](time.md) infinite, and space is neither [expanding](expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md) nor contracting}}. Such a universe {{does not have so-called [spatial curvature](shape%20of%20the%20universe.md); that is to say that it is 'flat' or [Euclidean](Euclidean%20space.md)}}. A static infinite universe was first proposed by {{English astronomer [Thomas Digges](Thomas%20Digges.md) (1546â€“1595)}}.
