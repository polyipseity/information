# photodisintegration

{{__Photodisintegration__ (also called __phototransmutation__, or a __photonuclear reaction__)}} is {{a [nuclear process](nuclear%20reaction.md) in which an [atomic nucleus](atomic%20nucleus.md) absorbs a high-energy [gamma ray](gamma%20ray.md), enters an excited state, and immediately decays by emitting a subatomic particle}}. The incoming gamma ray {{effectively knocks one or more [neutrons](neutron.md), [protons](proton.md), or an [alpha particle](alpha%20particle.md) out of the nucleus}}. The reactions are called {{(γ,n), (γ,p), and (γ,α)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-03,4,270-->
