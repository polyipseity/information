# microscope

A __microscope__ is {{a [laboratory instrument](laboratory%20equipment.md) for examining objects too small to be seen by the [naked eye](naked%20eye.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-20,432,330-->

## types

### optical microscope

- see: [optical microscope](optical%20microscope.md)

A optical microscope contains {{one or more convex [lens](lens.md)}}. The set of lens closer to the object is {{the _objective_ while the remaining set is the _eyepiece_}}. <!--SR:!2024-04-06,250,310!2023-10-03,114,310-->

### electron microscope

- see: [electron microscope](electron%20microscope.md)

The two main types of electron microscopes are {{[transmission electron microscopes](transmission%20electron%20microscope.md) (TEMs) and [scanning electron microscopes](scanning%20electron%20microscope.md) (SEMs)}}. They both have {{electromagnetic and electrostatic lenses}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-14,431,330!2024-05-09,254,310-->

In TEMs, {{high energy (40 to 400 keV)}} [electrons](electron.md) pass through, {{in order, condenser lens, a very thin (less than 100 nm) sample, objective lens, projector lens, and viewing screen}}. Drawbacks of TEMs include {{requiring a very thin sample and an ultra-high [vacuum](vacuum.md) to transmit electrons through and avoid deflection, and the sample may be damaged by fast-moving electrons}}. <!--SR:!2024-04-12,216,290!2023-09-26,63,210!2023-10-22,96,230-->

### scanning probe

- see: [scanning probe microscopy](scanning%20probe%20microscopy.md)

There are many types of scanning probe microscopes. The three main types are {{[atomic force microscopes](atomic%20force%20microscope.md) (AFMs), [near-field scanning optical microscopes](near-field%20scanning%20optical%20microscope.md) (NSOMs or SNOMs, scanning near-field optical microscopes), and [scanning tunneling microscopes](scanning%20tunneling%20microscope.md) (STMs)}}. <!--SR:!2024-01-16,155,250-->

In STMs, {{an extremely sharp [conducting](electrical%20conductor.md) tip is held extremely close to the sample, which must conduct [electric current](electric%20current.md). A [bias](biasing.md) voltage is applied between the tip and the material to allow [electrons](electron.md) to [tunnel](quantum%20tunneling.md) through the [vacuum](vacuum.md) separating them, creating a _tunneling current_}}. It has two modes: {{_constant-height_ mode, requiring a flat surface to avoid crashing the tip, and _constant-current_ mode, requiring a much longer time to adjust the probe position}}. It can also be used to {{manipulate individual [atoms](atom.md) or [molecules](molecule.md)}}. Advantages of STMs include {{not requiring a [vacuum](vacuum.md) in principle (but works better in a vacuum to avoid sample contaimination), producing easier to interpret results, and being simpler and cheaper}}. <!--SR:!2023-10-18,92,230!2024-07-14,302,270!2024-10-22,409,330!2024-01-06,155,250-->
