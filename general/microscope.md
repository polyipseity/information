# microscope

A __microscope__ is {@{a [laboratory instrument](laboratory%20equipment.md) for examining objects too small to be seen by the [naked eye](naked%20eye.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2024-11-20,432,330-->

## types

### optical microscope

- see: [optical microscope](optical%20microscope.md)

A optical microscope contains {@{one or more convex [lens](lens.md)}@}. The set of lens closer to the object is {@{the _objective_ while the remaining set is the _eyepiece_}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-22,774,310!2025-02-16,499,330-->

### electron microscope

- see: [electron microscope](electron%20microscope.md)

The two main types of electron microscopes are {@{[transmission electron microscopes](transmission%20electron%20microscope.md) (TEMs) and [scanning electron microscopes](scanning%20electron%20microscope.md) (SEMs)}@}. They both have {@{electromagnetic and electrostatic lenses}@}. <!--SR:!2028-10-07,1423,330!2026-07-04,786,310-->

In TEMs, {@{high energy (40 to 400 keV)}@} [electrons](electron.md) pass through, {@{in order, condenser lens, a very thin (less than 100 nm) sample, objective lens, projector lens, and viewing screen}@}. Drawbacks of TEMs include {@{requiring a very thin sample and an ultra-high [vacuum](vacuum.md) to transmit electrons through and avoid deflection, and the sample may be damaged by fast-moving electrons}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-28,625,290!2025-04-03,165,170!2025-10-19,505,230-->

### scanning probe

- see: [scanning probe microscopy](scanning%20probe%20microscopy.md)

There are many types of scanning probe microscopes. The three main types are {@{[atomic force microscopes](atomic%20force%20microscope.md) (AFMs), [near-field scanning optical microscopes](near-field%20scanning%20optical%20microscope.md) (NSOMs or SNOMs, scanning near-field optical microscopes), and [scanning tunneling microscopes](scanning%20tunneling%20microscope.md) (STMs)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-02,420,230-->

In STMs, {@{an extremely sharp [conducting](electrical%20conductor.md) tip is held extremely close to the sample, which must conduct [electric current](electric%20current.md). A [bias](biasing.md) voltage is applied between the tip and the material to allow [electrons](electron.md) to [tunnel](quantum%20tunneling.md) through the [vacuum](vacuum.md) separating them, creating a _tunneling current_}@}. It has two modes: {@{_constant-height_ mode, requiring a flat surface to avoid crashing the tip, and _constant-current_ mode, requiring a much longer time to adjust the probe position}@}. It can also be used to {@{manipulate individual [atoms](atom.md) or [molecules](molecule.md)}@}. Advantages of STMs include {@{not requiring a [vacuum](vacuum.md) in principle (but works better in a vacuum to avoid sample contaimination), producing easier to interpret results, and being simpler and cheaper}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-19,484,230!2026-10-06,814,270!2029-11-26,1861,350!2025-01-27,387,250-->
