# strain

In [mechanics](mechanics.md), __stress__ is defined as {{relative [deformation](deformation%20(physics).md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-05,60,310-->

## strain measures

### engineering strain

__Engineering strain__, also known as {{__Cauchy strain__}}, is expressed as {{the ratio of the deformation to the initial dimension on the body}}. For an {{axial object}}, this is {{the _relative elongation_ (symbol: $e$ or $\varepsilon$) or the change in length $\Delta L$ per unit length of the original length $L$}}: {{$$e = \frac {\Delta L} L$$}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-29,55,310!2024-07-22,49,310!2024-07-15,40,290!2024-07-04,34,290!2024-08-13,67,310-->

Strain has {{no units and is dimensionless}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-02,33,290-->
