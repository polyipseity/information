# strain

In [mechanics](mechanics.md), __strain__ is defined as {{relative [deformation](deformation%20(physics).md)}}.

## strain measures

### engineering strain

__Engineering strain__, also known as {{__Cauchy strain__}}, is expressed as {{the ratio of the deformation to the initial dimension on the body}}. For an {{axial object}}, this is {{the _relative elongation_ (symbol: $e$ or $\varepsilon$) or the change in length $\Delta L$ per unit length of the original length $L$}}: {{$$e = \frac {\Delta L} L$$}}.

Strain has {{no units and is dimensionless}}.
