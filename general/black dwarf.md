# black dwarf

A __black dwarf__ is {{a theoretical [stellar remnant](compact%20object.md), specifically a [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md) that has cooled sufficiently to no longer emit significant [heat](heat.md) or [light](light.md)}}. Because {{the time required for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current [age of the universe](age%20of%20the%20universe.md) (13.8 billion years)}}, {{no black dwarfs are expected to exist in the universe at the present time}}. The temperature of the coolest white dwarfs is {{one observational limit on the universe's age}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-12,9,270!2024-08-19,16,290!2024-08-15,12,270!2024-08-16,13,290-->

The name "black dwarf" has also been applied to {{hypothetical late-stage cooled [brown dwarfs](brown%20dwarf.md) – [substellar objects](substellar%20object.md) with insufficient mass (less than approximately 0.07 [M<sub>☉</sub>](solar%20mass.md)) to maintain [hydrogen](hydrogen.md)-burning [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-11,8,250-->
