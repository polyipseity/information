# black dwarf

A __black dwarf__ is {{a theoretical [stellar remnant](compact%20object.md), specifically a [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md) that has cooled sufficiently to no longer emit significant [heat](heat.md) or [light](light.md)}}. Because {{the time required for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current [age of the universe](age%20of%20the%20universe.md) (13.8 billion years)}}, {{no black dwarfs are expected to exist in the universe at the present time}}. The temperature of the coolest white dwarfs is {{one observational limit on the universe's age}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-08,27,270!2024-10-21,63,310!2024-09-19,34,270!2024-09-27,42,290-->

The name "black dwarf" has also been applied to {{hypothetical late-stage cooled [brown dwarfs](brown%20dwarf.md) – [substellar objects](substellar%20object.md) with insufficient mass (less than approximately 0.07 [M<sub>☉</sub>](solar%20mass.md)) to maintain [hydrogen](hydrogen.md)-burning [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-31,63,270-->

## properties and structure

### event horizon

- see: [event horizon](event%20horizon.md)

The defining feature of a black hole is {{the appearance of an event horizon—a boundary in [spacetime](spacetime.md) through which matter and light can pass only inward towards the mass of the black hole}}. {{Nothing, not even light}}, can {{escape from inside the event horizon}}. The event horizon is referred to as such because {{if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine whether such an event occurred}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-12,49,300!2024-10-15,54,320!2024-10-28,66,320!2024-10-11,48,300-->

### singularity

- see: [gravitational singularity](gravitational%20singularity.md)

At the centre of a black hole, as described by {{general relativity}}, {{may lie a [gravitational singularity](gravitational%20singularity.md), a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite}}. For {{a non-rotating black hole}}, this region {{takes the shape of a single point; for a rotating black hole it is smeared out to form a [ring singularity](ring%20singularity.md) that lies in the plane of rotation}}. In both cases, {{the singular region has zero volume}}. It can also be shown that {{the singular region contains all the mass of the black hole solution}}. The singular region can thus be thought of as {{having infinite [density](density.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-07,24,280!2024-10-21,60,320!2024-11-02,70,320!2024-10-16,50,300!2024-10-19,53,300!2024-10-18,57,320!2024-10-28,66,320-->

Observers falling into {{a Schwarzschild black hole (i.e., non-rotating and not charged)}} cannot {{avoid being carried into the singularity once they cross the event horizon}}. They can {{prolong the experience by accelerating away to slow their descent, but only up to a limit}}. When they reach the singularity, {{they are crushed to infinite density and their mass is added to the total of the black hole}}. Before that happens, they will {{have been torn apart by the growing [tidal forces](tidal%20force.md) in a process sometimes referred to as [spaghettification](spaghettification.md) or the "noodle effect"}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-06,23,280!2024-09-19,31,280!2024-10-12,54,300!2024-11-11,76,320!2024-10-03,46,300-->
