# Cepheid variable

{{A __Cepheid variable__}} ({{[/ˈsɛfi.ɪd, ˈsiːfi-/]}}) is {{a type of [variable star](variable%20star.md) that [pulsates radially](instability%20strip.md), varying in both diameter and temperature}}. It changes {{in brightness, with a well-defined stable [period](frequency.md) and amplitude}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-22,12,270!2024-08-23,13,290!2024-08-21,11,270!2024-08-23,13,290-->

Cepheids are {{important cosmic benchmarks for scaling [galactic and extragalactic distances](cosmic%20distance%20ladder.md)}}. A strong direct [relationship](period-luminosity%20relation.md) exists between {{a Cepheid variable's [luminosity](luminosity.md) and its [pulsation period](periodic%20function.md)}}. Cepheids change {{brightness due to the [κ–mechanism](kappa–mechanism.md), which occurs when opacity in a star increases with temperature rather than decreasing}}. The main gas involved is {{thought to be helium}}. First, {{the outer layer of the star contracts}}, heating {{due to compression until the helium [doubly ionizes](double%20ionization.md), becoming much more opaque}}. This causes it to {{accumulate heat, causing a build-up of pressure that forces the layer back out again until it cools enough to become singly ionized again}}. The helium, {{now transparent and not accumulating as much heat and pressure}}, {{contracts again to restart the cycle}}. Cepheid variables become {{dimmest during the part of the cycle when the helium is doubly ionized}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-22,12,270!2024-08-25,15,290!2024-08-22,12,270!2024-08-25,15,290!2024-08-25,15,290!2024-08-23,13,270!2024-08-20,10,270!2024-08-25,15,290!2024-08-26,16,290!2024-08-27,17,290-->

This characteristic of classical Cepheids was {{discovered in 1908 by [Henrietta Swan Leavitt](Henrietta%20Swan%20Leavitt.md)}} after {{studying thousands of variable stars in the [Magellanic Clouds](Magellanic%20Clouds.md)}}. The discovery {{establishes the _true luminosity_ of a Cepheid by observing its pulsation period}}. This in turn {{gives the distance to the star by comparing its known luminosity to its observed brightness}}, calibrated by {{directly observing the [parallax](parallax%20in%20astronomy.md) distance to the closest Cepheids such as RS Puppis and [Polaris](polaris.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-18,4,210!2024-08-21,11,270!2024-08-24,14,290!2024-08-20,10,270!2024-08-19,9,270-->

The term _Cepheid_ originates from {{[Delta Cephei](Delta%20Cephei.md) in the constellation [Cepheus](Cepheus%20(constellation).md)}}, identified by {{[John Goodricke](John%20Goodricke.md) in 1784}}. It was {{the first of its type to be identified}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-19,9,270!2024-08-22,8,230!2024-08-24,14,290-->
