# Cepheid variable

{{A __Cepheid variable__}} ({{[/ˈsɛfi.ɪd, ˈsiːfi-/]}}) is {{a type of [variable star](variable%20star.md) that [pulsates radially](instability%20strip.md), varying in both diameter and temperature}}. It changes {{in brightness, with a well-defined stable [period](frequency.md) and amplitude}}. <!--SR:!2025-04-14,188,310!2025-05-22,219,330!2025-02-12,127,290!2025-01-14,106,290-->

Cepheids are {{important cosmic benchmarks for scaling [galactic and extragalactic distances](cosmic%20distance%20ladder.md)}}. A strong direct [relationship](period-luminosity%20relation.md) exists between {{a Cepheid variable's [luminosity](luminosity.md) and its [pulsation period](periodic%20function.md)}}. Cepheids change {{brightness due to the [κ–mechanism](kappa–mechanism.md), which occurs when opacity in a star increases with temperature rather than decreasing}}. The main gas involved is {{thought to be helium}}. First, {{the outer layer of the star contracts}}, heating {{due to compression until the helium [doubly ionizes](double%20ionization.md), becoming much more opaque}}. This causes it to {{accumulate heat, causing a build-up of pressure that forces the layer back out again until it cools enough to become singly ionized again}}. The helium, {{now transparent and not accumulating as much heat and pressure}}, {{contracts again to restart the cycle}}. Cepheid variables become {{dimmest during the part of the cycle when the helium is doubly ionized}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-16,84,270!2025-07-15,263,330!2024-12-28,93,270!2025-07-11,260,330!2025-04-26,185,310!2024-12-30,94,270!2024-11-12,61,270!2024-10-26,60,310!2024-10-29,63,310!2025-05-02,199,310-->

This characteristic of classical Cepheids was {{discovered in 1908 by [Henrietta Swan Leavitt](Henrietta%20Swan%20Leavitt.md)}} after {{studying thousands of variable stars in the [Magellanic Clouds](Magellanic%20Clouds.md)}}. The discovery {{establishes the _true luminosity_ of a Cepheid by observing its pulsation period}}. This in turn {{gives the distance to the star by comparing its known luminosity to its observed brightness}}, calibrated by {{directly observing the [parallax](parallax%20in%20astronomy.md) distance to the closest Cepheids such as RS Puppis and [Polaris](polaris.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-20,97,230!2025-02-01,121,290!2025-03-25,168,310!2024-11-24,70,270!2024-11-17,66,270-->

The term _Cepheid_ originates from {{[Delta Cephei](Delta%20Cephei.md) in the constellation [Cepheus](Cepheus%20(constellation).md)}}, identified by {{[John Goodricke](John%20Goodricke.md) in 1784}}. It was {{the first of its type to be identified}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-04,55,270!2025-01-31,100,230!2025-07-15,265,330-->
