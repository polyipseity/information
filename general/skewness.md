# skewness

In [probability theory](probability%20theory.md) and [statistics](statistics.md), __skewness__ is {@{a measure of the asymmetry of the [probability distribution](probability%20distribution.md) of a [real](real%20number.md)-valued [random variable](random%20variable.md) about its mean}@}. The skewness value can be {@{positive, zero, negative, or undefined}@}. <!--SR:!2024-11-15,57,310!2024-12-04,73,310-->

For {@{a [unimodal](unimodality.md) distribution (a distribution with a single peak)}@}, negative skew {@{_commonly_ indicates that the _tail_ is on the left side of the distribution, and positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right}@}. In cases {@{where one tail is long but the other tail is fat}@}, skewness {@{does not obey a simple rule}@}. For example, a zero value in skewness means that {@{the tails on both sides of the mean balance out _overall_}@}; this is the case for {@{a symmetric distribution but can also be true for an asymmetric distribution where one tail is long and thin, and the other is short but fat}@}. Thus, {@{the judgement on the symmetry of a given distribution by using only its skewness}@} is {@{risky; the distribution shape must be taken into account}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,230,330!2025-05-02,182,310!2024-11-16,58,310!2025-04-07,164,310!2025-07-16,245,330!2024-11-17,59,310!2025-06-27,229,330!2025-03-20,147,310-->

## relationship of mean and median

The skewness is {@{not directly related to the relationship between the mean and median: a distribution with negative skew can have its mean greater than or less than the median, and likewise for positive skew}@}. <!--SR:!2024-11-23,62,310-->

In {@{the older notion of [nonparametric skew](nonparametric%20skew.md)}@}, defined as {@{$(\mu -\nu )/\sigma ,$ where $\mu$ is the [mean](mean.md), $\nu$ is the [median](median.md), and $\sigma$ is the [standard deviation](standard%20deviation.md)}@}, the skewness is {@{defined in terms of this relationship: positive/right nonparametric skew means the mean is greater than (to the right of) the median, while negative/left nonparametric skew means the mean is less than (to the left of) the median}@}. However, {the modern definition of skewness and the traditional nonparametric definition {@{do not always have the same sign: while they agree for some families of distributions, they differ in some of the cases, and conflating them is misleading}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-03,72,310!2024-11-21,60,310!2024-12-28,86,290!2025-05-04,174,310-->

If {@{the distribution is [symmetric](symmetric%20probability%20distribution.md)}@}, then {@{the mean is equal to the median, and the distribution has zero skewness}@}. If {@{the distribution is both symmetric and [unimodal](unimodality.md#unimodal%20probability%20distribution)}@}, then {@{the [mean](mean.md) = [median](median.md) = [mode](mode%20(statistics).md)}@}. This is the case of {@{a coin toss or the series 1,2,3,4,...}@} Note, however, that {@{the converse is not true in general, i.e. zero skewness (defined below) does not imply that the mean is equal to the median}@}. <!--SR:!2024-11-14,56,310!2024-11-29,68,310!2025-07-01,233,330!2024-12-02,71,310!2024-11-25,64,310!2025-06-22,225,330-->
