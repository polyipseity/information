# alkaline fuel cell

%%

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../tools/utility.py.md
```

%%

The __alkaline fuel cell__ (__AFC__) is {{a [fuel cell](fuel%20cell.md) that consumes [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) and pure [oxygen](oxygen.md) to produce [water](water.md), [electricity](electricity.md), and [heat](heat.md)}}. It has an efficiency of {{70%}}.

## chemistry

Energy is produced through {{a [redox reaction](redox%20reaction.md) between [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) and [oxygen](oxygen.md) in hot concentrated [alkaline](alkali.md) [electrolyte](electrolyte.md) such as [potassium hydroxide](potassium%20hydroxide.md) with a temperature in between ambient temperature and 90 °C}}:

> - [anode](anode.md) ::: H<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2OH<sup>-</sup>(aq) → 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + 2e<sup>-</sup>
> - [cathode](cathode.md) ::: O<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + 4e<sup>-</sup> → 4OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)
> - overall ::: 2H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

Electrodes {{are porous to allow hydrogen, oxygen, and [water](water.md) to flow in and out. They are made of [nickel](nickel.md) or [platinum](platinum.md) to catalyze the redox reaction}}.

Pure oxygen is needed {{to avoid poisoning the fuel cell by converting potassium hydroxide into [potassium carbonate](potassium%20carbonate.md)}}.

## advantages and disadvantages

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects('d929', 'afb9'),
  (
    '+: efficiency as high as 70%',
    '+: operate continuously, producing a stable supply of [electricity](electricity.md)',
    '+: products, which consist of [water](water.md), are clean',
    '-: expensive',
    '-: storage of [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) and [oxygen](oxygen.md) gas is difficult',
  ),
