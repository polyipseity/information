# consultant

Consultants generally have {{some influence over an entity but no direct power to decide or implement}}. Common examples include {{staff or support roles, even if their job titles do not contain "consultants"}}. In general, their jobs are {{finding what is wrong, making it right practically, and selling the solutions to the client}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-25,17,290!2024-08-01,40,290!2024-07-28,37,290-->
