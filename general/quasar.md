# quasar

A __quasar__ (/ˈkweɪzɑːr/ _KWAY-zar_) is {{an extremely [luminous](luminosity.md) [active galactic nucleus](active%20galactic%20nucleus.md) (AGN)}}. It is sometimes known as {{a __quasi-stellar object__, abbreviated __QSO__}}. The emission from an AGN is {{powered by a [supermassive black hole](supermassive%20black%20hole.md) with a mass ranging from millions to tens of billions of [solar masses](solar%20mass.md), surrounded by a gaseous [accretion disc](accretion%20disk.md)}}. Gas in the disc {{falling towards the black hole heats up and releases [energy](energy.md) in the form of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md)}}. The [radiant energy](radiant%20energy.md) of quasars is {{enormous}}; the most powerful quasars have {{[luminosities](luminosity.md) thousands of times greater than that of a [galaxy](galaxy.md) such as the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md)}}. Quasars are usually categorized as {{a subclass of the more general category of AGN}}. The [redshifts](redshift.md) of quasars are {{of [cosmological origin](expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-06,60,310!2024-10-30,55,310!2025-01-27,109,290!2025-04-13,180,310!2024-12-18,86,290!2025-04-09,172,310!2025-03-07,150,310!2024-11-07,61,310-->

Quasar discovery surveys have shown that {{quasar activity was more common in the distant past; the peak epoch was approximately 10 billion years ago}}. Concentrations of multiple quasars are known as {{[large quasar groups](large%20quasar%20group.md)}} and may {{constitute some of the [largest known structures](galaxy%20filament.md) in the universe if the observed groups are good tracers of mass distribution}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,140,310!2024-11-17,56,250!2024-11-24,66,270-->
