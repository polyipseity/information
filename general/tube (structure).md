# tube

## concept

The tube system acts like {{a non-perforated vertical [cantilevered](cantilever.md) tube, but with reduced stiffness due to openings along the external wall}}. When subject to {{bending by lateral forces}}, {{columns windward and leeward (opposite side of windward) experience tension and compression}}, while {{the frame (beams and columns) parallel to the force are subject to in-plane bending}}.

The exterior structure is {{a very stiff rigid frame with closely spaced columns around the perimeter (usually 2 m to 4 m), making a tube}}. The materials can be {{reinforced concrete or steel}}. Since the columns and beams are {{so closely spaced, the facade looks like a wall with perforated window openings}}. The interior structure are {{mostly columns and usually relatively few in numbers}}. The exterior supports {{some gravity loading and all lateral loading, while the interior supports some gravity loading}}.

## variations

Example variations include {{the (original) framed tube, braced/trussed tube, bundled tube, and tube-in-tube}} systems.

Example buildings include {{Chicago's DeWitt-Chestnut Apartments (framed tube)}}, {{Hopewell Center (tube-in-tube)}}, {{Chicago's 100-storey John-Hancock Building (braced/trussed tube)}}, and {{Chicago's Sears Towers (bundled tube)}}.
