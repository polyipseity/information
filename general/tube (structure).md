# tube

## concept

The tube system acts like {{a non-perforated vertical [cantilevered](cantilever.md) tube, but with reduced stiffness due to openings along the external wall}}. When subject to {{bending by lateral forces}}, {{columns windward and leeward (opposite side of windward) experience tension and compression}}, while {{the frame (beams and columns) parallel to the force are subject to in-plane bending}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-19,191,270!2024-12-25,142,270!2025-03-10,210,310!2025-07-03,280,290-->

The exterior structure is {{a very stiff rigid frame with closely spaced columns around the perimeter (usually 2 m to 4 m), making a tube}}. The materials can be {{reinforced concrete or steel}}. Since the columns and beams are {{so closely spaced, the facade looks like a wall with perforated window openings}}. The interior structure are {{mostly columns and usually relatively few in numbers}}. The exterior supports {{some gravity loading and all lateral loading, while the interior supports some gravity loading}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-03,135,290!2025-01-22,146,270!2024-11-03,126,290!2024-12-06,141,290!2025-08-22,331,290-->

## variations

Example variations include {{the (original) framed tube, braced/trussed tube, bundled tube, and tube-in-tube}} systems. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,187,270-->

Example buildings include {{Chicago's DeWitt-Chestnut Apartments (framed tube)}}, {{Hopewell Center (tube-in-tube)}}, {{Chicago's 100-storey John-Hancock Building (braced/trussed tube)}}, and {{Chicago's Sears Towers (bundled tube)}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-21,200,270!2024-12-07,76,250!2024-11-14,68,250!2025-04-21,201,290-->
