## formal definition

Area can be defined {{from [axioms](axiom.md)}}. Area is {{a [function](function%20(mathematics).md) from a collection $M$ of measurable sets, for some definition of measurability, to the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ ($a: M \to \mathbb{R}$) satisfying the following properties}}:

It can be proved that {{such a function actually exists}}. An example is {{the [Jordan content](Peano–Jordan%20measure.md)}}. However, it is {{not a true [measure](measure%20(mathematics).md) and thus is less well-behaved with infinite countable sets, so [Lebesgue measure](Lebesgue%20measure.md) is more commonly used}}.
