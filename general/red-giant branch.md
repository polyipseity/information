# red-giant branch

## evolution

### ascending the red-giant branch

Stars at {{the foot of the red-giant branch}} all have {{a similar temperature around 5&nbsp;000 [K](Kelvin.md), corresponding to an early to mid-K spectral type}}. Their luminosities {{range from a few times the luminosity of the sun for the least massive red giants to several thousand times as luminous for stars around 8 M<sub>☉</sub>}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,172,310!2025-01-12,119,290!2024-12-19,78,230-->

As {{their hydrogen shells continue to produce more helium}}, the cores of RGB stars {{increase in mass and temperature}}. This causes {{the hydrogen shell to fuse more rapidly}}. Stars become {{more luminous, larger and somewhat cooler on the surface. They are described as ascending the RGB}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-14,145,310!2025-04-18,192,310!2024-12-05,82,270!2025-04-03,184,310-->

On the ascent of the RGB, there are {{a number of internal events that produce observable external features}}. The outer [convective envelope](convection%20zone.md) becomes {{deeper and deeper as the star grows and shell energy production increases}}. Eventually it {{reaches deep enough to bring fusion products to the surface from the formerly convective core, known as the first [dredge-up](dredge-up.md)}}. This changes {{the surface abundance of helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen}}. {{A noticeable clustering of stars at one point on the RGB}} can be detected and is known as {{the RGB bump}}. It is caused by {{a discontinuity in hydrogen abundance left behind by the deep convection}}. Shell {{energy production temporarily decreases at this discontinuity, effective stalling the ascent of the RGB and causing an excess of stars at that point}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-10,144,310!2024-11-14,69,270!2024-11-08,68,270!2024-12-18,90,270!2024-12-11,96,290!2024-10-16,60,310!2024-11-08,64,270!2024-12-17,90,270-->

### leaving the red-giant branch

A degenerate core {{begins fusion explosively in an event known as the [helium flash](helium%20flash.md)}}, but {{externally there is little immediate sign of it}}. The energy is {{consumed in lifting the degeneracy in the core}}. The star overall {{becomes less luminous and hotter and migrates to the horizontal branch}}. All degenerate helium cores {{have approximately the same mass, regardless of the total stellar mass}}, so {{the helium fusion luminosity on the horizontal branch is the same}}. Hydrogen shell fusion can {{cause the total stellar luminosity to vary}}, but for {{most stars at near solar metallicity, the temperature and luminosity are very similar at the cool end of the horizontal branch}}. These stars form {{the [red clump](red%20clump.md) at about 5&nbsp;000 K and 50 L<sub>☉</sub>}}. Less massive hydrogen envelopes cause {{the stars to take up a hotter and less luminous position on the horizontal branch}}, and this effect occurs {{more readily at low metallicity so that old metal-poor clusters show the most pronounced horizontal branches}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-29,70,310!2024-10-18,61,310!2024-10-09,53,310!2024-10-27,59,270!2024-12-18,99,290!2024-10-26,58,270!2024-10-31,62,270!2024-11-02,44,210!2025-01-26,110,250!2024-10-21,35,190!2024-11-03,47,230-->

Stars {{initially more massive than 2 M<sub>☉</sub>}} have {{non-degenerate helium cores on the red-giant branch}}. These stars {{become hot enough to start triple-alpha fusion before they reach the tip of the red-giant branch and before the core becomes degenerate}}. They then leave the red-giant branch and {{perform a [blue loop](blue%20loop.md) before returning to join the asymptotic giant branch}}. Stars only a little more massive than 2 M<sub>☉</sub> {{perform a barely noticeable blue loop at a few hundred L<sub>☉</sub> before continuing on the AGB hardly distinguishable from their red-giant branch position}}. More massive stars {{perform extended blue loops which can reach 10&nbsp;000 K or more at luminosities of thousands of L<sub>☉</sub>}}. These stars will {{cross the [instability strip](instability%20strip.md) more than once and pulsate as [Type I (Classical) Cepheid variables](classical%20Cepheid%20variable.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-26,84,290!2024-10-15,46,250!2024-10-25,55,270!2024-11-27,66,230!2024-12-04,71,230!2024-10-22,51,250!2024-12-01,86,290-->
