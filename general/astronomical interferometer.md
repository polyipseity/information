# astronomical interferometer

An __astronomical interferometer__ or __telescope array__ is {{a set of separate [telescopes](telescope.md), [mirror](mirror.md) segments, or [radio telescope](radio%20telescope.md) antennas that work together as a single telescope to provide higher resolution images of astronomical objects such as [stars](star.md), [nebulas](nebula.md) and [galaxies](galaxy.md) by means of [interferometry](interferometry.md)}}. The advantage of this technique is that {{it can theoretically produce images with the [angular resolution](angular%20resolution.md) of a huge telescope with an aperture equal to the separation, called ___baseline___, between the component telescopes}}. The main drawback is that {{it does not collect as much light as the hypothetical complete instrument}}. Thus it is mainly useful for {{fine resolution of more luminous astronomical objects, such as close [binary stars](binary%20star.md)}}. Another drawback is that {{the maximum [angular size](angular%20diameter.md) of a detectable emission source is limited by the minimum gap (baseline) between detectors in the collector array}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-13,17,290!2024-10-12,61,310!2024-09-23,43,290!2024-10-03,54,310!2024-09-09,32,270-->
