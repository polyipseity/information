>     - {{$f_r$ is the received [frequency](frequency.md), $f_s$ is the source [frequency](frequency.md), and $c$ is the [phase velocity](phase%20velocity.md) of the [wave](wave.md) in the [medium](transmission%20medium.md)}}
>     - {{$\pm v_r$ is the [speed](speed.md) of the receiver relative to the [medium](transmission%20medium.md), positive when moving towards the source and negative when moving away from the source; $\pm v_s$ is the [speed](speed.md) of the source relative to the [medium](transmission%20medium.md), positive when moving away from the receiver and negative when moving towards the receiver}}
