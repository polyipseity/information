# Doppler effect

## general

>
> - where
>   - {{$f_r$ is the received [frequency](frequency.md), $f_s$ is the source [frequency](frequency.md), and $c$ is the [phase velocity](phase%20velocity.md) of the [wave](wave.md) in the [medium](transmission%20medium.md)}}
>   - {{$\mp v_r$ is the [speed](speed.md) of the receiver relative to the [medium](transmission%20medium.md), positive when moving towards the source and negative when moving away from the source; $\pm v_s$ is the [speed](speed.md) of the source relative to the [medium](transmission%20medium.md), positive when moving away from the receiver and negative when moving towards the receiver}}
> - conditions: {{the [relative speed](relative%20velocity.md) is negligible compared to the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md) in [vacuum](vacuum.md), otherwise [relativistic Doppler effect](relativistic%20Doppler%20effect.md) arises}} <!--SR:!2024-01-22,27,270!2024-03-07,65,310!2024-02-21,38,230!2024-03-01,59,310-->
