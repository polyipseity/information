## overview of OLAP systems

### aggregations

OLAP uses {{aggregation to improve performance}}. It {{is generated from the [fact table](fact%20tablee.md) with different granularity by aggregating data along the collapsed dimensions using an [aggregate function](aggregate%20function.md)}}. The number of possible aggregations is {{determined by the number of possible combination of ways to collapse different dimensions}}. <!--SR:!2025-05-27,265,330!2024-09-14,57,250!2024-12-08,129,290-->

Because usually there are {{too many possible aggregations that can be calculated}}, often {{only a predetermined number or those that are within a certain size are calculated; the rest are solved on demand}}. The problem of {{selecting aggregations (or views) to calculate is known as the [view selection or materialization problem](materialized%20view.md#algorithms)}}. View selection can be constrained by {{the number of views, the total size of the views, time to update the views from the base data, an arbitrary combination of the above, etc.}} The objective is {{to minimize the average time to answer OLAP queries, or alternatively minimize update time}}. View selection is {{[NP-complete](NP-completeness.md)}}. A variety of [algorithms](materialized%20view.md#algorithms) have been explored, such as {{[greedy algorithms](greedy%20algorithm.md), randomized search, [genetic algorithms](genetic%20algorithm.md), and [A* search algorithm](A*%20search%20algorithm.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-30,144,310!2024-12-10,131,290!2025-03-02,196,310!2024-09-21,70,290!2025-05-17,258,330!2024-09-16,73,310!2024-10-02,72,270-->
