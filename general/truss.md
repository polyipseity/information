# truss

## characteristics

A truss consists of {{typically (but not necessarily) straight members connected at joints or nodes}}. Trusses are typically (but not necessarily) composed of {{triangles (triangular units) because of its stability}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-18,4,270-->

The joints are likely {{pinned support}}, so they can {{resist translation but not rotation}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-18,4,270-->

## analysis

To {{simplify analysis}}, {{2}} assumptions are often made: {{external forces and reaction are considered to act at joints only and the weights of truss members are negligible compared to the applied loads}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-17,3,250-->

Under these assumptions, each truss member {{must have only 2 forces acting upon it at the end joints, which must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (but they are not [actionâ€”reaction pair](reaction%20(physics).md))}}. By this, each truss member is {{either in tension (positive values) or compression (negative values)}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-18,4,270-->

To analyze a truss, {{design the truss and determine the support sizes}}. Then calculate {{the support reactions and member forces under a specific loading condition}} to {{confirm that the supports and members are strong enough}}. In detail, solve for {{the support reactions by considering the entire truss as a free body}}. Next, {{solve for [forces in all members](#forces%20in%20members)}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-18,4,270-->

### forces in members

There are {{2}} common methods to determine forces in members: {{[method of joints](#method%20of%20joints), suitable for determining forces in all members; and method of sections, suitable for determining forces in some particular members}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-17,3,250-->

Note that some members can have {{zero forces, i.e. neither in tension nor in compression, which are called [zero force members](zero%20force%20member.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-18,4,270-->

#### method of joints

The principle is simple: {{Consider the equilibrium of each joint one by one, starting with those with 2 or less unknown forces}}. For each joint, {{draw the [free body diagram](free%20body%20diagram.md), and determine the axial forces of members connected to the joint}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-17,3,250!2024-05-18,4,270-->

Note that when a truss member is in tension, it is actually {{pulling on the two joints instead of pushing them}}, and vice versa for compression. <!--SR:!2024-05-18,4,270-->

The steps are {{label all joints, members, and the support reactions}}. Then, {{compute the support reactions by considering the entire truss}}. Finally, use {{the method of joints to determine forces in all members}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-18,4,270-->

Note that after finishing with the method of joints, there is {{no need to consider the global (the entire truss) equilibrium again}}. This is because {{the global equilibrium is automatically satisfied afterwards}}, given that {{the calculations are done correctly}}. So this can also serve as a way to {{check the by-hand calculations}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-18,4,270!2024-05-18,4,270-->
