# truss

## characteristics

A truss consists of {@{typically (but not necessarily) straight members connected at joints or nodes}@}. Trusses are typically (but not necessarily) composed of {@{triangles (triangular units) because of its stability}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-10,152,310!2024-11-20,136,310-->

The joints are likely {@{pinned support}@}, so they can {@{resist translation but not rotation}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-03,268,330!2025-05-04,269,330-->

## analysis

To {@{simplify analysis}@}, {@{2}@} assumptions are often made: {@{external forces and reaction are considered to act at joints only and the weights of truss members are negligible compared to the applied loads}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-20,160,310!2025-03-10,226,330!2026-04-08,507,310-->

Under these assumptions, each truss member {@{must have only 2 forces acting upon it at the end joints, which must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (but they are not [actionâ€”reaction pair](reaction%20(physics).md))}@}. By this, each truss member is {@{either a [zero force member](zero%20force%20member.md) (0), in tension (positive values), or in compression (negative values)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,222,330!2024-11-29,144,310-->

To analyze a truss, {@{design the truss and determine the support sizes}@}. Then calculate {@{the support reactions and member forces under a specific loading condition}@} to {@{confirm that the supports and members are strong enough}@}. In detail, solve for {@{the support reactions by considering the entire truss as a free body}@}. Next, {@{solve for [forces in all members](#forces%20in%20members)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-24,176,310!2025-03-25,238,330!2025-04-02,244,330!2025-01-24,186,310!2025-06-13,301,330-->

### forces in members

There are {@{2}@} common methods to determine forces in members: {@{[method of joints](#method%20of%20joints), suitable for determining forces in all members; and method of sections, suitable for determining forces in some particular members}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-23,261,330!2025-01-21,187,310-->

Note that some members can have {@{zero forces, i.e. neither in tension nor in compression, which are called [zero force members](zero%20force%20member.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-27,264,330-->

#### method of joints

The principle is simple: {@{Consider the equilibrium of each joint one by one, starting with those with 2 or less unknown forces}@}. For each joint, {@{draw the [free body diagram](free%20body%20diagram.md), and determine the axial forces of members connected to the joint}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-02,196,310!2025-04-06,246,330-->

Note that when a truss member is in tension, it is actually {@{pulling on the two joints instead of pushing them}@}, and vice versa for compression. <!--SR:!2025-06-16,304,330-->

The steps are {@{label all joints, members, and the support reactions}@}. Then, {@{compute the support reactions by considering the entire truss}@}. Finally, use {@{the method of joints to determine forces in all members}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-04,192,310!2025-04-08,248,330!2024-12-18,158,310-->

Note that after finishing with the method of joints, there is {@{no need to consider the global (the entire truss) equilibrium again}@}. This is because {@{the global equilibrium is automatically satisfied afterwards}@}, given that {@{the calculations are done correctly}@}. So this can also serve as a way to {@{check the by-hand calculations}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-17,256,330!2025-03-05,221,330!2025-01-27,192,310!2026-01-12,445,310-->
