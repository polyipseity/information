# binary system

A __binary system__ is {{a system of two [astronomical bodies](astronomical%20object.md) of the same kind that are comparable in size}}. Definitions {{vary, but typically require the [center of mass](center%20of%20mass.md) ([barycenter](barycenter%20(astronomy).md)) to be located outside of either object}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-14,63,310!2024-10-10,59,310-->

## classification

Binary systems can also be classified based on {{how we see them}}. {{__Visual binaries__}} are two objects {{separate enough that they can be distinguished through binoculars or a small telescope}}. {{__Eclipsing binaries__}} are two objects {{that have an [orbit](orbit.md) inclined such that when one passes in front of another other, an [eclipse](eclipse.md) is seen from [Earth](Earth.md)}}. They also periodically undergo {{a dip in its light curve when an eclipse happens}}. {{__Spectroscopic binaries__}} are two objects {{that can have its binary nature detected using spectroscopy (e.g. [Doppler effect](Doppler%20effect.md))}} <!--SR:!2024-10-01,52,310!2024-09-19,40,290!2024-10-19,68,310!2024-10-13,62,310!2024-10-17,66,310!2024-10-20,67,310!2024-09-22,41,290!2024-09-02,27,270-->
