# Eddington luminosity

The {{__Eddington luminosity__, also referred to as the __Eddington limit__}}, is {{the maximum [luminosity](luminosity.md) a body (such as a [star](star.md)) can achieve when there is balance between the force of radiation acting outward and the [gravitational force](gravity.md) acting inward}}.
