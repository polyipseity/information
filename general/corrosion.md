# corrosion

__Corrosion__ is {{a type of [erosion](erosion.md) that deteriorates [materials](material.md) by [chemical reaction](chemical%20reaction.md) with their environment}}.

It most commonly refers to {{the [electrochemical](electrochemistry.md) [oxidation](oxidation.md) of [metal](metal.md) by an [oxidizing agent](oxidizing%20agent.md) like [oxygen](oxygen.md), [hydrogen](hydrogen.md), or [hydroxide](hydroxide.md)}}. {{[Rusting](rust.md)}} is an well-known example of this.

## resistance

### passivation

- see: [passivation (chemistry)](passivation%20(chemistry).md)

Passivation involves {{the formation of an ultrathin corrosion products on the surface that prevents further [oxidization](oxidization.md)}}. It can be found in {{[aluminium](aluminium.md), [stainless steel](stainless%20steel.md), etc.}}

The layer can be thicken via {{[anodization](#anodization)}}.

## protection

### anodization

- see: [anodizing](anodizing.md)

Anodization {{increases the thickness of the natural [oxide](oxide.md) layer formed by [passivation](#passivation)}}. The object {{becomes more corrosion-resistant and can be [dyed](dyeing.md) in the process}}.

[Aluminium](aluminium.md) can be anodized by {{making it the [anode](anode.md) of an [electrolytic cell](electrolytic%20cell.md) in [sulfuric acid](sulfuric%20acid.md)}}.
