# star cluster

__Star clusters__ are {{large groups of [stars](star.md) held together by [self-gravitation](self-gravitation.md)}}. {{Two main types}} of star clusters can be distinguished. {{[Globular clusters](#globular%20cluster)}} are {{tight groups of ten thousand to millions of old stars which are [gravitationally](gravity.md) bound}}. {{[Open clusters](#open%20cluster)}} are {{more loosely clustered groups of stars, generally containing fewer than a few hundred members, that are often very young}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-11,15,290!2024-08-12,16,290!2024-08-13,17,290!2024-08-07,11,270!2024-08-09,13,290!2024-08-11,15,290-->

## astronomical significance

Clusters are also {{a crucial step in determining the [distance scale of the universe](cosmic%20distance%20ladder.md)}}. A few of the nearest clusters are {{close enough for their distances to be measured using [parallax](stellar%20parallax.md)}}. {{A [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md) can be plotted}} for {{these clusters which has [absolute values](absolute%20magnitude.md) known on the [luminosity](luminosity.md) axis}}. Then, when similar diagram is plotted for {{a cluster whose distance is not known, the position of the main sequence can be compared to that of the first cluster and the distance estimated}}. This process is known as {{_main-sequence fitting_}}. {{[Reddening](extinction%20(astronomy).md) and [stellar populations](stellar%20population.md)}} must be accounted for when using this method. <!--SR:!2024-08-13,17,290!2024-08-09,13,290!2024-08-06,10,270!2024-08-12,16,290!2024-08-08,12,270!2024-08-12,16,290!2024-08-10,14,290-->
