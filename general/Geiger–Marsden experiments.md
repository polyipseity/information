# Geiger–Marsden experiments

The __{{Geiger–Marsden}} experiments__ (also known as the __{{Rutherford}} gold foil experiment__) were {{a series of experiments}} that led to {{the development of the [Rutherford model](Rutherford%20model.md)}} in {{1911}}. It was directed by {{[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md)}} in {{1909}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-18,472,290!2024-05-06,355,290!2026-10-05,1046,330!2024-04-09,347,290!2024-03-02,154,230!2025-02-02,588,310!2025-07-02,649,310-->

## experiment

A thin gold foil are {{bombarded by [alpha particles](alpha%20particle.md) in an evacuated chamber}}. The {{deflection angles}} are recorded. <!--SR:!2024-06-20,303,230!2024-11-07,520,310-->

### results

Most alpha particles pass through {{with minimal deflection}}. Few of them pass through {{with large deflection}}. Even fewer {{rebound back}}. <!--SR:!2027-05-23,1264,350!2024-09-18,428,290!2024-02-26,282,270-->

### implications

The results showed that the {{[plum pudding model](plum%20pudding%20model.md)}} was wrong. Most of the volume of an atom is {{empty}} as {{most alpha particles pass through with minimal deflection}}. Instead, {{the positive charge is concentrated in a tiny central region called the "nucleus"}}. {{Most mass is concentrated there}} as {{the nucleus is not deflected or moved by particles}}. Electrons, which {{does not affect}} the scattering, orbit around the nucleus. This is the {{[Rutherford model](Rutherford%20model.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-10,492,310!2023-12-07,277,330!2024-02-14,273,270!2023-12-13,209,230!2024-06-19,309,250!2025-01-24,490,250!2025-04-11,598,330!2027-01-17,1164,350-->
