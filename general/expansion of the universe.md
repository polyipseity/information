# expansion of the universe

The __expansion of the universe__ is {{the increase in [distance](proper%20length.md) between [gravitationally unbound](gravitational%20binding%20energy.md) parts of the [observable universe](observable%20universe.md) with time}}. It is {{an [intrinsic](intrinsic%20and%20extrinsic%20properties%20(philosophy).md) expansion}}, so {{it does not mean that the universe expands "into" anything or that space exists "outside" it}}. To {{any observer in the universe}}, it appears that {{all but [the nearest galaxies](Local%20Group.md) (which are bound to each other by gravity) recede at [speeds that are proportional to their distance from the observer](Hubble's%20law.md), on average}}. While {{objects cannot move [faster than light](faster-than-light.md)}}, this limitation {{applies only with respect to [local](principle%20of%20locality.md) [reference frames](frame%20of%20reference.md)}} and {{does not limit the recession rates of cosmologically distant objects}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-17,45,290!2024-10-25,51,310!2024-09-07,16,290!2024-09-06,15,290!2024-10-30,56,310!2024-09-06,15,290!2024-09-08,17,290!2024-11-02,58,310-->
