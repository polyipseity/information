# expansion of the universe

The __expansion of the universe__ is {{the increase in [distance](proper%20length.md) between [gravitationally unbound](gravitational%20binding%20energy.md) parts of the [observable universe](observable%20universe.md) with time}}. It is {{an [intrinsic](intrinsic%20and%20extrinsic%20properties%20(philosophy).md) expansion}}, so {{it does not mean that the universe expands "into" anything or that space exists "outside" it}}. To {{any observer in the universe}}, it appears that {{all but [the nearest galaxies](Local%20Group.md) (which are bound to each other by gravity) recede at [speeds that are proportional to their distance from the observer](Hubble's%20law.md), on average}}. While {{objects cannot move [faster than light](faster-than-light.md)}}, this limitation {{applies only with respect to [local](principle%20of%20locality.md) [reference frames](frame%20of%20reference.md)}} and {{does not limit the recession rates of cosmologically distant objects}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,133,290!2025-06-06,224,330!2025-08-26,287,330!2025-07-20,257,330!2025-04-28,180,310!2025-07-06,247,330!2025-05-11,197,310!2025-07-17,257,330-->
