# subgiant

## subgiant branch

### 0.4 M<sub>☉</sub> to 0.9 M<sub>☉</sub>

Stars with {{40 percent the mass of the Sun and larger}} have {{non-convective cores with a strong temperature gradient from the centre outwards}}. When they exhaust hydrogen at the core of the star, {{the shell of hydrogen surrounding the central core continues to fuse without interruption}}. The star is {{considered to be a subgiant at this point although there is little change visible from the exterior}}. As {{the fusing hydrogen shell converts its mass into helium}} the convective effect {{separates the helium towards the core where it very slowly increases the mass of the non-fusing core of nearly pure helium plasma}}. As this takes place {{the fusing hydrogen shell gradually expands outward}} which {{increases the size of the outer shell of the star up to the subgiant size from 2 to 10 times the original radius of the star when it was on the main sequence}}. The expansion of the outer layers of the star into the subgiant size {{nearly balances the increase energy generated by the hydrogen shell fusion causing the star to nearly maintain its surface temperature}}. This causes {{the spectral class of the star to change very little in the lower end of this range of star mass}}. The subgiant surface area radiating the energy is so much larger {{the potential [circumstellar habitable zone](habitable%20zone.md) where planetary orbits will be in the range to form liquid water is shifted much further out into any planetary system}}. The surface area of a sphere is {{found as 4πr<sup>2</sup>}} so a sphere with a radius of 2 R<sub>☉</sub> will release {{4 times as much energy at the surface}} and a sphere with a 10 R<sub>☉</sub> will release {{100 times as much energy}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-11,52,296!2024-09-10,21,230!2024-09-14,31,276!2024-10-17,51,270!2024-09-29,42,296!2024-09-24,32,256!2024-10-24,53,256!2024-09-06,21,236!2024-10-27,57,276!2024-09-03,18,236!2024-09-18,33,276!2024-10-20,63,310!2024-10-28,69,310!2024-10-17,61,316-->

The helium core mass is {{below the [Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit](Schönberg–Chandrasekhar%20limit.md) and it remains in thermal equilibrium with the fusing hydrogen shell}}. Its mass {{continues to increase and the star very slowly expands as the hydrogen shell migrates outwards}}. Any increase in energy output from the shell goes into {{expanding the envelope of the star and the luminosity stays approximately constant}}. The subgiant branch for these stars is {{short (in the HR diagram, not in time), horizontal, and heavily populated, as visible in very old clusters}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-08,25,270!2024-10-09,50,296!2024-09-11,20,236!2024-10-19,49,256-->

After {{one to eight billion years}}, the helium core becomes {{too massive to support its own weight and becomes degenerate}}. Its {{temperature increases, the rate of fusion in the hydrogen shell increases}}, the outer layers become {{strongly convective}}, and the luminosity {{increases at approximately the same effective temperature}}. The star is now {{on the [red-giant branch](red-giant%20branch.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-24,41,296!2024-10-23,66,316!2024-09-11,28,276!2024-09-06,18,216!2024-10-07,42,256!2024-10-12,53,296-->

### 1<sub>☉</sub> to 8 M<sub>☉</sub>

Stars {{as massive and larger than the Sun}} have {{a convective core on the main sequence}}. They develop {{a more massive helium core, taking up a larger fraction of the star, before they exhaust the hydrogen in the entire convective region}}. Fusion in the star {{ceases entirely and the core begins to contract and increase in temperature}}. The entire star {{contracts and increases in temperature}}, with the radiated luminosity {{actually increasing despite the lack of fusion}}. (For stars close to 1 solar mass, {{only the core contracts, and the outer shell expands and cools instead, though the luminosity still increases}}.) This continues for {{several million years before the core becomes hot enough to ignite hydrogen in a shell}}, which {{reverses the temperature and luminosity increase (eventually; initially, luminosity increases slightly) and the star starts to expand and cool}}. (For stars close to 1 solar mass, {{the above still happens, but the hook in the HR diagram does not appear}}.) This _hook_ (in the HR diagram) is {{generally defined as the end of the main sequence and the start of the subgiant branch in these stars}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-24,65,310!2024-09-15,31,270!2024-09-07,26,270!2024-10-21,64,316!2024-09-12,29,276!2024-09-12,32,276!2024-09-03,23,256!2024-09-09,28,276!2024-10-14,51,276!2024-10-22,53,270!2024-10-26,67,316-->

The core of stars below about 2 M<sub>☉</sub> is {{still below the [Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit](Schönberg–Chandrasekhar%20limit.md)}}, but {{hydrogen shell fusion quickly increases the mass of the core beyond that limit}}. More massive stars {{already have cores above the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar mass when they leave the main sequence}}. The exact initial mass at which stars will show a hook and at which they will leave the main sequence with cores above the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit depend on {{the metallicity and the degree of [overshooting](convective%20overshoot.md) in the convective core}}. Low metallicity {{causes the central part of even low mass cores to be convectively unstable}}, and overshooting causes {{the core to be larger when hydrogen becomes exhausted}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-19,62,310!2024-10-17,61,316!2024-10-11,55,310!2024-09-12,28,270!2024-09-26,40,296!2024-09-08,27,276-->

Once {{the core exceeds the C–R limit}}, it can {{no longer remain in thermal equilibrium with the hydrogen shell}}. It {{contracts and the outer layers of the star expand and cool}}. The energy to {{expand the outer envelope causes the radiated luminosity to decrease}}. When {{the outer layers cool sufficiently}}, they {{become opaque and force convection to begin outside the fusing shell}}. {{The expansion stops (for a while) and the radiated luminosity begins to increase}}, which is {{defined as the start of the red giant branch for these stars}}. Stars with {{an initial mass approximately 1–2 M<sub>☉</sub>}} can {{develop a degenerate helium core before this point}} and that will cause {{the star to enter the red giant branch earlier, like for lower mass stars}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-18,62,316!2024-10-24,66,316!2024-10-19,50,256!2024-09-17,28,256!2024-09-05,17,256!2024-10-20,55,276!2024-10-22,65,316!2024-10-06,48,296!2024-09-03,23,256!2024-09-13,30,276!2024-09-16,35,296-->

The core contraction and envelope expansion is {{very rapid, taking only a few million years}}. In this time {{the temperature of the star will cool from its main sequence value of 6&nbsp;000–30&nbsp;000 K to around 5&nbsp;000 K}}. Relatively few stars are {{seen in this stage of their evolution and there is an apparent lack in the H–R diagram known as the [Hertzsprung gap](hertzsprung%20gap.md)}}. It is most obvious in clusters {{from a few hundred million to a few billion years old}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-10,44,256!2024-09-05,20,236!2024-10-23,57,276!2024-11-15,74,276-->
