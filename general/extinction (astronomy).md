# extinction

In [astronomy](astronomy.md), __extinction__ is {@{the [absorption](absorption%20(electromagnetic%20radiation).md) and [scattering](scattering.md#electromagnetics) of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) by dust and gas between an emitting [astronomical object](astronomical%20object.md) and the [observer](observation.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-03,180,310-->

## interstellar reddening

Interstellar reddening is {@{a phenomenon associated with interstellar extinction where the [spectrum](astronomical%20spectroscopy.md) of electromagnetic radiation from a [radiation source](astronomical%20object.md) changes characteristics from that which the object originally [emitted](emission%20spectrum.md)}@}. Reddening occurs due to {@{the light scattering off [dust](cosmic%20dust.md) and other [matter](matter.md) in the [interstellar medium](interstellar%20medium.md)}@}. An example can be seen at {@{the edges of [dark nebulae](dark%20nebula.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-21,172,310!2025-03-25,176,310!2025-08-04,283,330-->
