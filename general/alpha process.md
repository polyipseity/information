# alpha process

The {{__alpha process__, also known as __alpha capture__ or the __alpha ladder__}}, is {{one of two classes of [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) reactions by which stars convert [helium](helium.md) into heavier [elements](chemical%20element.md)}}. The other class is {{a cycle of reactions called the [triple-alpha process](triple-alpha%20process.md), which consumes only helium, and produces [carbon](carbon.md)}}. The alpha process most commonly occurs in {{massive stars and during [supernovae](supernova.md)}}.
