# rigid frame

## description

In a rigid frame, structural elements like {{beams, columns, and floor slabs are rigidly connected}}. Typically, the material used is {{reinforced concrete}}. At {{junctions joining the structural elements}}, the joints are {{fixed and rigid}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-04,16,290!2024-06-01,13,270!2024-06-03,15,290!2024-06-05,17,290-->

Usually, the building plan is {{open and are rectangular grids, making space planning easy}}. Even {{the vertical plan (elevation)}} are {{rectangular grids}}. You can think of the structural elements as {{a 3D lattice}}, where the vertical structural elements are the {{columns or walls}} and others are the {{beams}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-29,10,270!2024-06-04,16,290!2024-06-03,15,290!2024-06-02,14,290!2024-06-03,15,290!2024-06-01,13,290-->

It is used in {{car parks, low-rise factories, etc.}} Economically, it makes sense {{up to about 25 stories}}, after which {{the lateral stiffness is too low, making it not suitable for tall buildings}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-04,16,290!2024-06-03,15,290!2024-06-01,13,270-->

It can be combined with {{[shear walls](shear%20wall.md), constrained to deflect together}}. This provides {{stiffer structure than rigid frame or shear walls alone}}. It is economic up to {{about 50 stories}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-29,10,270!2024-06-02,14,290!2024-05-30,11,270-->
