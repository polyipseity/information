# Chandrasekhar limit

The {{__Chandrasekhar limit__}} ({{/ˌtʃəndrəˈʃeɪkər/}}) is {{the maximum mass of a [stable](hydrostatic%20equilibrium.md) [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md) [star](star.md)}}. The currently accepted value of the Chandrasekhar limit is {{about 1.4 [M<sub>☉</sub>](solar%20mass.md) (2.765×10<sup>30</sup> kg)}}. The limit was named after {{[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar](Subrahmanyan%20Chandrasekhar.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-08,40,250!2024-10-20,49,250!2024-10-24,61,310!2024-10-12,42,250!2024-11-30,75,270-->

White dwarfs resist {{[gravitational collapse](gravitational%20collapse.md) primarily through [electron degeneracy pressure](electron%20degeneracy%20pressure.md), compared to [main sequence](main%20sequence.md) stars, which resist collapse through [thermal pressure](pressure.md#pressure%20of%20an%20ideal%20gas)}}. The Chandrasekhar limit is {{the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-09,114,290!2024-10-19,51,290-->
