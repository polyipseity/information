# Chandrasekhar limit

The {@{__Chandrasekhar limit__}@} ({@{/ˌtʃəndrəˈʃeɪkər/}@}) is {@{the maximum mass of a [stable](hydrostatic%20equilibrium.md) [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md) [star](star.md)}@}. The currently accepted value of the Chandrasekhar limit is {@{about 1.4 [M<sub>☉</sub>](solar%20mass.md) (2.765×10<sup>30</sup> kg)}@}. The limit was named after {@{[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar](Subrahmanyan%20Chandrasekhar.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-26,141,270!2025-04-16,178,270!2025-07-18,267,330!2025-01-29,106,250!2025-06-21,203,270-->

White dwarfs resist {@{[gravitational collapse](gravitational%20collapse.md) primarily through [electron degeneracy pressure](electron%20degeneracy%20pressure.md), compared to [main sequence](main%20sequence.md) stars, which resist collapse through [thermal pressure](pressure.md#pressure%20of%20an%20ideal%20gas)}@}. The Chandrasekhar limit is {@{the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-09,114,290!2025-05-13,206,310-->
