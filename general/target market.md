# target market

## importance

SOM can be treated as a {{short-term goal, which should be realized by a startup quickly for it to be viable}}. It is the most important for startups as {{failing to meet SOM renders SAM and TAM meaningless}}. If the company is good enough, SOM eventually {{approaches SAM}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-26,15,290!2024-05-27,16,290!2024-05-26,15,290-->
