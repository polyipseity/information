# gravitational wave

__Gravitational waves__ are {{waves of the intensity of [gravity](gravity.md)}} that are generated by {{the accelerated masses of [binary stars](binary%20star.md) and other motions of gravitating masses, and [propagate as waves](wave.md) outward from their source at the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md)}}.
