# conditional dependence

- see: [conditional independence](conditional%20independence.md)

For example, if $A$ and $B$ are {{two events that do not affect each other, and increases the probability of event $C$}}, then {{when $C$ is not observed}}: {{$$P(A \mid B) = P(A) \quad \text{ and } \quad P(B \mid A) = P(B)$$, i.e. $A$ and $B$ are [independent](independence%20(probability%20theory).md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-10,133,313!2025-01-25,166,313!2024-09-15,72,310-->

Now suppose {{$C$ is observed to occur}}. If {{event $B$ occurs, then the probability of event $A$ decreases because there is less need for event $A$ to explain event $C$ happening}}, and vice versa. So now, the two events $A$ and $B$ {{are negatively dependent on each other if the other occurs, given $C$}}: {{$$P(A \mid C \cap B) < P(A \mid C) \quad \text{ and } \quad P(B \mid C \cap A) < P(B \mid C)$$}}. This is called {{the conditional dependence of $A$ and $B$ given $C$}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-17,125,293!2024-11-14,103,290!2024-12-23,144,310!2024-08-26,50,270!2024-09-16,73,313-->

Conditional dependence of $A$ and $B$ given $C$ is the logical negation of {{[conditional independence](conditional%20independence.md) $(A \mathrel{\perp\!\!\!\perp} B \mid C)$}}, in which the two events {{do not affect the probability of each other given the occurrence of a third event}}: {{$$P(A \mid C \cap B) = P(A \mid C) \quad \text{ and } \quad P(B \mid C \cap A) = P(B \mid C)$$}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-31,59,310!2024-12-27,145,313!2024-12-13,134,313-->
