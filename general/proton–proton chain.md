# proton–proton chain

The __proton–proton chain__, also commonly referred to as the __p–p chain__, is {{one of two known sets of [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) reactions by which [stars](star.md) convert [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) to [helium](helium.md)}}. It dominates in {{[stars](star.md) with [masses](mass.md) less than or equal to that of the [Sun](Sun.md)}}, whereas the [CNO cycle](CNO%20cycle.md), the other known reaction, is suggested by theoretical models to {{dominate in [stars](star.md) with [masses](mass.md) greater than about 1.3 [solar masses](solar%20mass.md)}}.

## the proton–proton chain

The first step in all the branches is {{the fusion of two [protons](proton.md) ([hydrogen](hydrogen.md)) into a [deuteron](deuteron.md)}}. As the protons fuse, {{one of them undergoes [β+ decay](positron%20emission.md), converting into a [neutron](neutron.md) by emitting a [positron](positron.md) and an [electron neutrino](electron%20neutrino.md)}} (though a small amount of deuterium nuclei is produced by the [PEP reaction](#the%20PEP%20reaction)): {{$$\mathrm{p} + \mathrm{p} \to {}_1^2 \mathrm{D} + \mathrm{e}^+ + \nu_{\mathrm{e} } + 0.42  \text{ MeV}$$}} has a [_Q_ value](Q%20value%20(nuclear%20science).md) {{(released [energy](energy.md)) of 0.42&nbsp;[MeV](electronvolt.md)}}.

The [positron](positron.md) will {{[annihilate](annihilation.md) with an [electron](electron.md) from the environment into two [gamma rays](gamma%20ray.md). Including this annihilation and the energy of the neutrino}}, the net reaction {{$$\mathrm{p} + \mathrm{p} + \mathrm{e}^- \to {}_1^2 \mathrm{D} + \nu_{\mathrm{e} } + 2\, \gamma + 1.442\text{ MeV }$$}} (which is the same as the [PEP reaction](#the%20PEP%20reaction)) has a [_Q_ value](Q%20value%20(nuclear%20science).md) {{(released [energy](energy.md)) of 1.442&nbsp;[MeV](electronvolt.md)}}. The relative amounts of energy {{going to the neutrino and to the other products is variable}}.

After it is formed, the [deuteron](deuteron.md) produced in the first stage can {{fuse with another [proton](proton.md) to produce the stable, light [isotope](isotope.md) of [helium](helium.md), <sup>3</sup>He}}: {{$${}_1^2 \mathrm{D} + {}_1^1 \mathrm{H} \to {}_2^3 \mathrm{He} + \gamma + 5.493\text{ MeV}$$}} has a [_Q_ value](Q%20value%20(nuclear%20science).md) {{(released [energy](energy.md)) of 5.493&nbsp;[MeV](electronvolt.md)}}.

The overall reaction (ignoring uninvolved [electrons](electron.md)) is: {{$$4\, {}^1\mathrm{H}^+ + 2\,\mathrm{e}^- \to {}^4\mathrm{He}^{2+} + 2\,\nu_{\mathrm{e} } + n\, \gamma + 26.732\text{ MeV}$$}}, releasing {{26.732&nbsp;[MeV](electronvolt.md) of [energy](energy.md), some of which is lost to the neutrinos, and various number of [gamma rays](gamma%20ray.md) depending on the branch taken}}.

### the p–p I branch

{{$${}_2^3\mathrm{He} + {}_2^3\mathrm{He} \to {}_2^4\mathrm{He} + 2\, {}_1^1\mathrm{H} + 12.859\text{ MeV}$$}}, which has a [_Q_ value](Q%20value%20(nuclear%20science).md) {{(released [energy](energy.md)) of 12.859&nbsp;[MeV](electronvolt.md)}}. The complete chain releases {{a net energy of 26.732 MeV}} but {{2.2 percent of this energy (0.59&nbsp;MeV) is lost to the [neutrinos](neutrino.md) that are produced}}. The p–p I branch is dominant {{at [temperatures](temperature.md) of 10 to 18&nbsp;MK. Below 10&nbsp;MK}}, the p–p chain proceeds at slow rate, resulting in {{a low production of <sup>4</sup>He}}.
