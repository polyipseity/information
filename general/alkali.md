# alkali

An __alkali__ is {{defined as either a [basic](base%20(chemistry).md) [salt](salt%20(chemistry).md) of an [alkali metal](alkali%20metal.md) or [alkaline earth metals](alkaline%20earth%20metal.md), or a [base](base%20(chemistry).md) that is [soluble](solubility.md) in [water](water.md), the latter of which is also called an [Arrhenius base](base%20(chemistry).md#Arrhenius%20base)}}.

Common alkalis include {{[sodium hydroxide](sodium%20hydroxide.md) (NaOH), [potassium hydroxide](potassium%20hydroxide.md) (KOH), [calcium hydroxide](calcium%20hydroxide.md) (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and aqueous [ammonia](ammonia.md) (NH<sub>3</sub>)}}.
