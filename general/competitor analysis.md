## outline

This section {{outlines how one might do competitor analysis and present it to others}}.

### competitor classification

Depending on the 2 factors of {{meeting the same customer needs and possessing the same capabilities to do so (such as having a similar product to solve the same problem)}}, competitors can be classified into 4 types (we can {{draw a 2 by 2 table}} to represent it):

1. direct competitor ::: meeting the same customer needs and possessing the same capabilities to do so
2. indirect competitor ::: meeting the same customer needs but using different capabilities to do so
3. potential competitor ::: not meeting the same customer needs but possessing the same capabilities to do so
4. non-competitor ::: not meeting the same customer needs and not possessing the same capabilities to do so

Direct competitors are not {{necessarily more important than indirect or potential competitors, and instead it depends on the market}}.

> [!example] examples
>
> If I were [Starbucks](Starbucks.md), a [coffee shop](coffeehouse.md) company, then...
>
> - an direct competitor of Starbucks ::: [Dunkin' Donuts](Dunkin'%20Donuts.md): serves mainly coffee to satisfy beverage need
> - an indirect competitor of Starbucks ::: [bars](bar%20(establishment).md): does not serve coffee but [alcoholic beverages](alcoholic%20beverage.md) to satisfy beverage need
> - a potential competitor of Starbucks ::: [McDonald's](McDonald's.md): serves mainly coffee but usually as part of a meal to satisfy food need
> - a non-competitor of Starbucks ::: [Walmart](Walmart.md): does not serve coffee and does not satisfy beverage need

why: Why are people using competitors' products?

### when to do

Competitor analysis can be done {{anytime as needed}}. For example, it can expose holes in existing products during {{idea screening}}, or determine suitable prices during {{commercialization}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-10,4,270!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250-->

### comparison parameters

Common parameters used for comparison, {{most important first}}:

%%

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("9378", "a983"),
  """
price
benefit
quality
durability
service
convenience
ease of use
number of features
""".strip().splitlines(),
)
```

%%

<!--pytextgen generate section="9378"--><!-- The following content is generated at 2024-05-03T13:49:10.593096+08:00. Any edits will be overridden! -->

> 1. price
> 2. benefit
> 3. quality
> 4. durability
> 5. service
> 6. convenience
> 7. ease of use
> 8. number of features

<!--/pytextgen-->

<!--pytextgen generate section="a983"--><!-- The following content is generated at 2024-05-03T13:49:10.564767+08:00. Any edits will be overridden! -->

- _(begin)_→:::←price
- price→:::←benefit
- benefit→:::←quality <!--SR:!2024-05-10,3,254!2000-01-01,1,250-->
- quality→:::←durability
- durability→:::←service
- service→:::←convenience
- convenience→:::←ease of use
- ease of use→:::←number of features
- number of features→:::←_(end)_

<!--/pytextgen-->

### visualization

It is very important to {{add our own products to the visualization and make it obvious that product is our own}}.

If we are comparing two features only, we can {{use a _xy_-grid and plot our and competitors' products}}. If there are more features, {{we can use a table, with the column headers being the products and the row headers being the features}}. {{A mix of both}} is possible. <!--SR:!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2024-05-10,4,270-->

When listing the features, {{use numbers}} if possible. Do not be {{vague}}. Highlight {{important features, such as the best product for each feature}}.
