## outline

This section {{outlines how one might do competitor analysis and present it to others}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-31,16,294-->

### competitor classification

Depending on the 2 factors of {{meeting the same customer needs and possessing the same capabilities to do so (such as having a similar product to solve the same problem)}}, competitors can be classified into 4 types (we can {{draw a 2 by 2 table}} to represent it): <!--SR:!2024-06-01,15,301!2024-06-02,16,301-->

1. direct competitor ::: meeting the same customer needs and possessing the same capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2024-06-02,16,301!2024-06-01,15,301-->
2. indirect competitor ::: meeting the same customer needs but using different capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2024-05-27,11,281!2024-06-02,16,301-->
3. potential competitor ::: not meeting the same customer needs but possessing the same capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2024-05-25,9,261!2024-06-03,17,301-->
4. non-competitor ::: not meeting the same customer needs and not possessing the same capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2024-06-04,18,301!2024-06-02,16,301-->

Direct competitors are not {{necessarily more important than indirect or potential competitors, and instead it depends on the market}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-01,17,294-->

> [!example] examples
>
> If I were [Starbucks](Starbucks.md), a [coffee shop](coffeehouse.md) company, then...
>
> - an direct competitor of Starbucks ::: [Dunkin' Donuts](Dunkin'%20Donuts.md): serves mainly coffee to satisfy beverage need <!--SR:!2024-05-26,10,281!2024-06-02,16,301-->
> - an indirect competitor of Starbucks ::: [bars](bar%20(establishment).md): does not serve coffee but [alcoholic beverages](alcoholic%20beverage.md) to satisfy beverage need <!--SR:!2024-05-23,7,261!2024-05-31,14,301-->
> - a potential competitor of Starbucks ::: [McDonald's](McDonald's.md): serves mainly coffee but usually as part of a meal to satisfy food need <!--SR:!2024-06-03,17,301!2024-06-03,17,301-->
> - a non-competitor of Starbucks ::: [Walmart](Walmart.md): does not serve coffee and does not satisfy beverage need <!--SR:!2024-06-02,16,301!2024-06-03,17,301-->

### when to do

Competitor analysis can be done {{anytime as needed}}. For example, it can expose holes in existing products during {{idea screening}}, or determine suitable prices during {{commercialization}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-21,10,270!2024-06-04,18,301!2024-05-23,9,274-->

### comparison parameters

### visualization

It is very important to {{add our own products to the visualization and make it obvious that the products are our own}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-25,9,261-->

If we are comparing two features only, we can {{use a _xy_-grid and plot our and competitors' products}}. If there are more features, {{we can use a table, with the column headers being the products and the row headers being the features}}. {{A mix of both}} is possible. <!--SR:!2024-06-01,15,301!2024-05-29,14,294!2024-05-20,9,270-->

When listing the features, {{use numbers}} if possible. Do not be {{vague}}. Highlight {{important features, such as the best product for each feature}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-04,18,301!2024-06-03,17,301!2024-05-26,10,261-->
