## outline

This section {@{outlines how one might do competitor analysis and present it to others}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-11,281,334-->

### competitor classification

Depending on the 2 factors of {@{meeting the same customer needs and possessing the same capabilities to do so (such as having a similar product to solve the same problem)}@}, competitors can be classified into 4 types (we can {@{draw a 2 by 2 table}@} to represent it): <!--SR:!2025-06-07,299,341!2025-05-04,274,341-->

1. direct competitor ::@:: meeting the same customer needs and possessing the same capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2025-03-02,208,321!2025-06-12,304,341-->
2. indirect competitor ::@:: meeting the same customer needs but using different capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2025-06-01,249,281!2025-06-13,305,341-->
3. potential competitor ::@:: not meeting the same customer needs but possessing the same capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2026-04-09,526,321!2025-05-12,282,341-->
4. non-competitor ::@:: not meeting the same customer needs and not possessing the same capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2025-04-23,265,341!2025-06-11,303,341-->

Direct competitors are not {@{necessarily more important than indirect or potential competitors, and instead it depends on the market}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-09,213,314-->

> [!example] examples
>
> If I were [Starbucks](Starbucks.md), a [coffee shop](coffeehouse.md) company, then...
>
> - an direct competitor of Starbucks ::@:: [Dunkin' Donuts](Dunkin'%20Donuts.md): serves mainly coffee to satisfy beverage need <!--SR:!2024-12-08,158,321!2025-05-29,294,341-->
> - an indirect competitor of Starbucks ::@:: [bars](bar%20(establishment).md): does not serve coffee but [alcoholic beverages](alcoholic%20beverage.md) to satisfy beverage need <!--SR:!2025-02-04,176,281!2025-07-11,327,341-->
> - a potential competitor of Starbucks ::@:: [McDonald's](McDonald's.md): serves mainly coffee but usually as part of a meal to satisfy food need <!--SR:!2025-04-06,233,321!2025-08-07,349,341-->
> - a non-competitor of Starbucks ::@:: [Walmart](Walmart.md): does not serve coffee and does not satisfy beverage need <!--SR:!2025-07-06,323,341!2025-05-14,282,341-->

### when to do

Competitor analysis can be done {@{anytime as needed}@}. For example, it can expose holes in existing products during {@{idea screening}@}, or determine suitable prices during {@{commercialization}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-15,166,310!2025-04-06,252,341!2025-06-10,269,294-->

<!--/pytextgen-->

### visualization

It is very important to {@{add our own products to the visualization and make it obvious that the products are our own}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-20,510,321-->

If we are comparing two features only, we can {@{use a _xy_-grid and plot our and competitors' products}@}. If there are more features, {@{we can use a table, with the row headers being the features and the column headers being the products}@}. {@{A mix of both}@} is possible. <!--SR:!2025-06-01,293,341!2025-03-26,242,334!2024-11-26,152,310-->

When listing the features, {@{use numbers}@} if possible. Do not be {@{vague}@}. Highlight {@{important features, such as the best product for each feature}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-24,212,321!2025-05-09,278,341!2024-12-08,157,301-->
