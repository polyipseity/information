```

## outline

This section {{outlines how one might do competitor analysis and present it to others}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-03,64,314-->

### competitor classification

Depending on the 2 factors of {{meeting the same customer needs and possessing the same capabilities to do so (such as having a similar product to solve the same problem)}}, competitors can be classified into 4 types (we can {{draw a 2 by 2 table}} to represent it): <!--SR:!2024-08-11,68,321!2024-08-02,62,321-->

1. direct competitor ::: meeting the same customer needs and possessing the same capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2024-08-06,65,321!2024-08-11,69,321-->
2. indirect competitor ::: meeting the same customer needs but using different capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2024-06-28,32,281!2024-08-12,69,321-->
3. potential competitor ::: not meeting the same customer needs but possessing the same capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2024-06-26,32,281!2024-08-03,62,321-->
4. non-competitor ::: not meeting the same customer needs and not possessing the same capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2024-07-31,60,321!2024-08-11,69,321-->

Direct competitors are not {{necessarily more important than indirect or potential competitors, and instead it depends on the market}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-08,68,314-->

> [!example] examples
>
> If I were [Starbucks](Starbucks.md), a [coffee shop](coffeehouse.md) company, then...
>
> - an direct competitor of Starbucks ::: [Dunkin' Donuts](Dunkin'%20Donuts.md): serves mainly coffee to satisfy beverage need <!--SR:!2024-07-03,38,301!2024-08-07,66,321-->
> - an indirect competitor of Starbucks ::: [bars](bar%20(establishment).md): does not serve coffee but [alcoholic beverages](alcoholic%20beverage.md) to satisfy beverage need <!--SR:!2024-08-11,63,281!2024-08-18,74,321-->
> - a potential competitor of Starbucks ::: [McDonald's](McDonald's.md): serves mainly coffee but usually as part of a meal to satisfy food need <!--SR:!2024-08-16,73,321!2024-08-23,79,321-->
> - a non-competitor of Starbucks ::: [Walmart](Walmart.md): does not serve coffee and does not satisfy beverage need <!--SR:!2024-08-17,73,321!2024-08-05,64,321-->

### when to do

Competitor analysis can be done {{anytime as needed}}. For example, it can expose holes in existing products during {{idea screening}}, or determine suitable prices during {{commercialization}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-01,41,290!2024-07-28,57,321!2024-06-15,23,274-->

### comparison parameters

Common parameters used for comparison, {{most important first}}: <!--SR:!2024-07-14,45,294-->

### visualization

It is very important to {{add our own products to the visualization and make it obvious that the products are our own}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-26,32,281-->

If we are comparing two features only, we can {{use a _xy_-grid and plot our and competitors' products}}. If there are more features, {{we can use a table, with the column headers being the products and the row headers being the features}}. {{A mix of both}} is possible. <!--SR:!2024-08-10,67,321!2024-07-24,56,314!2024-06-27,38,290-->

When listing the features, {{use numbers}} if possible. Do not be {{vague}}. Highlight {{important features, such as the best product for each feature}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-26,51,301!2024-08-04,63,321!2024-07-04,39,281-->
