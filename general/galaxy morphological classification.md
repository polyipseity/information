# galaxy morphological classification

__Galaxy morphological classification__ is {{a system used by [astronomers](astronomer.md) to divide [galaxies](galaxy.md) into groups based on their visual appearance}}. There are {{several schemes in use by which galaxies can be classified according to their morphologies}}, the most famous being {{the [Hubble sequence](hubble%20sequence.md), devised by [Edwin Hubble](Edwin%20Hubble.md)}} and later {{expanded by [Gérard de Vaucouleurs](Gérard%20de%20Vaucouleurs.md) and [Allan Sandage](Allan%20Sandage.md)}}. However, galaxy classification and morphology are now {{largely done using computational methods and physical morphology}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-23,148,310!2025-05-11,206,310!2025-04-19,191,310!2025-05-19,187,270!2025-03-09,159,310-->
