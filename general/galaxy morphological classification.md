# galaxy morphological classification

__Galaxy morphological classification__ is {@{a system used by [astronomers](astronomer.md) to divide [galaxies](galaxy.md) into groups based on their visual appearance}@}. There are {@{several schemes in use by which galaxies can be classified according to their morphologies}@}, the most famous being {@{the [Hubble sequence](hubble%20sequence.md), devised by [Edwin Hubble](Edwin%20Hubble.md)}@} and later {@{expanded by [Gérard de Vaucouleurs](Gérard%20de%20Vaucouleurs.md) and [Allan Sandage](Allan%20Sandage.md)}@}. However, galaxy classification and morphology are now {@{largely done using computational methods and physical morphology}@}.
