# _k_-nearest neighbors algorithm

## algorithm

The training samples are {{[feature vectors](feature%20(machine%20learning).md#feature%20vectors) representing in a multidimensional space, each with a class label}}. The training phase {{consists only of storing the vectors and class labels}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-17,3,250!2024-06-17,3,250-->

In the classification phase, {{_k_ is a user-defined [hyperparameter](hyperparameter%20(machine%20learning).md)}}. An unlabeled sample, represented as {{a feature vector, is classified by assigning the label to which is the most frequent among the _k_ nearest training samples}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-17,3,250!2024-06-17,3,250-->
