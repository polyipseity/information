# statistical inference

__Statistical inference__ is {@{the process of using [data analysis](data%20analysis.md) to infer properties of an underlying [distribution of probability](probability%20distribution.md)}@}. __Inferential statistical analysis__ infers {@{properties of a [population](statistical%20population.md)}@}, for example by {@{__testing hypotheses__ and deriving estimates}@}. It is assumed that {@{the observed data set is [sampled](sampling%20(statistics).md) from a larger population}@}.

__Inferential statistics__ can be contrasted with {@{[descriptive statistics](descriptive%20statistics.md)}@}. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with {@{properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population}@}. In [machine learning](machine%20learning.md), the term _inference_ is {@{sometimes used instead to mean "make a prediction, by evaluating an already trained model"}@}; in this context {@{inferring properties of the model}@} is referred to as {@{_training_ or _learning_ (rather than _inference_)}@}, and {@{using a model for prediction}@} is referred to as {@{_inference_ (instead of _prediction_)}@}; see also [predictive inference](statistical%20inference.md#prediction).
