# tidal force

The __tidal force__ or __tide-generating force__ is {{a [gravitational](gravity.md) effect that stretches a [body](physical%20object.md) along the line towards and away from the [center of mass](center%20of%20mass.md) of another body due to spatial variations in strength in [gravitational field](gravitational%20field.md) from the other body}}.

## explanation

When a body (body 1) is {{acted on by the [gravity](gravity.md) of another body (body 2)}}, the [gravitational field](gravitational%20field.md) can {{vary significantly on body 1 between the side of the body facing body 2 and the side facing away from body 2}}. By {{subtracting the gravitational acceleration of the [center of mass](center%20of%20mass.md) of body 1 from the gravitational acceleration of every point of body 1}}, {{a stretching effect along the line joining the center of mass of body 2}} can be seen. These are the _tidal forces_.
