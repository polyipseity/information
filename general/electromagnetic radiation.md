# electromagnetic radiation

__Electromagnetic radiation__ (__EMR__) consists of {{[waves](wave.md) of the [electromagnetic field](electromagnetic%20field.md)}}.  It {{propagates through [space](space.md) and carry [momentum](momentum.md) and electromagnetic [radiant energy](radiant%20energy.md)}}. In {{[quantum mechanics](quantum%20mechanics.md)}}, EMR is viewed as {{consisting of [photons](photon.md) (also see [wave–particle duality](wave–particle%20duality.md))}}. <!--SR:!2025-05-25,624,270!2024-08-14,18,306!2024-08-14,18,306!2024-08-14,18,306-->

## properties

### wave model

{{The [electric field](electric%20field.md) and the [magnetic field](magnetic%20field.md)}} in the electromagnetic radiation {{oscillates perpendicularly in sync}}. <!--SR:!2025-05-29,628,270!2025-06-26,642,270-->

{{[Electric charges](electric%20charge.md) have an [oscillating](oscillation.md) [force](force.md) applied}} by the electric field in the radiation. <!--SR:!2025-06-20,436,210-->

> - [electric charges](electric%20charge.md) [oscillate](oscillation.md) due to electromagnetic radiation: It is important to recognize that the oscillation {{refers to the [force](force.md) but not the [position](position%20(geometry).md) of the [electric charge](electric%20charge.md)}}. That is, the electric charge {{does not necessarily oscillate in place}}. If one starts a [thought experiment](thought%20experiment.md), initially with {{a free [electron](electron.md) at rest and a beam of electromagnetic radiation passes through it no matter where it goes}}. One would find the free electron {{oscillate up and down about a constantly drifting point by setting the initial phase of the electromagnetic radiation such that it applies zero [electrostatic force](Coulomb's%20law.md) initially}}. It is also possible to make the free electron {{oscillate up and down about a fixed point by setting the initial phase of the electromagnetic radiation such that it applies maximum electrostatic force initially}}. This apparent paradox can be resolved by realizing {{there are no free electrons in practice, bounded by either [atoms](atom.md), [molecules](molecule.md), or external [electromagnetic fields](electromagnetic%20field.md), thus prohibiting [translatory motion](translation%20(geometry).md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-29,216,315!2024-10-17,185,315!2024-11-14,192,275!2025-07-17,343,275!2024-09-22,167,315!2025-02-24,236,255-->

## interactions

### photoelectric effect

{{Electromagnetic radiation striking a material causes [electrons](electron.md) to be emitted.}} This is known as the {{[photoelectric effect](photoelectric%20effect.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-27,429,230!2025-02-11,590,310-->
