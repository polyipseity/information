# electromagnetic radiation

__Electromagnetic radiation__ (__EMR__) is {{a wave of the [electromagnetic field](electromagnetic%20field.md)}}.

## properties

### wave model

{{The [electric field](electric%20field.md) and the [magnetic field](magnetic%20field.md)}} in the electromagnetic radiation {{oscillates perpendicularly in sync}}.

{{[Electric charges](electric%20charge.md) are vibrated}} by the electric field in the radiation.

## interactions

### photoelectric effect

{{Electromagnetic radiation striking a material causes [electrons](electron.md) to be emitted.}} This is known as the {{[photoelectric effect](photoelectric%20effect.md)}}.
