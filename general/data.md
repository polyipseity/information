# data

In common [usage](usage%20(language).md), __data__ (/ˈdeɪtə/, also [US](American%20English.md): /ˈdætə/) is {{a collection of discrete or continuous [values](value%20(semiotics).md) that convey [information](information.md)}}, describing {{the [quantity](quantity.md), [quality](qualitative%20property.md), [fact](fact.md), [statistics](statistics.md), other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of [symbols](symbol.md) that may be further [interpreted formally](interpretation%20(logic).md)}}. A __datum__ is {{an individual value in a collection of data}}. Data are usually {{organized into [structures](structure.md) such as [tables](table%20(information).md) that provide additional context and meaning}}, and may themselves be {{used as data in larger structures}}. Data may be [used](data%20(computer%20science).md) as {{[variables](variable%20and%20attribute%20(research).md)}} in a [computational process](computation.md). Data may represent {{abstract ideas or concrete measurements}}. Data are commonly used in {{[scientific research](scientific%20method.md), [economics](economics.md), and virtually every other form of human organizational activity}}. Examples of data sets include {{price indices (such as the [consumer price index](consumer%20price%20index.md)), [unemployment rates](unemployment.md#measurement), [literacy](literacy.md) rates, and [census](census.md) data}}. In this context, data represent {{the raw facts and figures from which useful information can be extracted}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-04,46,290!2025-01-10,85,270!2025-05-08,186,310!2024-11-08,52,310!2024-11-29,68,310!2025-04-29,180,310!2024-11-09,53,310!2024-11-13,52,290!2025-02-09,117,290!2025-04-25,173,310-->
