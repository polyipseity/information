# zero force member

In [engineering mechanics](applied%20mechanics.md), a __zero force member__ is {{a member in a [truss](truss.md) which, given a specific [load](structural%20load.md), is neither in [tension](tension%20(physics).md) nor in [compression](compression%20(physics).md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-05-08,273,330-->

## description

Zero force members are found {{at joints where three or fewer truss members meet}}. Also, the joints {{either have no external forces, or the external forces act in a manner similar to the members as described below}}. Specifically, there are {{2}} situations: <!--SR:!2025-05-30,289,330!2025-04-11,251,330!2025-08-28,351,352-->

- 2 truss members ::: If they are non-collinear and meet in an unloaded (or the load, when treated as a truss member, acts in a similar manner) joint, they are both zero force members. <!--SR:!2025-01-10,166,310!2025-02-20,182,290-->
- 3 truss members ::: If they meet in an unloaded (or the load, when treated as a truss member, acts in a similar manner) joint and two of them are collinear, then the non-collinear member is a zero force member. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,217,330!2024-10-16,103,290-->

The above can be proved {{using [vectors](vector%20(mathematics%20and%20physics).md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-09-14,365,352-->
