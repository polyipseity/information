# zero force member

In [engineering mechanics](applied%20mechanics.md), a __zero force member__ is {{a member in a [truss](truss.md) which, given a specific [load](structural%20load.md), is neither in [tension](tension%20(physics).md) nor in [compression](compression%20(physics).md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-07,63,310-->

## description

Zero force members are found {{at joints where three or fewer truss members meet}}. Also, the joints {{either have no external forces, or the external forces act in a manner similar to the members as described below}}. Specifically, there are {{2}} situations: <!--SR:!2024-06-06,17,290!2024-08-02,59,310!2024-06-08,4,292-->

- 2 truss members ::: If they are non-collinear and meet in an unloaded joint, they are both zero force members. <!--SR:!2024-07-28,55,310!2024-06-20,17,270-->
- 3 truss members ::: If they meet in an unloaded joint and two of them are collinear, then the non-collinear member is a zero force member. <!--SR:!2024-07-23,51,310!2024-07-05,36,290-->

The above can be proved {{using [vectors](vector%20(mathematics%20and%20physics).md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-08,4,292-->
