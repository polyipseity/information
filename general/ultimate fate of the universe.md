# ultimate fate of the universe

The __ultimate fate of the universe__ is {{a topic in [physical cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md)}}, whose {{theoretical restrictions allow possible scenarios for the [evolution](chronology%20of%20the%20universe.md) and ultimate fate of the [universe](universe.md) to be described and evaluated}}. Based on {{available observational evidence}}, deciding the fate and evolution of the universe has {{become a valid cosmological question, being beyond the mostly [untestable](falsifiability.md) constraints of [mythological or theological beliefs](eschatology.md)}}. {{Several possible futures}} have been predicted by {{different scientific hypotheses}}, including that {{the universe might have existed for a finite and [infinite duration](static%20universe.md), or towards explaining the manner and circumstances of its beginning}}.
