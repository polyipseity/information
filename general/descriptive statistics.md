# descriptive statistics

A __descriptive statistic__ (in the [count noun](count%20noun.md) sense) is {{a [summary statistic](summary%20statistics.md) that quantitatively describes or summarizes features from a collection of [information](information.md)}}, while __descriptive statistics__ (in the [mass noun](mass%20noun.md) sense) is {{the process of using and analysing those statistics}}. Descriptive statistics is distinguished from {{[inferential statistics](statistical%20inference.md) (or inductive statistics) by its aim to summarize a [sample](sampling%20(statistics).md), rather than use the data to learn about the [population](statistical%20population.md) that the sample of data is thought to represent}}. This generally means that descriptive statistics, {{unlike inferential statistics, is not developed on the basis of [probability theory](probability%20theory.md), and are frequently [nonparametric statistics](nonparametric%20statistics.md)}}. Even when a data analysis {{draws its main conclusions using inferential statistics}}, {{descriptive statistics are generally also presented}}. For example, in papers reporting on human subjects, typically {{a table is included giving the overall [sample size](sample%20size%20determination.md), sample sizes in important subgroups (e.g., for each treatment or exposure group)}}, and {{[demographic](demography.md) or clinical characteristics such as the [average](average.md) age, the proportion of subjects of each sex, the proportion of subjects with related [co-morbidities](comorbidity.md), etc.}} <!--SR:!2024-11-13,52,290!2024-11-16,58,310!2024-12-03,72,310!2024-10-10,26,270!2025-01-02,86,290!2024-11-09,53,310!2024-10-13,29,270!2024-10-24,37,290-->

Some measures that are commonly used to describe a data set are {{measures of [central tendency](central%20tendency.md) and measures of variability or [dispersion](statistical%20dispersion.md)}}. Measures of central tendency include {{the [mean](mean.md), [median](median.md) and [mode](mode%20(statistics).md)}}, while measures of variability include {{the [standard deviation](standard%20deviation.md) (or [variance](variance.md)), the minimum and maximum values of the variables, [kurtosis](kurtosis.md) and [skewness](skewness.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-11,54,310!2024-11-12,55,310!2024-11-08,47,290-->
