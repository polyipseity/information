# Henyey track

The __Henyey track__ is {{a path taken by [pre-main-sequence stars](pre-main-sequence%20star.md) with masses greater than 0.5 [solar masses](solar%20mass.md) in the [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md) after the end of the [Hayashi track](Hayashi%20track.md)}}. {{The astronomer [Louis G. Henyey](Louis%20G.%20Henyey.md) and his colleagues in the 1950s}} showed that {{the pre-main-sequence star can remain in [radiative equilibrium](radiative%20equilibrium.md) throughout some period of its contraction to the main sequence}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-01,20,250!2024-08-26,17,250!2024-09-05,24,270-->

The Henyey track is characterized by {{a slow collapse in near [hydrostatic equilibrium](hydrostatic%20equilibrium.md)}}, approaching the main sequence {{almost horizontally in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (i.e. the [luminosity](luminosity.md) remains almost constant)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-12,31,290!2024-08-25,16,250-->
