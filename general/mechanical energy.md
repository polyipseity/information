# mechanical energy

## conservation of mechanical energy

### satellite

- see: [vis-viva equation](vis-viva%20equation.md)

A satellite in orbit conserves {{its mechanical energy, which is the sum of its [kinetic energy](kinetic%20energy.md) and its [gravitational potential energy](gravitational%20energy.md)}}. This explains the closer the satellite is to Earth, {{the higher its [velocity](velocity.md), and vice versa}}. <!--SR:!2025-05-17,226,330!2024-10-05,55,310-->
