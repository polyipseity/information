# Kepler orbit

In [celestial mechanics](celestial%20mechanics.md), a __Kepler orbit__ (or __Keplerian orbit__, named after {{the German astronomer [Johannes Kepler](Johannes%20Kepler.md)}}) is {{the motion of one body relative to another, as an [ellipse](ellipse.md), [parabola](parabola.md), or [hyperbola](hyperbola.md), which forms a two-dimensional orbital plane in three-dimensional space. A Kepler orbit can also form a [straight line](line%20(geometry).md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,4,270!2024-07-19,4,270-->
