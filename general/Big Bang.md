# Big Bang

The __Big Bang__ is {{a [physical theory](theoretical%20physics.md) that describes how the [universe expanded](expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md) from an initial state of high [density](energy%20density.md) and [temperature](temperature.md)}}. It was {{first proposed as a [physical theory](theoretical%20physics.md) in 1931}} by {{[Roman Catholic priest](priesthood%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church.md) and [physicist](physicist.md) [Georges Lemaître](Georges%20Lemaître.md)}} when {{he suggested the universe emerged from a "primeval atom"}}. Various [cosmological models](physical%20cosmology.md) of the Big Bang explain {{the evolution of the [observable universe](observable%20universe.md) from the [earliest known periods](planck%20units.md#cosmology) through its subsequent large-scale form}}. These models offer {{a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena}}, including {{the abundance of [light elements](chemical%20element.md), the [cosmic microwave background](cosmic%20microwave%20background.md) (CMB) [radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md), and [large-scale structure](observable%20universe.md#large-scale%20structure)}}. {{The uniformity of the universe, known as the [flatness problem](flatness%20problem.md)}}, is explained {{through [cosmic inflation](cosmic%20inflation.md): a sudden and very rapid expansion of space during the earliest moments}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-04,13,290!2024-09-03,12,270!2024-09-26,28,270!2024-09-07,16,290!2024-09-02,11,270!2024-09-06,15,290!2024-09-17,19,250!2024-09-08,17,290!2024-09-07,16,290-->

## observational evidence

The earliest and most direct observational evidence of the validity of the theory are the expansion of the universe according to Hubble's law (as indicated by the redshifts of galaxies), discovery and measurement of the cosmic microwave background and the relative abundances of light elements produced by [Big Bang nucleosynthesis](Big%20Bang%20nucleosynthesis.md) (BBN). More recent evidence includes observations of [galaxy formation and evolution](galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md), and the distribution of [large-scale cosmic structures](observable%20universe.md#large-scale%20structure), These are sometimes called the "four pillars" of the Big Bang models.

### Hubble's law and the expansion of the universe

### cosmic microwave background radiation

- see: [cosmic microwave background](cosmic%20microwave%20background.md)

In {{1964}}, {{[Arno Penzias](Arno%20Allan%20Penzias.md) and [Robert Wilson](Robert%20Woodrow%20Wilson.md)}} {{serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the [microwave](microwave.md) band}}. Their discovery {{provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions}} by {{Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950}}. Through {{the 1970s}}, the radiation was {{found to be approximately consistent with a [blackbody](black%20body.md) spectrum in all directions}}; this spectrum has been {{redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725 K}}. This {{tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model}}, and Penzias and Wilson were {{awarded the 1978 [Nobel Prize in Physics](Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-28,30,270!2024-09-19,21,250!2024-09-22,24,270!2024-09-05,14,290!2024-09-03,10,230!2024-09-12,14,250!2024-09-07,16,290!2024-10-13,43,290!2024-09-08,17,290!2024-09-17,19,250-->

{{The _surface of last scattering_}} corresponding to {{emission of the CMB occurs shortly after _[recombination](recombination%20(cosmology).md)_, the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable}}. Prior to this, {{the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly [scattered](thomson%20scattering.md) from free charged particles}}. Peaking at {{around 372±14 kyr}}, the mean free path for a photon {{becomes long enough to reach the present day and the universe becomes transparent}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-04,13,290!2024-09-02,13,270!2024-09-14,16,250!2024-09-26,27,250!2024-09-04,13,290-->

### abundance of primordial elements

- see: [Big Bang nucleosynthesis](Big%20Bang%20nucleosynthesis.md)

Using Big Bang models, it is possible to {{calculate the expected concentration of the isotopes [helium-4](helium-4.md) (<sup>4</sup>He), [helium-3](helium-3.md) (<sup>3</sup>He), deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H), and [lithium-7](isotopes%20of%20lithium.md#lithium-7) (<sup>7</sup>Li) in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen}}. The relative abundances depend on {{a single parameter, the ratio of photons to baryons}}. This value can be calculated {{independently from the detailed structure of CMB fluctuations}}. The ratios predicted (by {{mass, not by abundance}}) are {{about 0.25 for <sup>4</sup>He:H}}, {{about 10<sup>−3</sup> for <sup>2</sup>H:H}}, {{about 10<sup>−4</sup> for <sup>3</sup>He:H}}, and {{about 10<sup>−9</sup> for <sup>7</sup>Li:H}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-06,15,290!2024-09-08,17,290!2024-09-05,14,290!2024-09-08,17,290!2024-09-05,14,290!2024-09-11,16,250!2024-09-24,25,250!2024-09-15,17,250-->
