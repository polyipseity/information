# Rutherford model

The __{{Rutherford}} model__ is {{a historical scientific model of the [atom](atom.md)}}. The model has {{[electrons](electron.md) orbiting around a tiny and heavy central positive charge called the "[nucleus](nucleus.md)"}}. It was first proposed by {{[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md)}} in {{1911}}. <!--SR:!2027-07-15,1305,350!2026-01-20,877,335!2024-06-10,254,215!2026-12-19,1096,315!2024-07-10,379,270-->

## problems

Orbiting electrons {{undergo acceleration}}, so {{[electromagnetic waves](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) should be emitted}}. The electrons {{lose energy}}, {{spiralling inwards and collapsing into the nucleus}}. This is problematic as {{the model implies all atoms are unstable}}. Also, as the electrons spiral inwards, {{the frequency of emission increases}} as {{the orbital period becomes shorter}}, so {{a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiation should be emitted}}. However, it is observed that {{radiation are emitted at discrete frequencies}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-01,362,290!2024-01-09,256,270!2026-07-20,1018,330!2026-02-07,813,290!2024-04-19,313,290!2025-08-24,629,255!2024-01-04,246,270!2024-01-31,270,275!2024-12-02,452,255-->
