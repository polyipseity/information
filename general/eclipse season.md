# eclipse season

An __eclipse season__ is {{a period, roughly every six months, when [eclipses](eclipse.md) occur}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-26,39,290-->

{{Only two (or occasionally three) eclipse seasons}} occur during each year, and each season lasts {{about 35 days and repeats just short of six months (173 days) later}}, thus {{two _full_ eclipse seasons always occur each year}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-25,37,290!2024-07-21,13,270!2024-07-22,13,270-->
