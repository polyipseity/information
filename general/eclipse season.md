# eclipse season

An __eclipse season__ is {@{a period, roughly every six months, when [eclipses](eclipse.md) occur}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-16,112,290-->

{@{Only two (or occasionally three) eclipse seasons}@} occur during each year, and each season lasts {@{about 35 days and repeats just short of six months (173 days) later}@}, thus {@{two _full_ eclipse seasons always occur each year}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-10,106,290!2025-08-15,258,270!2025-03-14,188,310-->
