# Galileo's ship

## 1632 thought experiment

To prove the point [Galileo](Galileo%20Galilei.md)'s {{fictional advocate Salviati}} proposed the experiment described below to {{show the classical [principle of relativity](principle%20of%20relativity.md)}} according to which there is {{no internal observation (i.e. without, as it were, looking out the window) by which one can distinguish between a system moving uniformly from one at rest}}. Hence, {{any two systems moving without [acceleration](acceleration.md)}} are equivalent, and {{unaccelerated motion}} is relative. <!--SR:!2024-09-27,55,310!2024-09-23,53,310!2024-08-22,24,270!2024-10-04,61,310!2024-10-02,60,310-->
