# protostar

A __protostar__ is {{a very young [star](star.md) that is still gathering mass from its parent [molecular cloud](molecular%20cloud.md)}}. It is {{the earliest phase}} in the process of [stellar evolution](stellar%20evolution.md). For {{a low-mass star (i.e. that of the [Sun](sun.md) or lower)}}, it lasts {{about 500&nbsp;000 years}}. The phase begins when {{a molecular cloud fragment first collapses under the force of self-[gravity](gravity.md) and an opaque, pressure-supported core forms inside the collapsing fragment}}. It ends when {{the infalling gas is depleted, leaving a [pre-main-sequence star](pre-main-sequence%20star.md)}}, which {{contracts to later become a [main-sequence star](main%20sequence.md) at the onset of [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) [fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) producing [helium](helium.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-02,3,250!2024-08-02,3,250!2024-07-31,1,230!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-03,4,270-->
