# current ratio

The __current ratio__ is {@{an liquidity ratio that measures whether a firm has enough resources to meet its short-term obligations}@}. It is {@{the ratio of a firm's [current assets](current%20asset.md) to its [current liabilities](current%20liability.md), $\frac{\text{⁠Current Assets} } {\text{Current Liabilities} }$}@}⁠. <!--SR:!2025-07-20,232,330!2024-12-15,66,310-->

The current ratio is an indication of {@{a firm's [accounting liquidity](accounting%20liquidity.md)}@}. Acceptable current ratios {@{vary across industries}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> Generally, high current ratio are regarded as {@{better than low current ratios, as an indication of whether a company can pay a [creditor](creditor.md) back}@}. However, if {@{a company's current ratio is too high}@}, it may {@{indicate that the company is not efficiently using its current assets}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-01,54,310!2024-12-02,55,310!2025-04-25,164,310!2024-12-06,59,310!2024-12-09,62,310-->

{@{A current ratio of less than 1}@} indicates that {@{the company may have problems meeting its short-term obligations}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> However, if {@{inventory turns into cash much more rapidly than the accounts payable become due}@}, then {@{the firm's current ratio can comfortably remain less than one}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> Low current ratios can also be {@{justified for businesses that can collect cash from customers long before they need to pay their suppliers}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-06,59,310!2024-12-13,66,310!2025-05-07,169,310!2024-12-03,56,310!2024-12-05,58,310-->

To {@{determine liquidity}@}, {@{the [quick ratio](quick%20ratio.md)}@} is also used, which {@{excludes current assets that may not be easily liquidated, like prepaid expenses and inventory}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-14,65,310!2024-12-01,54,310!2024-12-10,63,310-->
