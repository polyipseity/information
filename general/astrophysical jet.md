# astrophysical jet

An __astrophysical jet__ is {{an [astronomical](astronomy.md) phenomenon where outflows of [ionised](ionization.md) matter are emitted as extended beams along the [axis of rotation](rotation.md)}}. When {{this greatly accelerated matter in the beam approaches the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md)}}, astrophysical jets become {{__relativistic jets__ as they show effects from [special relativity](special%20relativity.md)}}.
