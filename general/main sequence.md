# main sequence

The more [massive](mass.md) a [star](star.md) is, {{the shorter its lifespan on the main sequence}}. After {{the [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) fuel at the core has been consumed}}, the star {{[evolves](stellar%20evolution.md) away from the main sequence on the [HR diagram](Hertzsprungâ€“Russell%20diagram.md), into a [supergiant](supergiant.md), [red giant](red%20giant.md), or directly to a [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md)}}. Hypothetically, {{[red dwarfs](red%20dwarf.md) directly turn into [blue dwarfs](blue%20dwarf%20(red-dwarf%20stage).md) after using up most of its [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) (and then later, [white dwarf](whit%20dwarf.md))}}, but this has {{yet to taken place due to predicted lifespans of red dwarfs being in the trillions}}.
