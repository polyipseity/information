# main sequence

The more [massive](mass.md) a [star](star.md) is, {{the shorter its lifespan on the main sequence}}. After {{the [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) fuel at the core has been consumed}}, the star {{[evolves](stellar%20evolution.md) away from the main sequence on the [HR diagram](Hertzsprungâ€“Russell%20diagram.md), into a [supergiant](supergiant.md), [red giant](red%20giant.md), or directly to a [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md)}}. Hypothetically, {{[red dwarfs](red%20dwarf.md) directly turn into [blue dwarfs](blue%20dwarf%20(red-dwarf%20stage).md) after using up most of its [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) (and then later, [white dwarf](whit%20dwarf.md))}}, but this has {{yet to taken place due to predicted lifespans of red dwarfs being in the trillions of years}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-26,73,310!2024-09-28,47,290!2024-09-25,44,290!2024-09-14,29,250!2024-09-27,46,290-->

## luminosity-color variation

As {{non-fusing helium accumulates in the core of a main-sequence star}}, {{the reduction in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass}}. Since {{it is fusion-supplied power that maintains the pressure of the core and supports the higher layers of the star}} (also contributes partially: {{less nuclei per unit mass in the core, as 4 hydrogen nuclei are fused into 1 helium nucleus}}), the core {{gradually gets compressed}}. This brings {{hydrogen-rich material into a shell around the helium-rich core at a depth where the pressure is sufficient for fusion to occur}}, refilling {{the core with hydrogen}}. Yet, the core is {{more compressed and hotter (higher temperature is needed to maintain the same outward pressure)}}, so {{the overall fusion rate increases}}. {{The higher power output}} from this shell {{pushes the higher layers of the star further out}}. This causes {{a gradual increase in the radius and consequently luminosity of the star over time}}. For example, the luminosity of the early Sun was {{only about 70% of its current value}}. As a star ages it thus {{changes its position on the HR diagram}}. This evolution is reflected in {{a (up-right) broadening of the main sequence band which contains stars at various evolutionary stages}}. {{The initial positions of new-born stars at differing masses}} is called {{the _zero-age main sequence_ (_ZAMS_) _line_}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-18,62,323!2024-09-23,38,283!2024-09-22,37,283!2024-09-07,24,283!2024-09-23,38,283!2024-09-21,36,283!2024-10-15,59,323!2024-10-06,49,303!2024-10-04,47,303!2024-10-10,51,303!2024-10-10,52,303!2024-10-02,45,303!2024-10-16,60,323!2024-11-03,75,323!2024-09-17,34,283!2024-10-28,70,323!2024-08-21,18,303-->
