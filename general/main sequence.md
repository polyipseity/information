# main sequence

The more [massive](mass.md) a [star](star.md) is, {@{the shorter its lifespan on the main sequence}@}. After {@{the [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) fuel at the core has been consumed}@}, the star {@{[evolves](stellar%20evolution.md) away from the main sequence on the [HR diagram](Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md), into a [supergiant](supergiant.md), [red giant](red%20giant.md), or directly to a [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md)}@}. Hypothetically, {@{[red dwarfs](red%20dwarf.md) directly turn into [blue dwarfs](blue%20dwarf%20(red-dwarf%20stage).md) after using up most of its [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) (and then later, [white dwarf](whit%20dwarf.md))}@}, but this has {@{yet to taken place due to predicted lifespans of red dwarfs being in the trillions of years}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-14,323,330!2025-02-09,134,290!2025-01-30,127,290!2025-05-24,180,250!2025-03-30,184,310-->

## luminosity-color variation

As {@{non-fusing helium accumulates in the core of a main-sequence star}@}, {@{the reduction in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass}@}. Since {@{it is fusion-supplied power that maintains the pressure of the core and supports the higher layers of the star}@} (also contributes partially: {@{less nuclei per unit mass in the core, as 4 hydrogen nuclei are fused into 1 helium nucleus}@}), the core {@{gradually gets compressed}@}. This brings {@{hydrogen-rich material into a shell around the helium-rich core at a depth where the pressure is sufficient for fusion to occur}@}, refilling {@{the core with hydrogen}@}. Yet, the core is {@{more compressed and hotter (higher temperature is needed to maintain the same outward pressure)}@}, so {@{the overall fusion rate increases}@}. {@{The higher power output}@} from this shell {@{pushes the higher layers of the star further out}@}. This causes {@{a gradual increase in the radius and consequently luminosity of the star over time}@}. For example, the luminosity of the early Sun was {@{only about 70% of its current value}@}. As a star ages it thus {@{changes its position on the HR diagram}@}. This evolution is reflected in {@{a (up-right) broadening of the main sequence band which contains stars at various evolutionary stages}@}. {@{The initial positions of new-born stars at differing masses}@} is called {@{the _zero-age main sequence_ (_ZAMS_) _line_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-01,287,343!2025-01-11,110,283!2025-01-06,106,283!2024-12-12,96,303!2025-02-21,151,303!2024-12-31,101,283!2025-05-01,197,323!2025-05-01,205,323!2025-04-22,196,323!2025-03-13,154,303!2025-03-16,157,303!2025-04-10,190,323!2025-07-24,281,343!2025-10-05,336,343!2025-01-28,133,303!2025-09-19,326,343!2025-10-11,340,343-->
