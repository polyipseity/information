# ellipse

In [mathematics](mathematics.md), an {{__ellipse__}} is {{a [plane curve](plane%20curve.md) surrounding two [focal points](focus%20(geometry).md), such that for all points on the curve, the sum of the two distances to the focal points is a constant}}. The elongation of an ellipse is measured by {{its [eccentricity](eccntricity%20(mathematics).md) $e$, a number ranging from $e = 0$ (the [limiting case](limiting%20case%20(mathematics).md) of a [circle](circle.md)) to $e = 1$ (the limiting case of infinite elongation, no longer an ellipse but a [parabola](parabola.md))}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-16,72,310!2024-09-18,18,270!2024-09-23,53,310-->

[Analytically](analytic%20geometry.md), the equation of a standard ellipse {{centered at the origin with width $2w$ and height $2h$}} is: {{$$\frac {x^2} {w^2} + \frac {y^2} {h^2} = 1$$}}. Assuming $w \ge h$ for the rest of this paragraph, the foci are {{$(\pm c, 0)$ for $c = \sqrt{w^2 - h^2}$}}. The eccentricity $e$ is {{$\frac c w$}}. $w$ and $h$ are also called {{respectively [semi-major axis](semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes.md) and [semi-minor axis](semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-19,49,290!2025-01-19,140,310!2024-12-31,111,270!2024-10-05,50,250!2024-09-26,54,310-->
