# filtration

__Filtration__ is {{a physical [separation process](separation%20process.md) that separates [solid](solid.md) from [fluid](fluid.md) in a [mixture](mixture.md) using a _[filter medium](#filter%20medium)_}}. Solid that cannot pass through is called the {{_residue_}} and fluid that passes through is called the {{_filtrate_}}. <!--SR:!2024-03-03,176,210!2023-12-09,186,310!2023-12-14,190,310-->

## filter medium

A filter medium is {{a material used to separate}}. <!--SR:!2024-01-03,211,310-->

There are two main types of filter media: {{_surface filter_, a solid [sieve](sieve.md) that traps the solid with or without [filter paper](filter%20paper.md)}}, and {{_depth filter_, a bed of granular material retaining the solid as they pass through}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-21,302,250!2024-01-27,176,270-->
