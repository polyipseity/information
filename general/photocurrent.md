# photocurrent

__Photocurrent__ is {{the [electric current](electric%20current.md) through a [photosensitive](photosensitivity.md) device due to exposure to [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md)}}. It may be caused by {{[photoelectric effect](photoelectric%20effect.md) or [photovoltaic effect](photovoltaic%20effect.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-11-24,129,230!2024-02-18,320,290-->

## calculation

The photocurrent can be calculated by the following equation:
{{$$I_p=\frac{Q}t$$}}
where {{$Q$ is the [electric charge](electric%20charge.md) transferred over time $t$}}. If $Q$ is in [coulombs](coulomb.md) and $t$ is in [seconds](second.md), $I_p$ is in [amperes](ampere.md). <!--SR:!2024-01-13,317,330!2023-12-20,284,290-->

## external voltage

By applying an external [voltage](voltage.md), the photocurrent can be {{changed}}. A voltage that increases the photocurrent ({{positive voltage}}) is called {{accelerating potential}}, while the inverse ({{negative voltage}}) is called {{retarding potential}}. <!--SR:!2024-01-11,269,270!2023-10-19,249,330!2024-12-02,540,310!2023-12-30,305,330!2023-12-02,284,330-->

An accelerating potential {{increases the photocurrent}}, but only up to a point called {{saturation current $I_s$}}. The potential {{attracts electrons to the anode}}, {{increasing the number of captured electrons}}, thus the photocurrent. The saturation current is reached when {{no more additional electrons can be captured}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-13,515,310!2023-12-14,293,330!2023-11-10,239,270!2024-01-05,265,270!2023-12-25,257,270-->

An retarding potential {{decreases the photocurrent}}. By increasing the retarding potential, when the photocurrent {{just reach zero}}, the potential at that point is called {{stopping potential or cut-off potential $V_0$}}. The potential {{repels electrons}}, {{preventing low-energy electrons from reaching the anode}}, thus decreasing the photocurrent. When the stopping potential is reached, {{even the most energetic electron of kinetic energy $K_\mathrm{max}$ is stopped}}, so the photocurrent is zero. In this case, the stopping potential is related by {{$\mathrm{e}V_0=K_\mathrm{max}$}}. <!--SR:!2024-03-30,345,290!2023-12-09,261,270!2025-03-07,544,270!2024-07-21,410,270!2023-12-22,185,230!2023-10-01,91,190!2023-11-16,238,290-->

The resulting photocurrent-voltage curve is {{[sigmoidal](sigmoid%20function.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-11-05,262,330-->
