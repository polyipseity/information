# Dark Energy Survey

{{The __Dark Energy Survey__ (__DES__)}} is {{an [astronomical survey](astronomical%20survey.md) designed to constrain the properties of [dark energy](dark%20energy.md)}}. It uses {{images taken in the near-[ultraviolet](ultraviolet.md), [visible](visible%20spectrum.md), and near-[infrared](infrared.md)}} to {{measure the [expansion of the universe](expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md) using [Type Ia supernovae](Type%20Ia%20supernova.md), [baryon acoustic oscillations](baryon%20acoustic%20oscillations.md), the number of [galaxy clusters](galaxy%20groups%20and%20clusters.md), and [weak gravitational lensing](weak%20gravitational%20lensing.md)}}. The collaboration is composed of {{research institutions and universities}} from the United States, Australia, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Switzerland. The collaboration is {{divided into several scientific working groups}}. The director of DES is {{[Josh Frieman](Joshua%20A.%20Frieman.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-07,70,310!2025-06-11,234,330!2025-02-14,127,290!2024-11-17,64,250!2024-11-06,69,310!2025-03-17,160,310!2025-04-02,176,310-->
