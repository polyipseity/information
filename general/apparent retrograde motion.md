# apparent retrograde motion

__Apparent retrograde motion__ is {{the apparent motion of a [planet](planet.md) in a direction opposite to that of other bodies within its system, as observed from a particular vantage point}}. {{__Direct motion__ or __prograde motion__}} is {{motion in the same direction as other bodies}}. From [Earth](Earth.md), {{the [Sun](Sun.md)'s eastward motion day after day is the direction of direct motion}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-10,51,290!2024-07-22,13,290!2024-08-24,37,290!2024-07-23,14,290-->

## apparent motion

### from Earth

All [stars](star.md) and [planets](planet.md) appear to {{move from [east](east.md) to [west](west.md) due to [Earth](Earth.md)'s rotation, called [diurnal motion](diurnal%20motion.md)}}. Excluding this motion (by {{comparing the change in position in the [sky](sky.md) at the same time of each day}}), all other [planetary bodies](planetary-mass%20object.md) in the [Solar System](Solar%20System.md) also {{appear to move from the east to west as they cross Earth's sky, but periodically switch direction}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-31,41,290!2024-07-24,15,290!2024-08-25,35,270-->

The outer planets generally {{drift slowly eastward relative to the stars}}, but [asteroids](asteriod.md) and [Kuiper belt](Kuiper%20belt.md) objects (including [Pluto](Pluto.md)) exhibit {{apparent retrograde motion}}. As the eastward motion is {{normal for the planets, and so is considered direct motion}}. However, since Earth {{completes its orbit in a shorter period of time than the planets outside its orbit, it periodically overtakes them, like a faster car on a multi-lane highway}}. When this occurs, the planet being passed will {{first appear to stop its eastward drift, and then drift back toward the west}}. Then, as Earth {{swings past the planet in its orbit, it appears to resume its normal motion west to east}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-07,48,290!2024-09-05,46,290!2024-07-22,13,290!2024-08-29,42,290!2024-07-24,15,290!2024-08-10,23,270-->

Inner planets {{[Venus](Venus.md) and [Mercury](Mercury%20(planet).md)}} appear to {{move in retrograde in a similar mechanism}}, but as {{they can never be in opposition to the [Sun](Sun.md) as seen from [Earth](Earth.md), their retrograde cycles are tied to their inferior [conjunctions](conjunction%20(astronomy).md) with the Sun}}. They, when in retrograde motion, are likely {{unobservable in the Sun's glare and in their "new" phase, with mostly their dark sides toward Earth}}; they occur in the transition {{from evening star to morning star (for Venus; reversed for Mercury)}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-22,13,290!2024-09-03,44,290!2024-08-17,27,270!2024-08-19,32,290!2024-08-20,30,270-->
