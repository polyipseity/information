# retained earnings

The __retained earnings__ (also known as {{__plowback__}}<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup>) of a [corporation](corporation.md) is {{the accumulated [net income](net%20income.md) of the corporation that is retained by the corporation at a particular point in time}}, such as {{at the end of the reporting period}}. At the end of that period, {{the net income (or net loss) at that point is transferred from the Profit and Loss Account to the retained earnings account}}. If {{the balance of the retained earnings account is negative it may be called __accumulated losses__, __retained losses__, __accumulated deficit__, or similar terminology}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-04,57,310!2024-12-11,64,310!2024-12-06,59,310!2024-11-25,46,290!2024-11-30,53,310-->

Any part of a credit balance in the account can be {{capitalised, by the issue of [bonus shares](bonus%20share.md)}}, and the balance is available for {{distribution of [dividends](dividend.md) to [shareholders](shareholder.md), and the residue is carried forward into the next period}}. {{Some laws, including those of most states in the United States}} require that {{dividends be only paid out of the positive balance of the retained earnings account at the time that payment is to be made}}. This {{protects creditors from a company being liquidated through dividends}}. {{A few states}}, however, allow {{payment of dividends to continue to increase a corporation’s accumulated deficit}}. This is known as {{a liquidating dividend or liquidating cash dividend}}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-11-20,43,290!2024-11-22,45,290!2024-12-05,58,310!2024-12-11,62,310!2024-11-28,51,310!2024-12-18,69,310!2024-12-04,57,310!2024-12-02,55,310-->

In [accounting](accounting.md), the retained earnings at the end of one accounting period are {{the opening retained earnings in the next period}}, to which is {{added the net income or net loss (including taxes) for that period}} and from which is {{deducted the bonus shares issued in the financial period (usually a year) and dividends paid in that period (so net income or loss excludes bonus shares and dividends)}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-06,59,310!2024-12-11,64,310!2024-11-05,34,290-->

If {{a company is publicly held}}, the balance of retained earnings account that is negatively referred to as "accumulated deficit" may {{appear in the Accountant's Opinion in what is called the "Ongoing Concern" statement}} located at {{the end of required SEC financial reporting at the end of each quarter}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-15,66,310!2024-11-25,48,290!2024-11-03,32,290-->

Retained earnings are {{reported in the [shareholders' equity](equity%20(finance).md) section of the corporation's [balance sheet](balance%20sheet.md)}}. Corporations with net accumulated losses may {{refer to negative shareholders' equity as positive _shareholders' deficit_}}. A report of the movements in retained earnings is presented along with {{[other comprehensive income](accumulated%20other%20comprehensive%20income.md) and changes in [share capital](share%20capital.md) in the [statement of changes in equity](statement%20of%20changes%20in%20equity.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-11,39,290!2024-11-04,27,270!2024-12-05,47,250-->

Due to {{the nature of [double-entry](double-entry%20bookkeeping.md) [accrual accounting](accrual.md)}}, retained earnings {{do not represent surplus cash available to a company}}. Rather, they represent {{how the company has managed its profits (i.e. whether it has distributed them as dividends or reinvested them in the business)}}. When reinvested, those retained earnings are {{reflected as increases in assets (which could include cash) or reductions to liabilities on the balance sheet}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-07,60,310!2024-12-09,60,310!2024-11-28,51,310!2024-11-13,36,270-->

## stockholders' equity

When {{total assets are greater than total liabilities}}, stockholders have {{a positive equity (positive [book value](book%20value.md))}}. Conversely, when {{total liabilities are greater than total assets, stockholders have a negative stockholders' equity (negative book value) — also sometimes called stockholders' deficit}}. A stockholders' deficit does not mean that {{stockholders owe money to the corporation as they own only its net assets and are not accountable for its [liabilities](liability%20(financial%20accounting).md)}}, though {{it is one of the definitions of [insolvency](insolvency.md)}}. This means that {{the value of the assets of the company must rise above its liabilities}} before the stockholders hold positive equity value in the company. <!--SR:!2024-12-14,65,310!2024-11-23,46,290!2024-11-25,48,290!2024-11-07,30,270!2024-11-26,47,290!2024-12-05,58,310-->

- retained earnings equation ::: retained earnings = opening retained earnings + current year net profit from p&l a/c - dividends paid in the current year <!--SR:!2024-11-05,28,270!2024-12-19,70,310-->

## tax implications

A company is normally subject to {{a company tax on the net income of the company in a financial year}}. The amount added to retained earnings is {{generally the after tax net income}}. In {{most cases in most jurisdictions}} {{no tax is payable on the accumulated earnings retained by a company}}. However, this {{creates a potential for [tax avoidance](tax%20avoidance.md)}}, because {{the corporate tax rate is usually lower than the higher marginal rates for some individual taxpayers}}. Higher income taxpayers could {{"park" income inside a private company instead of being paid out as a dividend and then taxed at the individual rates}}. To {{remove this tax benefit}}, some jurisdictions {{impose an "[undistributed profits tax](undistributed%20profits%20tax.md)" on retained earnings of private companies, usually at the highest individual marginal tax rate}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-13,41,290!2024-10-25,25,270!2024-12-11,62,310!2024-11-27,50,310!2024-11-26,49,310!2024-11-25,48,290!2024-11-27,50,290!2024-12-03,56,310!2024-11-29,52,290-->

{{The issue of [bonus shares](bonus%20share.md), even if funded out of retained earnings}}, will in {{most jurisdictions}} {{not be treated as a dividend distribution and not taxed in the hands of the shareholder}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-10,38,290!2024-11-19,42,290!2024-10-20,20,270-->

Retaining earnings by a company {{increases the company's shareholder equity, which increases the value of each shareholder's shareholding}}. This {{increases the share price, which may result in a [capital gains tax](capital%20gains%20tax.md) liability when the shares are disposed of}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-09,62,310!2024-11-07,30,270-->

The decision of {{whether a corporation should retain net income or have it paid out as dividends}} depends on several factors including, but not limited to: <!--SR:!2024-12-03,56,310-->

- [Tax treatment of dividends](dividend%20tax.md), and
- Funds required for reinvestment in the corporation (called retention).

A number of factors affect the decision of {{the amount of profit that a corporation should retain}}, including: <!--SR:!2024-11-20,43,290-->

- Quantum of net profit
- Age of the business enterprise
- Dividend policy of the corporation
- Future plan regarding modernization and expansion
