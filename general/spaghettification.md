# spaghettification

In [astrophysics](astrophysics.md), __spaghettification__ (sometimes referred to as the __noodle effect__) is {@{the vertical stretching and horizontal compression of objects into long thin shapes (rather like [spaghetti](spaghetti.md)) in a very strong, non-[homogeneous](homogeneity%20and%20heterogeneity.md) [gravitational field](gravitational%20field.md)}@}. It is caused by {@{extreme [tidal forces](tidal%20force.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-19,105,290!2025-07-08,266,330-->
