# Moon

The __Moon__ is {{[Earth](Earth.md)'s only [natural satellite](natural%20satellite.md)}}.  It [orbits](orbit%20of%20th%20Moon.md) at an [average distance](lunar%20distancee.md) of {{384&nbsp;400 km (238&nbsp;900 mi), about 30 times the diameter of Earth}}. [Tidal forces](tidal%20forces.md) {{between Earth and the Moon have over time [synchronized](tidal%20locking.md) the Moon's orbital period ([lunar month](lunar%20month.md)) with its rotation period ([lunar day](lunar%20day.md)) at 29.5 Earth days}}, causing {{the [same side](near%20side%20of%20the%20Moon.md) of the Moon to always face Earth}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-19,59,310!2024-08-28,32,252!2024-10-04,69,312!2024-09-30,65,312-->

## Earth–Moon system

### orbit

The [Moon](Moon.md) makes a complete orbit around [Earth](Earth.md) with respect to the [fixed stars](fixed%20star.md), {{its [sidereal period](orbital%20period.md), about once every 27.3 days}}. However, because {{the Earth-Moon system, meanwhile, moves in the same direction in its orbit around the [Sun](Sun.md)}}, it {{takes slightly longer, 29.5 days to return at the same [lunar phase](lunar%20phase.md), completing a full cycle, as seen from [Earth](Earth.md)}}. This {{[synodic period](orbital%20period.md#synodic%20period) or synodic month}} is commonly known as {{the [lunar month](lunar%20month.md) and is equal to the length of the [solar day](synodic%20day.md) on the Moon}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-22,122,292!2024-12-04,109,292!2024-09-16,56,312!2024-10-01,66,312!2024-09-06,45,292-->

Due to {{[tidal locking](tidal%20locking.md)}}, the [Moon](Moon.md) has {{a 1:1 [spin–orbit resonance](orbital%20resonance.md). This [rotation](rotation.md)–[orbit](orbit.md) ratio makes the Moon's (sidereal, synodic, etc.) orbital periods around Earth equal to its corresponding (sidereal, synodic, etc.) [rotation periods](rotation%20period%20(astronomy).md)}}. This is the reason for {{only one side of the Moon, its so-called [near side](near%20side%20of%20the%20Moon.md), being visible from Earth}}. That said, while {{the movement of the Moon is in resonance, it still is not without nuances such as [libration](libration.md)}}, resulting in {{slightly changing perspectives, making over time and location on Earth about 59% of the Moon's surface visible from Earth}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-24,63,312!2024-09-16,51,292!2024-09-10,45,292!2024-08-27,40,292!2024-09-07,46,292-->
