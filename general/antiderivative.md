# antiderivative

In [calculus](calculus.md), an __antiderivative__, __inverse derivative__, __primitive function__, __primitive integral__, or __indefinite integral__ of a [function](function%20(mathematics).md) $f$ is {{a [differentiable function](differentiable%20function.md) $F$ whose [derivative](derivative.md) is the original function $f$ in all of its [function domain](domain%20of%20a%20function.md) when the domain is an union of open [intervals](interval%20(mathematics).md)}}. For closed or semi-closed intervals, {{the above definition can be extended by requiring $F$ to be an antiderivative of $f$ on the [interior](interior%20(topology).md) of the interval (i.e. the corresponding open interval), and additionally $F$ is [left- or right-continuous](continuous%20function.md#directional%20and%20semi-continuity) (i.e. continuous approaching from the interior) on the endpoints of the interval}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-19,134,250!2024-08-17,90,293-->

Antiderivatives are related to {{[definite integrals](integral.md) through the [second fundamental theorem of calculus](fundamental%20theorem%20of%20calculus.md#second%20part)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-25,90,270-->

It is important to note {{antiderivatives and integrability are not equivalent. A function that has antiderivatives may not be [Riemann integrable](Riemann%20integral.md), and a Riemann integrable function may not have antiderivatives}}. If we replace the Riemann integral with {{[Henstock–Kurzweil integral](Henstock–Kurzweil%20integral.md), then a function that has antiderivatives is always integrable, though the converse is still not true}}. A [continuous function](continuous%20function.md) {{always has antiderivatives by the [first fundamental theorem of calculus](fundamental%20theorem%20of%20calculus.md#first%20part)}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-24,202,270!2024-11-01,122,250!2024-12-27,192,310-->
