# mass

Mass is {{an [intrinsic property](intrinsic%20and%20extrinsic%20properties.md) of a [body](physical%20object.md)}}. It was traditionally believed to be {{related to the [quantity](physical%20quantity.md) of [matter](matter.md) in a body}}, until {{the discovery of the [atom](atom.md) and [particle physics](particle%20physics.md)}}. It was found that {{different atoms and different [elementary particles](elementary%20particle.md), theoretically with the same amount of matter, have nonetheless different masses}}. Mass in [modern physics](modern%20physics.md) has {{[multiple definitions](mass%20in%20special%20relativity.md) which are conceptually distinct, but physically equivalent}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-05,15,290!2024-09-22,50,290!2024-08-06,16,290!2024-08-25,29,270!2024-10-02,59,310-->
