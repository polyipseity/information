# many-to-many (data model)

A __many-to-many__ relationship {{is a [cardinality](cardinality%20(data%20modeling).md) referring to a relationship between two entities A and B in which A is related to multiple Bs and vice versa}}.

## data relationships

In a [relational database management system](relational%20database.md#RDBMS), {{an [associative table](associative%20entity.md) is usually used to model many-to-many relationships, in which the associative table AB points to two other tables A and B}}.
