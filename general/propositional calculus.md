# propositional calculus

- Not to be confused with [propositional analysis](theory%20of%20descriptions.md).

The __propositional calculus__ is {{a branch of [logic](logic.md)}}. It is also called {{__propositional logic__, __statement logic__, __sentential calculus__, __sentential logic__, or sometimes __zeroth-order logic__}}. It deals with {{[propositions](proposition.md) (which can be [true or false](truth%20value.md)) and relations between propositions, including the construction of arguments based on them}}. Compound propositions are formed by {{connecting propositions by [logical connectives](logical%20connective.md) representing the [truth functions](truth%20function.md) of [conjunction](logical%20conjunction.md), [disjunction](logical%20disjunction.md), [implication](material%20conditional.md), [biconditional](logical%20biconditional.md), and [negation](negation.md)}}. Some sources {{include other connectives, as in the table below}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-25,57,310!2024-11-10,43,290!2024-11-16,50,310!2024-11-07,42,290!2024-11-03,40,290-->

Unlike {{[first-order logic](first-order%20logic.md)}}, propositional logic {{does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them, or [quantifiers](quantifier%20(logic).md)}}. However, all the machinery of propositional logic is {{included in first-order logic and higher-order logics. In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-24,56,310!2024-11-01,36,270!2024-11-29,60,310-->

Propositional logic is typically studied with {{a [formal language](formal%20language.md), in which propositions are represented by letters, which are called _[propositional variables](propositional%20variable.md)_}}. These are then used, {{together with symbols for connectives, to make compound propositions}}. Because of this, the propositional variables are called {{_[atomic formulas](atomic%20formula.md)_ of a formal zeroth-order language}}. While the atomic propositions are typically represented by {{letters of the [alphabet](alphabet.md), there is a variety of notations to represent the logical connectives}}. The following table shows the main notational variants for each of the connectives in propositional logic. <!--SR:!2024-11-26,58,310!2024-11-04,40,290!2025-02-26,122,290!2024-11-27,59,310-->

The most thoroughly researched branch of propositional logic is {{__classical truth-functional propositional logic__, in which formulas are interpreted as having precisely one of two possible [truth values](truth%20value.md), the truth value of _true_ or the truth value of _false_}}. {{The [principle of bivalence](principle%20of%20bivalence.md) and the [law of excluded middle](law%20of%20excluded%20middle.md)}} are upheld. By comparison with [first-order logic](first-order%20logic.md), {{truth-functional propositional logic is considered to be _zeroth-order logic_}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-31,38,290!2024-11-28,60,310!2024-11-04,41,290-->
