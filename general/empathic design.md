# empathic design

## characteristics

Empathy is the foundation of {{a human-centered design process}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-20,56,310-->

### difference from sympathy

Empathy is {{to understand or feel another person from their frame of perspective, i.e. placing one in others' shoes}}, while sympathy is {{simply expressing understanding or care for others' feeling}}. In terms of effect, empathy can drive {{connections while sympathy can do the opposite}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-12,27,270!2024-06-11,26,270!2024-07-24,59,310-->

For example, a sympathetic person seeing a homeless person might {{feel bad, donate some money, and go away}}, while an empathic person might {{spend time and attempt to connect with the person}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-04,68,310!2024-06-01,17,250-->

## process

In an empathic design process, we need to {{observe, immerse, engage, and understand}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-21,31,270-->

Observe {{views users and their behavior in the context of their lives}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-16,27,270-->

Immerse is {{experiencing in your users' shoes}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-21,57,310-->

Engage is {{interacting and interviewing users}}. When choosing people to interview, {{apart from normal users, also choose extreme users, as they can magnify the needs and potential solutions}}. For example, for a knife handle, {{apart from housewives and cooks, also interview people having problems holding a knife and master chefs}}. There are several methods to interview, such as {{interview or ethnographic research, focus group, survey or questionnaire, and other new methods like social media}}. Before the interview, {{prepare thoroughly, such as deciding on a goal, research user background, and prepare and prioritize questions}}. During interviews, one can use {{[5W1H](Five%20Ws.md): when, where, who, what, why, how; and draw a table}}. After interviewing, one can {{write the findings on sticky notes and paste it onto the [empathy map](empathy%20map.md)}}. Additionally, we can add {{2 new sections, pains and gains, to the map}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-18,55,310!2024-08-02,67,310!2024-06-23,34,270!2024-06-10,21,250!2024-06-11,22,250!2024-07-14,51,310!2024-06-26,37,270!2024-06-03,18,250-->

Understand is {{understanding the _real_ problems the users have}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-22,33,270-->
