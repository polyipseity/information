# incandescent light bulb

## other uses

An incandescent light bulb is an excellent [current limiter](current%20limiting.md) for some applications because of {{its nonlinear [resistance](electrical%20resistance%20and%20conductance.md). When the [current](electric%20current.md) is low, it is cold and its resistance is low, reducing [voltage drop](voltage%20drop.md) caused by it. When the current is high, it is hot and its resistance is high, limiting the current}}. Additionally, {{if the current is high, it glows due to its hotness, so it can also act as a [fault indicator](fault%20indicator.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-01-17,15,290!2024-03-06,51,310-->
