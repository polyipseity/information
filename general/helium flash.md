# helium flash

A __helium flash__ is {{a very brief [thermal runaway](thermal%20runaway.md) [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) of large quantities of [helium](helium.md) into [carbon](carbon.md) through the [triple-alpha process](triple-alpha%20process.md)}} in {{the core of low-mass [stars](star.md) (between 0.8 [solar masses](solar%20mass.md) ([M<sub>☉</sub>](solar%20mass.md)) and 2.0 M<sub>☉</sub>) during their [red giant](red%20giant.md) phase}}. The [Sun](Sun.md) is predicted to {{experience a flash 1.2 billion years after it leaves the [main sequence](main%20sequence.md)}}. A much rarer runaway helium fusion process can also occur {{on the surface of [accreting](accretion%20(astrophysics).md) [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md) stars}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-19,16,294!2024-08-18,7,210!2024-08-20,17,290!2024-08-14,11,270-->

Low-mass stars {{do not produce enough [gravitational](gravity.md) pressure to initiate normal helium fusion}}. As the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, {{some of the helium left behind is instead compacted into [degenerate matter](degenerate%20matter.md), supported against [gravitational collapse](gravitational%20collapse.md) by [quantum mechanical](quantum%20mechanics.md) pressure rather than [thermal pressure](ideal%20gas%20law.md)}}. Subsequent hydrogen shell fusion {{further increases the mass of the core until it reaches temperature of approximately 100 million [kelvin](Kelvin.md), which is hot enough to initiate helium fusion (or "helium burning") in the core}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-18,15,294!2024-08-24,13,254!2024-08-21,10,214-->

However, a fundamental quality of degenerate matter is that {{increases in temperature do not produce an increase in the pressure of the matter until the thermal pressure becomes so very high that it exceeds degeneracy pressure}}. In main sequence stars, {{[thermal expansion](hydrostatic%20equilibrium.md) regulates the core temperature}}, but {{in degenerate cores, this does not occur}}. Helium fusion {{increases the temperature, which increases the fusion rate}}, which {{further increases the temperature in a runaway reaction which quickly spans the entire core}}. This produces {{a flash of very intense helium fusion that lasts only a few minutes, but during that time, produces energy at a rate comparable to the entire [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md) galaxy}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-20,17,294!2024-08-16,13,290!2024-08-17,14,290!2024-08-19,16,290!2024-08-18,15,294!2024-09-03,22,270-->

In the case of normal low-mass stars, {{the vast energy release causes much of the core to come out of degeneracy, allowing it to thermally expand}}. This {{consumes most of the total energy released by the helium flash, and any left-over energy is absorbed into the star's upper layers}}. Thus the helium flash is {{mostly undetectable by observation, and is described solely by astrophysical models}}. After the core's expansion and cooling, {{the star's surface rapidly cools and contracts in as little as 10&nbsp;000 years until it is roughly 2% of its former radius and luminosity}}. It is estimated that {{the electron-degenerate helium core weighs about 40% of the star mass and that 6% of the core is converted into carbon}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-18,15,294!2024-09-02,21,270!2024-08-19,16,294!2024-08-25,14,254!2024-08-15,7,230-->
