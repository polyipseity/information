# diffuse sky radiation

## color

[Earth's atmosphere](atmosphere%20of%20Earth.md) scatters {{short-[wavelength](wavelength.md) light more efficiently than that of longer wavelengths}}. Because its wavelengths are shorter, {{blue light is more strongly scattered than the longer-wavelength lights, red or green}}. Hence, the result that when looking at the [sky](sky.md) {{away from the direct incident [sunlight](sunlight.md), the [human eye](human%20eye.md) perceives the sky to be blue}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-27,62,310!2024-09-11,41,250!2024-10-01,66,310-->

Daily at {{any global venue experiencing [sunrise](sunrise.md) or [sunset](sunset.md)}}, most of the solar beam of visible [sunlight](sunlight.md) {{arrives nearly [tangentially](tangent%20lines%20to%20circles.md) to [Earth](Earth.md)'s surface}}. Here, {{the path of sunlight [through the atmosphere](air%20mass%20(astronomy).md) is [elongated](optical%20path%20length.md) such that much of the blue or green light is scattered away from the line of perceivable visible light}}. This phenomenon leaves {{the Sun's rays, and the clouds they illuminate, abundantly orange-to-red in colors}}, which one sees when looking at a sunset or sunrise. <!--SR:!2024-09-13,52,310!2024-09-12,52,310!2024-11-12,82,270!2024-10-03,63,270-->
