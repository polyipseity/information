# cluster analysis

## definitions

Typical cluster models include:

- connectivity models ::@:: For example, the [hierarchical clustering](hierarchical%20clustering.md) builds or divides into clusters based on distance connectivity. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,304,290!2025-04-20,286,330-->
- centroid models ::@:: For example, the [k-means clustering](k-means%20clustering.md) represents each cluster by its mean vector. <!--SR:!2024-12-27,192,310!2025-03-07,252,330-->
