# dark energy

In [physical cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md) and [astronomy](astronomy.md), __dark energy__ is {{an unknown form of [energy](energy.md) that affects the [universe](universe.md) on the largest scales}}. Its primary effect is to drive the [accelerating expansion of the universe](accelerating%20expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md). Assuming that the [lambda-CDM model](Lambda-CDM%20model.md) of cosmology is correct, dark energy is the dominant component of the universe, contributing 68% of the total energy in the present-day [observable universe](observable%20universe.md) while [dark matter](dark%20matter.md) and [ordinary (baryonic)](baryon.md#baryonic%20matter) matter contribute 26% and 5%, respectively, and other components such as [neutrinos](neutrino.md) and [photons](photon.md) are nearly negligible. Dark energy's [density](density.md) is very low: 7×10<sup>−30</sup> g/cm<sup>3</sup> (6×10<sup>−10</sup> J/m<sup>3</sup> in [mass-energy](mass–energy%20equivalence.md)), much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies. However, it dominates the universe's mass–energy content because it is uniform across space. <!--SR:!2024-10-30,55,310-->

## evidence of existence

The evidence for dark energy is {{indirect but comes from three independent sources}}: <!--SR:!2024-11-18,70,310-->

- distance and redshift ::: Distance measurements and their relation to [redshift](redshift.md), which suggest the universe has expanded more in the latter half of its life. <!--SR:!2024-10-12,40,290!2024-10-29,54,310-->
- curvature of the universe ::: The theoretical need for a type of additional energy that is not matter or dark matter to form the [observationally flat universe](shape%20of%20the%20universe.md#curvature%20of%20the%20universe) (absence of any detectable global curvature). <!--SR:!2024-10-30,55,310!2024-10-09,35,270-->

### supernovae

In {{1998}}, {{the [High-Z Supernova Search Team](High-Z%20Supernova%20Search%20Team.md)}} published {{observations of [Type Ia](Type%20Ia%20supernova.md) ("one-A") [supernovae](supernova.md)}}. In {{1999}}, {{the [Supernova Cosmology Project](Supernova%20Cosmology%20Project.md)}} followed by {{suggesting that the expansion of the universe is [accelerating](deceleration%20parameter.md)}}. {{The 2011 [Nobel Prize in Physics](list%20of%20Nobel%20laureates%20in%20Physics.md)}} was awarded to {{[Saul Perlmutter](Saul%20Perlmutter.md), [Brian P. Schmidt](Brian%20Schmidt.md), and [Adam G. Riess](Adam%20Riess.md) for their leadership in the discovery}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-28,120,290!2024-10-09,39,290!2024-10-28,53,310!2025-02-27,142,290!2024-11-09,63,310!2024-10-10,39,290!2025-01-20,112,290!2024-11-09,52,250-->

### cosmic microwave background

The existence of dark energy, in whatever form, is {{needed to reconcile the measured geometry of space with the total amount of matter in the universe}}. {{Measurements of [cosmic microwave background](cosmic%20microwave%20background.md) [anisotropies](anisotropy.md)}} indicate that {{the universe is close to [flat](flatness%20problem.md). For the [shape of the universe](shape%20of%20the%20universe.md) to be flat}}, {{the mass–energy density of the universe must be equal to the [critical density](friedmann%20equations.md#density%20parameter)}}. {{The total amount of matter in the universe (including [baryons](baryon.md) and [dark matter](dark%20matter.md))}}, as measured from the cosmic microwave background spectrum, accounts for {{only about 30% of the critical density}}. This implies {{the existence of an additional form of energy to account for the remaining 70%}}. {{The [Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe](Wilkinson%20Microwave%20Anisotropy%20Probe.md) (WMAP) spacecraft [seven-year analysis](Wilkinson%20Microwave%20Anisotropy%20Probe.md#seven-year%20data%20release)}} estimated a universe made up of {{72.8% dark energy, 22.7% dark matter, and 4.5% ordinary matter}}. Work done in {{2013 based on the [Planck spacecraft](planck%20(spacecraft).md) observations of the cosmic microwave background}} gave a more accurate estimate of {{68.3% dark energy, 26.8% dark matter, and 4.9% ordinary matter}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-08,63,310!2024-11-07,62,310!2024-11-20,72,310!2025-01-08,97,290!2024-11-21,73,310!2024-10-17,44,290!2024-10-24,50,310!2025-01-05,103,290!2024-11-10,40,210!2024-10-21,49,290!2024-12-20,80,250-->
