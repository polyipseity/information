# active galactic nucleus

{@{An __active galactic nucleus__ (__AGN__)}@} is {@{a compact region at the center of a [galaxy](galaxy.md) that emits a significant amount of energy across the [electromagnetic spectrum](electromagnetic%20spectrum.md), with characteristics indicating that this luminosity is not produced by the [stars](star.md)}@}. Such excess, non-stellar emissions have been observed {@{in the [radio](radio%20wave.md), [microwave](microwave.md), [infrared](infrared.md), [optical](visible%20spectrum.md), [ultra-violet](ultraviolet.md), [X-ray](X-ray.md) and [gamma ray](gamma%20ray.md) wavebands}@}. A galaxy hosting an AGN is {@{called an __active galaxy__}@}. The non-stellar radiation from an AGN is theorized to {@{result from the [accretion](accretion%20(astrophysics).md) of matter by a [supermassive black hole](supermassive%20black%20hole.md) at the center of its host galaxy}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-18,257,330!2025-01-28,110,290!2024-11-23,62,270!2025-08-12,276,330!2025-06-09,208,310-->

Active galactic nuclei are {@{the most luminous persistent sources of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) in the universe and}@}, as such, can be {@{used as a means of discovering distant objects}@}; their evolution {@{as a function of cosmic time also puts constraints on [models of the cosmos](cosmology.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-24,285,330!2025-04-26,178,310!2025-07-16,256,330-->

The observed characteristics of an AGN depend on {@{several properties such as the mass of the central black hole, the rate of gas accretion onto the black hole, the orientation of the [accretion disk](accretion%20disk.md), the degree of [obscuration](extinction%20(astronomy).md) of the nucleus by [dust](cosmic%20dust.md), and presence or absence of [jets](astrophysical%20jet.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-26,79,250-->

{@{Numerous subclasses of AGN}@} have been defined on {@{the basis of their observed characteristics}@}; {@{the most powerful AGN}@} are classified as {@{[quasars](quasar.md)}@}. {@{A [blazar](blazar.md)}@} is {@{an AGN with a jet pointed toward the Earth, in which radiation from the jet is enhanced by [relativistic beaming](relativistic%20beaming.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-04,293,330!2025-04-19,185,310!2025-02-28,134,290!2025-06-10,208,310!2025-05-06,194,310!2025-04-20,184,310-->

## unification of AGN species

Unified models propose that {@{different observational classes of AGN are a single type of physical object observed under different conditions}@}. The currently favoured unified models are {@{'orientation-based unified models' meaning that they propose that the apparent differences between different types of objects arise simply because of their different orientations to the observer}@}. However, {@{they are debated}@} (see below). <!--SR:!2025-06-19,230,321!2024-11-21,73,321!2024-11-22,74,321-->
