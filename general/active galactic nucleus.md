# active galactic nucleus

{{An __active galactic nucleus__ (__AGN__)}} is {{a compact region at the center of a [galaxy](galaxy.md) that emits a significant amount of energy across the [electromagnetic spectrum](electromagnetic%20spectrum.md), with characteristics indicating that this luminosity is not produced by the [stars](star.md)}}. Such excess, non-stellar emissions have been observed {{in the [radio](radio%20wave.md), [microwave](microwave.md), [infrared](infrared.md), [optical](visible%20spectrum.md), [ultra-violet](ultraviolet.md), [X-ray](X-ray.md) and [gamma ray](gamma%20ray.md) wavebands}}. A galaxy hosting an AGN is {{called an __active galaxy__}}. The non-stellar radiation from an AGN is theorized to {{result from the [accretion](accretion%20(astrophysics).md) of matter by a [supermassive black hole](supermassive%20black%20hole.md) at the center of its host galaxy}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-20,3,250!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270-->

Active galactic nuclei are {{the most luminous persistent sources of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) in the universe and}}, as such, can be {{used as a means of discovering distant objects}}; their evolution {{as a function of cosmic time also puts constraints on [models of the cosmos](cosmology.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270-->

The observed characteristics of an AGN depend on {{several properties such as the mass of the central black hole, the rate of gas accretion onto the black hole, the orientation of the [accretion disk](accretion%20disk.md), the degree of [obscuration](extinction%20(astronomy).md) of the nucleus by [dust](cosmic%20dust.md), and presence or absence of [jets](astrophysical%20jet.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-20,3,250-->

{{Numerous subclasses of AGN}} have been defined on {{the basis of their observed characteristics}}; {{the most powerful AGN}} are classified as {{[quasars](quasar.md)}}. {{A [blazar](blazar.md)}} is {{an AGN with a jet pointed toward the Earth, in which radiation from the jet is enhanced by [relativistic beaming](relativistic%20beaming.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270-->

## unification of AGN species

Unified models propose that {{different observational classes of AGN are a single type of physical object observed under different conditions}}. The currently favoured unified models are {{'orientation-based unified models' meaning that they propose that the apparent differences between different types of objects arise simply because of their different orientations to the observer}}. However, {{they are debated}} (see below).
