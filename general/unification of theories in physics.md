# unification of theories in physics

## unification of gravity and astronomy

The "first great unification" was {{[Isaac Newton](Issac%20Newton.md)'s 17th century [unification of gravity](Newton's%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation.md)}}, which {{brought together the understandings of the observable phenomena of gravity on Earth with the observable behavior of [celestial bodies](astronomical%20object.md) in [space](outer%20space.md)}}.
