# asset

In [financial accounting](financial%20accounting.md), an __asset__ is {@{any [resource](resource.md) owned or controlled by a business or an economic entity}@}. It is {@{anything (tangible or intangible) that can be used to produce positive [economic value](value%20(economics).md)}@}. Assets represent {@{value of [ownership](ownership.md) that can be converted into [cash](cash.md) (although cash itself is also considered an asset)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {@{The [balance sheet](balance%20sheet.md) of a firm}@} records {@{the monetary<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> value of the assets owned by that firm}@}. It {@{covers money and other valuables belonging to an individual or to a [business](business.md)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> _Total assets_ can also be called {@{the _balance sheet total_}@}.

Assets can be {@{grouped into two major classes: [tangible assets](tangible%20property.md) and [intangible assets](intangible%20asset.md)}@}. Tangible assets contain {@{various subclasses, including [current assets](current%20asset.md) and [fixed assets](fixed%20asset.md)}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> Current assets include {@{[cash](cash.md), [inventory](inventory.md), [accounts receivable](accounts%20receivable.md)}@}, while fixed assets include {@{[land](land.md), [buildings](building.md) and [equipment](fixed%20asset.md)}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> Intangible assets are {@{non-physical resources and rights that have a value to the firm because they give the firm an advantage in the marketplace}@}. Intangible assets include {@{[goodwill](goodwill%20(accounting).md), [intellectual property](intellectual%20property.md) (such as [copyrights](copyright.md), [trademarks](trademark.md), [patents](patent.md), [computer programs](computer%20program.md))}@},<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> and {@{financial assets, including financial investments, [bonds](bond%20(finance).md), and companies' [shares](share%20capital.md)}@}.

In some cases, the _Historical Cost_ is used; such that the value of the asset when it was bought in the past is used as the monetary value. In other instances, the present [fair market value](fair%20market%20value.md) of the asset is used to determine the value shown on the balance sheet. <a id="^ref-2"></a>^ref-2
