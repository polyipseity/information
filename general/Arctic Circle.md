# Arctic Circle

The __Arctic Circle__ is {{the [circle of altitude](circle%20of%20altitude.md) marking the [southernmost](south.md) [latitude](latitude.md) at which the [Sun](Sun.md) is above the [horizon](horizon.md) for 24 continuous hours at least once per year}}. The duration becomes longer {{the [norther](north.md) one goes, reaching about 6 months at the [North Pole](North%20Pole.md)}}. These are also true for the [southern](south.md) equivalent, {{the [Antarctic Circle](Antarctic%20Circle.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-31,190,310!2025-07-05,278,330!2025-05-28,252,330-->
