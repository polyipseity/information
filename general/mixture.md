# mixture

A __mixture__ is {{a matter made up of multiple [chemical substances](chemical%20substance.md) which are not chemically bonded}}. It is impure. <!--SR:!2025-08-01,532,250-->

## properties

Compare with [chemical substance ยง properties](chemical%20substance.md#properties).

- composition: {{variable}}
- formation: {{no [chemical reactions](chemical%20reaction.md), no to little energy change ([enthalpy of mixing](enthalpy%20of%20mixing.md))}}
- properties: {{each constituent keeps its properties}}
- separation: {{separable by physical and chemical methods}}
- [boiling point](boiling%20point.md) and [melting point](melting%20point.md): {{wide}} <!--SR:!2024-06-28,293,270!2024-04-05,94,250!2025-08-29,644,310!2024-05-05,308,330!2024-03-20,275,330-->

## uniformity

A mixture is {{either _[homogeneous](#homogeneous%20mixture)_ or _[heterogeneous](#heterogeneous%20mixture)_}}. <!--SR:!2025-10-19,688,310-->

### homogeneous mixture

A homogeneous mixture has {{uniformly distributed constituents}}. <!--SR:!2026-04-13,783,290-->
