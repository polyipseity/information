# sidereal time

__Sidereal time__ is {{a calculation of the passage of [time](time.md) based on the positions of the [fixed stars](fixed%20stars.md)}}. The fundamental unit of sidereal time is {{the __sidereal day__, which is not the "day" most people are familiar with}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-22,65,310!2024-09-21,64,310-->

A sidereal day on [Earth](Earth.md) is {{approximately 86&nbsp;164.0905 seconds (23 h 56 min 4.0905 s or 23.934&nbsp;4696 h)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-25,28,210-->

## comparison to solar time

[Earth](Earth.md) makes {{one rotation around its axis each sidereal day}}; during that time {{it moves a short distance (about 1Â°) along its [orbit](orbit.md) around the [Sun](Sun.md)}}. So after a sidereal day has passed, Earth {{still needs to rotate slightly more before the Sun reaches local noon according to [solar time](solar%20time.md)}}. A mean solar day is, therefore, {{nearly 3 minutes 56 seconds longer than a sidereal day}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-16,147,310!2024-09-23,66,310!2025-02-17,170,310!2024-10-28,77,270-->

## sidereal days compared to solar days on other planets

For [prograde rotation](prograde%20motion.md), the formula relating the lengths of the sidereal and [solar days](synodic%20day.md) is: {{$$\text{number of sidereal days per orbital period} = \text{number of solar days per orbital period} + 1$$}}. Equivalently in terms of length, {{$$\begin{aligned} \text{length of sidereal day} & = \frac {\text{length of solar day} } {1 + \frac {\text{length of solar day} } {\text{orbital period} } } \\ \text{length of solar day} & = \frac {\text{length of sidereal day} } {1 - \frac {\text{length of sidereal day} } {\text{orbital period} } } \end{aligned}$$}}. The reasons for above formulas are {{similar to those for the [coin rotation paradox](coin%20rotation%20paradox.md)}}. The same analogy for [retrograde rotation](retrograde%20motion.md) {{would require the coin to slip at a particular speed, so does not exist sensibly}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-13,56,310!2024-09-30,58,270!2024-09-03,50,290!2024-09-22,65,310-->

For [retrograde rotation](prograde%20motion.md), the formula has {{the sign of $1$ negated}}: {{$$\text{number of sidereal days per orbital period} = \text{number of solar days per orbital period} - 1$$}}. Equivalently in terms of length, the formula has {{the operator sign in the denominator negated}}: {{$$\begin{aligned} \text{length of sidereal day} & = \frac {\text{length of solar day} } {1 - \frac {\text{length of solar day} } {\text{orbital period} } } \\ \text{length of solar day} & = \frac {\text{length of sidereal day} } {1 + \frac {\text{length of sidereal day} } {\text{orbital period} } } \end{aligned}$$}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-16,59,310!2024-09-15,58,310!2024-09-18,61,310!2024-10-08,66,270-->
