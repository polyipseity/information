# axial precession

In [astronomy](astronomy.md), __axial precession__, is {{a [gravity](gravity.md)-induced, slow, and continuous change in the orientation of an [astronomical body](astronomical%20object.md)'s [rotational axis](rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md)}}. In the absence of it, {{the astronomical object would show [axial parallelism](axial%20parallelism.md)}}.

In particular, for [Earth](Earth.md), axial precession can refer to {{the gradual shift in the orientation of Earth's axis of rotation in a cycle of approximately 26&nbsp;000 years}}. The orientation shift follows {{a circle in the westward direction (clockwise from the north)}}. The term "precession" only refers {{to the largest part of the gradual motion}}; other changes in the alignment of Earth's axis—{{[nutation](astronomical%20nutation.md) and [polar motion](polar%20motion.md)—are much smaller in magnitude}}.
