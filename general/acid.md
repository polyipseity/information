# acid

An __acid__ is {{a [molecule](molecule.md) or [ion](ion.md) that can donate a [proton](proton.md), known as a [Brønsted–Lowry acid](Brønsted–Lowry%20acid–base%20theory.md), or form a [coordinate covalent bond](coordinate%20covalent%20bond.md) by accepting an [electron pair](electron%20pair.md), known as a [Lewis acid](Lewis%20acids%20and%20bases.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-01-12,201,270-->

It is {{an [electrolyte](electrolyte.md)}}, tastes {{sour}}, turns {{blue [litmus](litmus.md) red}}, reacts with some [metals](metal.md) to {{form [salts](salt%20(chemistry).md)}}, and [neutralizes](neutralization%20(chemistry).md) {{[bases](base%20(chemistry).md) to form [salts](salt%20(chemistry).md)}}. {{[Strong acids](acid%20strength.md) and some concentrated weak acids}} are [corrosive](corrsive%20substance.md). <!--SR:!2023-12-17,201,310!2024-05-08,316,330!2023-09-27,136,290!2024-02-24,232,270!2024-09-04,386,290!2024-07-18,352,290-->

Common aqueous acids include {{[hydrochloric acid](hydrochloric%20acid) (HCl), [sulfuric acid](sulfuric%20acid.md) (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), and [nitric acid](nitric%20acid.md) (HNO<sub>3</sub>)}}. These three are also called {{[mineral acids](mineral%20acid.md) because they are [inorganic](inorganic%20chemistry.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-04-28,308,330!2023-09-28,128,290-->

## nomenclature

[Arrhenius acids](#Arrhenius%20acids) are named {{according to their [anions](ion.md)}}. In the classical naming system, {{the anion is named as if it were an [cation](ion.md) and then appended _acid_}}. If the anion is a simple ion, {{the anion is prefixed with _hydro-_ and suffixed with _-ic acid_}}. <!--SR:!2023-08-18,96,290!2024-01-10,199,270!2023-12-29,185,250-->

In the [IUPAC](International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry.md) naming system, {{_aqueous_ is added before the name of the [ionic compound](ionic%20compound.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-12-16,162,250-->

## characteristics

### monoprotic acids

Monoprotic acids, also called {{monobasic acids}}, are {{acids that can donate one [proton](proton.md) per [molecule](molecule.md) during [dissociation](dissociation%20(chemistry).md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-02-05,243,330!2023-09-28,135,290-->

### polyprotic acids

Polyprotic acids, also called {{polybasic acids}}, are {{acids that can donate multiple [protons](proton.md) per [molecule](molecule.md) during [dissociation](dissociation%20(chemistry).md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-03-01,263,330!2024-04-03,260,270-->
