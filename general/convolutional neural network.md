# convolutional neural network

A __convolutional neural network__ (__CNN__) is {{a [regularized](regularization%20(mathematics).md) type of [feedforward neural network](feedforward%20neural%20network.md) that learns [feature engineering](feature%20engineering.md) via [filters](filter%20(signal%20processing).md) or kernels optimization}}. The filters {{combine several pixels into one, regularizing weights with fewer connections to the subsequent neurons}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-21,162,310!2024-11-18,102,290-->

An CNN exhibits {{spatial [dynamic behavior](dynamical%20system.md)}}. This makes it suitable for datasets {{with spatial relationship between the samples, such as images}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-01,60,310!2024-09-05,63,310-->
