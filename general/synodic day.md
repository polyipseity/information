# synodic day

A __synodic day__ (or __synodic rotation period__ or __solar day__) is {{the [period](rotation%20period.md) for a [celestial object](astronomical%20object.md) to rotate once in relation to the [star](star.md) it is [orbiting](orbit.md)}}, and is the basis of {{[solar time](solar%20time.md)}}. As of 2008, a mean solar day for [Earth](Earth.md) is {{about 86&nbsp;400.002 SI seconds, i.e., about 24.000&nbsp;0006 hours}}. <!--SR:!2025-07-06,287,330!2025-07-14,293,330!2025-04-22,187,270-->

The synodic day is distinguished from {{the sidereal day, which is one complete rotation in relation to [distant stars](fixed%20stars.md)}} and is the basis of {{[sidereal time](sidereal%20time.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-05-15,243,330!2025-03-17,196,310-->

In the case of {{a [tidally locked](tidal%20locking.md) [planet](planet.md), the same side always faces its parent star}}, and its synodic day is {{infinite. Its sidereal day, however, equals its [orbital period](orbital%20period.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-02,182,310!2025-08-08,312,330-->
