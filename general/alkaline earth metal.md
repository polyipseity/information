# alkaline earth metal

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../tools/utility.py.md
```

The __alkaline earth metals__ {@{consist of the [chemical elements](chemical%20element.md) [beryllium](beryllium.md) (Be), [magnesium](magnesium.md) (Mg), [calcium](calcium.md) (Ca), [strontium](strontium.md) (Sr), [barium](barium.md) (Ba), and [radium](radium.md) (Ra)}@}. The alkaline earth metals are {@{all relatively-low-[density](density.md), and somewhat [reactive](reactivity%20(chemistry).md)}@}.

## representative reactions

Alkaline earth metals {@{can form [ionic compounds](ionic%20compound.md) with [nonmetals](nonmetal.md)}@}.

### reaction with water

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
ca_or_below = 'reacts with cold water to form [hydroxide](hydroxide.md) and [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) gas; more vigorous than elements above'
return await memorize_map(
  __env__.cwf_sects('0439', '1d5e', 'ffa2'),
  items_to_map(
    ('[beryllium](beryllium.md)', 'no reaction with water or steam',),
    ('[magnesium](magnesium.md)', 'reacts with steam to form [hydroxide](hydroxide.md) and [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) gas',),
    ('[calcium](calcium.md)', ca_or_below,),
    ('[strontium](strontium.md)', ca_or_below,),
    ('[barium](barium.md)', ca_or_below,),
    ('[radium](radium.md)', 'unknown',),
  ),
)
