# chart of accounts

A __chart of accounts__ (__COA__) is {@{a list of financial [accounts](account%20(bookkeeping).md) and reference numbers, grouped into categories}@}, such as {@{assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses, and used for recording transactions in the organization's [general ledger](general%20ledger.md)}@}. Accounts may be associated with {@{an identifier (account number) and a caption or header and are coded by account type}@}. In {@{computerized [accounting systems](accounting%20software.md) with computable quantity accounting}@}, the accounts can {@{have a quantity measure definition}@}. Account numbers may consist of {@{numerical, alphabetic, or [alpha-numeric](alphanumericals.md) characters}@}, although in {@{many computerized environments, like the [SIE format](SIE%20(file%20format).md), only numerical identifiers are allowed}@}. {@{The structure and headings of accounts}@} should {@{assist in consistent posting of transactions}@}. Each nominal ledger account is {@{unique, which allows its [ledger](ledger.md) to be located}@}. The accounts are typically arranged in {@{the order of the customary appearance of accounts in the financial statements}@}: {@{balance sheet accounts followed by profit and loss accounts}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-11,64,310!2025-01-27,95,270!2024-12-11,64,310!2024-12-12,65,310!2024-12-15,66,310!2024-12-17,68,310!2025-03-16,133,290!2024-11-15,43,290!2024-11-30,53,310!2024-11-27,50,310!2024-12-16,67,310!2025-05-07,175,310-->

The charts of accounts can be {@{picked from a standard chart of accounts, like the BAS in Sweden}@}. In some countries, charts of accounts are {@{defined by the accountant from a standard general layouts or as regulated by law}@}. However, in most countries {@{it is entirely up to each accountant to design the chart of accounts}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-13,66,310!2024-12-09,62,310!2024-11-19,42,290-->
