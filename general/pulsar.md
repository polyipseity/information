# pulsar

A __pulsar__ (from {{_<b>pulsa</b>ting <b>r</b>adio source_}}) is {{a highly magnetized rotating [neutron star](neutron%20star.md) that emits beams of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) out of its [magnetic poles](poles%20of%20astronomical%20bodies.md#magnetic%20poles)}}. This radiation can be observed {{only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth (similar to the way a [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer)}}, and is responsible for {{the pulsed appearance of emission}}. Neutron stars are {{very [dense](density.md) and have short, regular rotational [periods](frequency.md)}}. This produces {{a very precise interval between pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar}}. Pulsars are one of the candidates for {{the source of [ultra-high-energy cosmic rays](ultra-high-energy%20cosmic%20ray.md)}}. (See also [centrifugal mechanism of acceleration](centrifugal%20acceleration%20(astrophysics).md).) <!--SR:!2024-08-23,15,290!2024-08-20,12,270!2024-09-08,22,270!2024-08-20,12,270!2024-08-23,15,290!2024-08-21,13,290!2024-09-27,40,290-->
