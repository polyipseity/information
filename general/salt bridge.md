# salt bridge

__Salt bridge__ is {@{a device connecting the two [half-cells](half-cell.md) of a [galvanic cell](galvanic%20cell.md)}@}. It {@{maintains electrical neutrality in the internal circuit}@}. It comes in two main types: {@{glass tubes and [filter paper](filter%20paper.md), both soaked with a relatively [inert](chemically%20inert.md) [electrolyte](electrolyte.md)}@}.

The inert electrolyte is usually {@{a combination of [potassium](potassium.md) or [ammonium](ammonium.md) [cations](ion.md) and [chloride](chloride.md) or [nitrate](nitrate.md) [anions](ion.md)}@}, chosen such that {@{it does not react with other chemicals used in the cell}@}.
