# interacting galaxy

## galactic cannibalism

{{__Galactic cannibalism__}} is {{a common phenomenon}}. It refers to {{the process in which a large [galaxy](galaxy.md), through [tidal](galactic%20tide.md) gravitational interactions with a companion, merges with that companion}}. The most common result of the gravitational merger between two or more galaxies is {{a larger [irregular galaxy](irregular%20galaxy.md), but [elliptical galaxies](elliptical%20galaxy.md) may also result}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-20,3,250!2024-08-21,4,270-->

It has been suggested that galactic cannibalism is {{currently occurring between the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md) and the [Large and Small Magellanic Clouds](Magellanic%20Clouds.md)}}. {{Streams of gravitationally-attracted [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) arcing from these dwarf galaxies to the Milky Way}} is taken as evidence for the theory. <!--SR:!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270-->
