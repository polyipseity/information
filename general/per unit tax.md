# per unit tax

{@{A __per unit tax__, or __specific tax__}@}, is {@{a [tax](tax.md) that is defined as a fixed amount for each unit of a good or service sold}@}, such as {@{cents per kilogram}@}. It is thus {@{proportional to the particular quantity of a product sold, regardless of its price}@}. {@{[Excise](excise.md) taxes}@}, for instance, fall into this tax category. By contrast, {@{an [ad valorem](ad%20valorem%20tax.md) tax}@} is {@{a charge based on a fixed percentage of the product value}@}. Per unit taxes have {@{administrative advantages when it is easy to measure quantities of the product or service being sold}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-06,65,310!2025-01-28,58,310!2025-02-04,63,310!2025-02-05,64,310!2025-01-11,41,290!2025-02-01,60,310!2025-01-28,58,310!2025-01-28,58,310-->

## effect on supply curve

Any tax will {@{raise cost of production hence shift the supply curve to the left}@}. In {@{the case of specific tax}@}, the shift will be {@{purely parallel because the amount of tax is the same at all prices}@}. That amount is illustrated in {@{the distance between the supply curve with taxation and the one without taxation}@}. Specific tax are {@{indirect tax}@}. This will {@{raise the supply curve vertically by the amount of the tax}@}, and new curve will {@{be parallel to the original curve}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-07,66,310!2025-02-03,62,310!2025-02-07,66,310!2025-02-08,67,310!2025-01-31,59,310!2025-01-30,58,310!2025-01-28,58,310-->

## tobacco taxation

The term specific tax is {@{mostly connected to tobacco taxation}@}. Using specific taxes has proved to be {@{one of the most effective ways to reduce consumption}@}, whereas {@{ad valorem tax which is based on a per cent of product value may lead to substitution to cheaper brands}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-08,67,310!2025-01-12,42,290!2025-01-29,57,310-->
