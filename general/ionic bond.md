# ionic bond

__Ionic bonding__ is {{a type of [chemical bonding](chemical%20bond.md) involving the [electrostatic attraction](Coulomb's%20law.md) between oppositely charged [ions](ion.md) or [atoms](atom.md) with greatly differing [electronegativity](electronegativity.md)}}. It is the primary interaction in {{[ionic compounds](ionic%20compound.md)}}. {{A transfer of [electrons](electron.md)}} takes place, which is also known as {{__electrovalence__ in contrast to [covalence](covalent%20bond.md)}}. Atoms that {{gain electrons become [anions](ion.md) while those that lose electrons become [cations](ion.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-11-09,94,190!2024-02-21,247,330!2024-03-15,269,330!2024-01-13,216,310!2024-05-13,316,330-->
