# gravitational lens

A __gravitational lens__ is {{matter, such as a [cluster of galaxies](galaxy%20cluster.md) or a [point particle](point%20particle.md), that bends light from a distant source as it travels toward an observer}}. The amount of __gravitational lensing__ is described by {{[Albert Einstein](Albert%20Einstein.md)'s [general theory of relativity](general%20relativity.md)}}. If light is {{treated as [corpuscles](corpuscular%20theory%20of%20light.md) travelling at the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md)}}, [Newtonian physics](classical%20mechanics.md) also {{predicts the bending of light, but only half of that predicted by general relativity}}.
