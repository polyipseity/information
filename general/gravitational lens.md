# gravitational lens

A __gravitational lens__ is {@{matter, such as a [cluster of galaxies](galaxy%20cluster.md) or a [point particle](point%20particle.md), that bends light from a distant source as it travels toward an observer}@}. The amount of __gravitational lensing__ is described by {@{[Albert Einstein](Albert%20Einstein.md)'s [general theory of relativity](general%20relativity.md)}@}. If light is {@{treated as [corpuscles](corpuscular%20theory%20of%20light.md) travelling at the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md)}@}, [Newtonian physics](classical%20mechanics.md) also {@{predicts the bending of light, but only half of that predicted by general relativity}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-26,251,330!2025-08-05,283,330!2025-01-24,123,290!2025-05-02,199,310-->
