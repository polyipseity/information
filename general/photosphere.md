# photosphere

The __photosphere__ is {{a [star](star.md)'s outer shell from which [light](light.md) is radiated}}. It {{extends into a star's surface until the [plasma](plasma%20(physics).md) becomes opaque, equivalent to an [optical depth](optical%20depth.md) of $-\ln(1 / 2) \approx 0.693$, or equivalently, a depth from which 50% of light will escape without being scattered}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-11,15,290!2024-08-05,9,270-->

The [absorption spectrum](absorption%20spectroscopy.md#absorption%20spectrum) of a [star](star.md) is {{produced when light emitted by the star is absorbed by gases in the photosphere}}. It tells us {{about the composition of the photosphere and its [ionization state](ionization.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-07,11,270!2024-08-12,16,290-->
