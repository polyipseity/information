# galaxy formation and evolution

## commonly observed properties of galaxies

Because of {{the inability to conduct experiments in outer space}}, {{the only way to "test" theories and models of galaxy evolution is to compare them with observations}}. Explanations for how galaxies formed and evolved must be {{able to predict the observed properties and types of galaxies}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-10,40,290!2024-09-05,14,290!2024-09-08,17,290-->

[Edwin Hubble](Edwin%20Hubble.md) {{created an early galaxy classification scheme, now known as the Hubble tuning-fork diagram}}. It {{partitioned galaxies into [ellipticals](elliptical%20galaxy.md), normal [spirals](spiral%20galaxy.md), [barred spirals](barred%20spiral%20galaxy.md) (such as the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md)), and [irregulars](irregular%20galaxy.md)}}. These galaxy types {{exhibit the following properties which can be explained by current galaxy evolution theories}}: <!--SR:!2024-09-30,32,270!2024-09-30,30,270!2024-09-06,15,290-->

- {{Many of the properties of galaxies (including the [galaxy color–magnitude diagram](galaxy%20color–magnitude%20diagram.md))}} indicate that {{there are fundamentally two types of galaxies}}. These groups divide into {{blue star-forming galaxies that are more like spiral types}}, and {{red non-star forming galaxies that are more like elliptical galaxies}}.
- Spiral galaxies are {{quite thin, dense, and rotate relatively fast}}, while {{the stars in elliptical galaxies have randomly oriented orbits}}.
- The majority of giant galaxies contain {{a [supermassive black hole](supermassive%20black%20hole.md) in their centers, ranging in mass from millions to billions of times the mass of the [Sun](Sun.md)}}. The black hole mass is {{tied to the host galaxy bulge or spheroid mass}}.
- {{[Metallicity](metallicity.md)}} has {{a positive correlation with the luminosity (negative correlation with the [absolute magnitude](absolute%20magnitude.md)) of a galaxy}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-07,16,290!2024-09-02,13,270!2024-10-03,35,270!2024-09-19,23,270!2024-10-03,34,270!2024-09-13,17,250!2024-09-06,15,290!2024-09-04,13,290!2024-10-07,37,290!2024-09-08,17,290-->

Astronomers now believe that {{disk galaxies likely formed first}}, then {{evolved into elliptical galaxies through galaxy mergers}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-05,14,290!2024-09-01,10,270-->

Current models also predict that {{the majority of mass in galaxies is made up of [dark matter](dark%20matter.md), a substance which is not directly observable, and might not interact through any means except gravity}}. This observation arises because {{galaxies could not have formed as they have, or rotate as they are seen to, unless they contain far more mass than can be directly observed}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-04,13,290!2024-09-24,26,270-->
