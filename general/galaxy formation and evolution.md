# galaxy formation and evolution

## commonly observed properties of galaxies

Because of {@{the inability to conduct experiments in outer space}@}, {@{the only way to "test" theories and models of galaxy evolution is to compare them with observations}@}. Explanations for how galaxies formed and evolved must be {@{able to predict the observed properties and types of galaxies}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,159,310!2025-06-24,238,330!2025-08-27,287,330-->

[Edwin Hubble](Edwin%20Hubble.md) {@{created an early galaxy classification scheme, now known as the Hubble tuning-fork diagram}@}. It {@{partitioned galaxies into [ellipticals](elliptical%20galaxy.md), normal [spirals](spiral%20galaxy.md), [barred spirals](barred%20spiral%20galaxy.md) (such as the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md)), and [irregulars](irregular%20galaxy.md)}@}. These galaxy types {@{exhibit the following properties which can be explained by current galaxy evolution theories}@}: <!--SR:!2025-01-28,120,290!2025-01-20,112,290!2025-08-17,281,330-->

- {@{Many of the properties of galaxies (including the [galaxy color–magnitude diagram](galaxy%20color–magnitude%20diagram.md))}@} indicate that {@{there are fundamentally two types of galaxies}@}. These groups divide into {@{blue star-forming galaxies that are more like spiral types}@}, and {@{red non-star forming galaxies that are more like elliptical galaxies}@}.
- Spiral galaxies are {@{quite thin, dense, and rotate relatively fast}@}, while {@{the stars in elliptical galaxies have randomly oriented orbits}@}.
- The majority of giant galaxies contain {@{a [supermassive black hole](supermassive%20black%20hole.md) in their centers, ranging in mass from millions to billions of times the mass of the [Sun](Sun.md)}@}. The black hole mass is {@{tied to the host galaxy bulge or spheroid mass}@}.
- {@{[Metallicity](metallicity.md)}@} has {@{a positive correlation with the luminosity (negative correlation with the [absolute magnitude](absolute%20magnitude.md)) of a galaxy}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-19,192,310!2025-05-22,212,310!2025-01-02,91,270!2025-09-04,261,290!2025-02-05,125,290!2025-02-12,108,250!2025-07-19,257,330!2025-06-06,224,330!2025-03-03,146,310!2025-06-15,213,310-->

Astronomers now believe that {@{disk galaxies likely formed first}@}, then {@{evolved into elliptical galaxies through galaxy mergers}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-22,237,330!2025-01-16,108,290-->

Current models also predict that {@{the majority of mass in galaxies is made up of [dark matter](dark%20matter.md), a substance which is not directly observable, and might not interact through any means except gravity}@}. This observation arises because {@{galaxies could not have formed as they have, or rotate as they are seen to, unless they contain far more mass than can be directly observed}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-06,113,290!2024-12-30,97,290-->
