# main sequence turnoff

The __turnoff point__ for a [star](star.md) refers to {{the point on the [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md) where it leaves the main sequence after its main fuel is exhausted – the __main sequence turnoff__}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-11,15,290-->

By {{plotting the turnoff points of individual [stars](star.md)}} in a [star cluster](star%20cluster.md) one can {{[estimate the cluster's age](main%20sequence.md#evolutionary%20tracks.md)}}. The graph would look like {{a diagonal candle burning from top-left to bottom-right, with subgiant stars starting to shift top-right (looking like the smoke; initially there is no smoke as no stars are dying) over (extremely long) time}}. The turnoff point for the cluster is {{the topmost star that has not yet shifted top-right from the main sequence strip at all}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-13,17,290!2024-08-10,14,290!2024-08-06,10,270!2024-08-12,16,290-->
