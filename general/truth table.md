# truth table

A __truth table__ is {{a [mathematical table](mathematical%20table.md) used in [logic](logic.md)}}—specifically in connection with {{[Boolean algebra](boolean%20algebra.md), [Boolean functions](boolean%20function.md), and [propositional calculus](propositional%20calculus.md)}}—which {{sets out the functional values of logical [expressions](expression%20(mathematics).md) on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each [combination of values taken by their logical variables](valuation%20(logic).md)}}. In particular, truth tables can be used to show {{whether a propositional expression is true for all legitimate input values, that is, [logically valid](validity%20(logic).md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-29,60,310!2024-11-14,45,290!2024-12-20,65,270!2024-12-01,62,310-->

A truth table has {{one column for each input variable (for example, A and B), and one final column showing all of the possible results of the logical operation that the table represents (for example, [A](#exclusive%20disjunction) [XOR](exclusive%20or.md) [B](#exclusive%20disjunction))}}. Each row of the truth table contains {{one possible configuration of the input variables (for instance, A=true, B=false), and the result of the operation for those values}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-15,90,290!2025-04-27,172,310-->

A truth table is {{a structured representation that presents all possible combinations of truth values for the input variables of a Boolean function and their corresponding output values}}. A [function](function%20(mathematics).md) _f_ from A to F is {{a special [relation](relation%20(mathematics).md), a subset of A×F}}, which simply means that {{_f_ can be listed as a list of input-output pairs}}. Clearly, for the Boolean functions, the output {{belongs to a binary set, i.e. F = {0, 1}<!-- flashcard separator -->}}. For {{an n-ary Boolean function}}, the inputs come from {{a domain that is itself a [Cartesian](cartesian%20product.md) product of binary sets corresponding to the input Boolean variables}}. For example for a binary function, _f_(A, B), the domain of _f_ is {{A×B, which can be listed as: A×B = {(A = 0, B = 0), (A = 0, B = 1), (A = 1, B = 0), (A = 1, B = 1)}<!-- flashcard separator -->}}. Each element in the domain represents {{a combination of input values for the variables A and B}}. These combinations now can be {{combined with the output of the function corresponding to that combination, thus forming the set of input-output pairs as a special relation that is a subset of A×F}}. For {{a relation to be a function}}, the special requirement is that {{each element of the domain of the function must be mapped to one and only one member of the codomain}}. Thus, the function f itself can be listed as: {{_f_ = {((0, 0), _f_<sub>0</sub>), ((0, 1), _f_<sub>1</sub>), ((1, 0), _f_<sub>2</sub>), ((1, 1), _f_<sub>3</sub>)}<!-- flashcard separator -->}}, where _f_<sub>0</sub>, _f_<sub>1</sub>, _f_<sub>2</sub>, and _f_<sub>3</sub> are each {{Boolean, 0 or 1, values as members of the codomain {0, 1}<!-- flashcard separator -->}}, as {{the outputs corresponding to the member of the domain, respectively}}. Rather than {{a list (set) given above}}, the truth table then {{presents these input-output pairs in a tabular format, in which each row corresponds to a member of the domain paired with its corresponding output value, 0 or 1}}. Of course, for the Boolean functions, we do not have to {{list all the members of the [domain](domain%20of%20a%20function.md) with their [images](image%20(mathematics).md) in the [codomain](codomain.md)}}; we can simply {{list the mappings that map the member to "1", because all the others will have to be mapped to "0" automatically (that leads us to the [minterms](canonical%20normal%20form.md#minterms) idea)}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-10,135,310!2024-11-25,57,310!2024-11-30,62,310!2024-11-09,46,290!2025-03-29,151,310!2024-11-29,60,310!2024-12-08,68,310!2024-11-30,61,310!2024-11-24,56,310!2024-11-26,58,310!2024-11-24,56,310!2024-12-03,64,310!2024-11-28,60,310!2024-11-29,61,310!2024-11-30,61,310!2025-04-29,173,310!2024-11-27,59,310!2024-12-01,63,310-->

{{[Ludwig Wittgenstein](Ludwig%20Wittgenstein.md)}} is generally credited with {{inventing and popularizing the truth table in his _[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus](Tractatus%20Logico-Philosophicus.md)_, which was completed in 1918 and published in 1921}}. Such a system was also {{independently proposed in 1921 by [Emil Leon Post](Emil%20Leon%20Post.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-02,78,270!2025-04-20,169,310!2025-03-03,121,290-->
