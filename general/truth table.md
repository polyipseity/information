# truth table

A __truth table__ is {@{a [mathematical table](mathematical%20table.md) used in [logic](logic.md)}@}—specifically in connection with {@{[Boolean algebra](boolean%20algebra.md), [Boolean functions](boolean%20function.md), and [propositional calculus](propositional%20calculus.md)}@}—which {@{sets out the functional values of logical [expressions](expression%20(mathematics).md) on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each [combination of values taken by their logical variables](valuation%20(logic).md)}@}. In particular, truth tables can be used to show {@{whether a propositional expression is true for all legitimate input values, that is, [logically valid](validity%20(logic).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-17,260,330!2025-05-15,182,310!2024-12-20,65,270!2025-06-13,194,310-->

A truth table has {@{one column for each input variable (for example, A and B), and one final column showing all of the possible results of the logical operation that the table represents (for example, [A](#exclusive%20disjunction) [XOR](exclusive%20or.md) [B](#exclusive%20disjunction))}@}. Each row of the truth table contains {@{one possible configuration of the input variables (for instance, A=true, B=false), and the result of the operation for those values}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-15,90,290!2025-04-27,172,310-->

A truth table is {@{a structured representation that presents all possible combinations of truth values for the input variables of a Boolean function and their corresponding output values}@}. A [function](function%20(mathematics).md) _f_ from A to F is {@{a special [relation](relation%20(mathematics).md), a subset of A×F}@}, which simply means that {@{_f_ can be listed as a list of input-output pairs}@}. Clearly, for the Boolean functions, the output {@{belongs to a binary set, i.e. F = {0, 1}<!-- flashcard separator -->}@}. For {@{an n-ary Boolean function}@}, the inputs come from {@{a domain that is itself a [Cartesian](cartesian%20product.md) product of binary sets corresponding to the input Boolean variables}@}. For example for a binary function, _f_(A, B), the domain of _f_ is {@{A×B, which can be listed as: A×B = {(A = 0, B = 0), (A = 0, B = 1), (A = 1, B = 0), (A = 1, B = 1)}<!-- flashcard separator -->}@}. Each element in the domain represents {@{a combination of input values for the variables A and B}@}. These combinations now can be {@{combined with the output of the function corresponding to that combination, thus forming the set of input-output pairs as a special relation that is a subset of A×F}@}. For {@{a relation to be a function}@}, the special requirement is that {@{each element of the domain of the function must be mapped to one and only one member of the codomain}@}. Thus, the function f itself can be listed as: {@{_f_ = {((0, 0), _f_<sub>0</sub>), ((0, 1), _f_<sub>1</sub>), ((1, 0), _f_<sub>2</sub>), ((1, 1), _f_<sub>3</sub>)}<!-- flashcard separator -->}@}, where _f_<sub>0</sub>, _f_<sub>1</sub>, _f_<sub>2</sub>, and _f_<sub>3</sub> are each {@{Boolean, 0 or 1, values as members of the codomain {0, 1}<!-- flashcard separator -->}@}, as {@{the outputs corresponding to the member of the domain, respectively}@}. Rather than {@{a list (set) given above}@}, the truth table then {@{presents these input-output pairs in a tabular format, in which each row corresponds to a member of the domain paired with its corresponding output value, 0 or 1}@}. Of course, for the Boolean functions, we do not have to {@{list all the members of the [domain](domain%20of%20a%20function.md) with their [images](image%20(mathematics).md) in the [codomain](codomain.md)}@}; we can simply {@{list the mappings that map the member to "1", because all the others will have to be mapped to "0" automatically (that leads us to the [minterms](canonical%20normal%20form.md#minterms) idea)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-10,135,310!2025-08-01,249,330!2025-08-29,272,330!2025-05-17,189,310!2025-03-29,151,310!2025-08-18,261,330!2025-10-01,297,330!2025-08-24,267,330!2025-07-21,239,330!2025-08-08,255,330!2025-07-22,240,330!2025-09-09,280,330!2025-08-18,263,330!2025-08-24,267,330!2025-08-25,268,330!2025-04-29,173,310!2025-08-13,259,330!2025-09-03,276,330-->

{@{[Ludwig Wittgenstein](Ludwig%20Wittgenstein.md)}@} is generally credited with {@{inventing and popularizing the truth table in his _[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus](Tractatus%20Logico-Philosophicus.md)_, which was completed in 1918 and published in 1921}@}. Such a system was also {@{independently proposed in 1921 by [Emil Leon Post](Emil%20Leon%20Post.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-02,78,270!2025-04-20,169,310!2025-03-03,121,290-->
