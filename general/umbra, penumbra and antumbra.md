# umbra, penumbra and antumbra

The {@{__umbra__, __penumbra__ and __antumbra__}@} are {@{three distinct parts of a [shadow](shadow.md), created by any light source after impinging on an [opaque](opacity.md) object}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-19,290,330!2025-07-17,287,330-->

## umbra

The {@{__umbra__}@} ([Latin](Latin.md) for {@{"shadow"}@}) is {@{the innermost and darkest part of a [shadow](shadow.md), where the light source is completely blocked by the occluding body}@}. An observer within the umbra experiences {@{a [total eclipse](solar%20eclipse.md#total%20eclipse)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-08,234,330!2025-04-12,214,330!2025-09-10,307,290!2025-02-15,157,310-->

The umbra of a round body occluding a round light source forms {@{a right circular [cone](cone.md)}@}. When viewed from the cone's [apex](apex%20(geometry).md), {@{the two bodies [appear the same size](angular%20diameter.md)}@}. The cone can be visualized by {@{drawing two lines, one from the light source top to the round body top, the other from the light source bottom to the round body bottom}@}. Then the cone is {@{the portion enclosed by the two lines and behind the round body}@}. If the round body is {@{larger than the round light source}@}, then {@{the umbra is a [frustum](frustum.md) instead}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-23,182,310!2025-01-19,148,310!2025-01-28,141,290!2025-02-03,156,310!2025-01-05,131,290!2025-02-26,176,310-->

The [distance](lunar%20distance.md) from the [Moon](Moon.md) to the [apex](apex%20(geometry).md) of its umbra is {@{roughly equal to that between the Moon and [Earth](Earth.md): 384&nbsp;402 km (238&nbsp;856 mi)}@}. Since {@{Earth's [diameter](diameter.md) is 3.7 times the Moon's}@}, its umbra {@{extends correspondingly farther: roughly 1.4 million km (870&nbsp;000 mi)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-01,109,250!2025-03-20,178,310!2024-12-19,96,250-->

## penumbra

The {@{__penumbra__}@} (from the [Latin](Latin.md) {@{_paene_ "almost, nearly" and _umbra_ "shadow"}@}) is {@{the region in which only a portion of the light source is obscured by the [occluding](occultation.md) body}@}. An observer in the penumbra experiences {@{a [partial eclipse](solar%20eclipse.md#partial%20eclipse)}@}. An alternative definition is {@{that the penumbra is the region where _some_ or _all_ of the light source is obscured (i.e., the [umbra](#umbra) is a subset of the penumbra)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-07,256,330!2026-03-04,451,310!2025-05-29,233,290!2025-11-26,372,310!2024-12-19,112,290-->

The penumbra of a round body occluding a round light source forms {@{a [frustum](frustum.md) subtracted by the [umbra](#umbra) [cone](cone.md)}@}. The shape can be visualized by {@{drawing two lines, one from the light source top to the round body bottom, the other from the light source bottom to the round body top}@}. Then the frustum is {@{the portion enclosed by the two lines and behind the round body, minus the umbra cone}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-21,134,270!2025-09-01,304,290!2025-07-16,274,290-->

## antumbra

The {@{__antumbra__}@} (from the [Latin](Latin.md) {@{_ante_ "before" and _umbra_ "shadow"}@}) is {@{the region from which the [occluding](occultation.md) body appears entirely within the disc of the light source}@}. This implies {@{the antumbra is a subset of the [penumbra](#penumbra)}@}. An observer in this region experiences {@{an [annular eclipse](solar%20eclipse.md#annular%20eclipse), in which a bright ring is visible around the eclipsing body}@}. If the observer moves closer to the light source, {@{the [apparent size](angular%20diameter.md) of the occluding body increases until it causes a full [umbra](#umbra)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-06,209,330!2025-01-14,144,310!2025-02-08,154,290!2025-02-09,164,310!2025-06-25,253,290!2025-01-12,138,310-->

The antumbra of a round body occluding a round light source forms {@{a [cone](cone.md)}@}. The cone can be visualized by {@{drawing two lines, one from the light source top to the round body top, the other from the light source bottom to the round body bottom}@}. Then the cone is {@{the portion enclosed by the two lines and behind the apex of the [umbra](#umbra) cone}@}. If the round body is {@{larger than or equal to the round light source in actual size}@}, then {@{there is no antumbra}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-04,231,330!2026-01-17,418,310!2025-02-01,129,250!2025-03-14,188,310!2026-05-14,513,330-->
