# umbra, penumbra and antumbra

The {{__umbra__, __penumbra__ and __antumbra__}} are {{three distinct parts of a [shadow](shadow.md), created by any light source after impinging on an [opaque](opacity.md) object}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-02,67,310!2024-10-03,68,310-->

## umbra

The {{__umbra__}} ([Latin](Latin.md) for {{"shadow"}}) is {{the innermost and darkest part of a [shadow](shadow.md), where the light source is completely blocked by the occluding body}}. An observer within the umbra experiences {{a [total eclipse](solar%20eclipse.md#total%20eclipse)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-16,55,310!2024-09-10,50,310!2024-08-18,30,270!2024-09-11,51,310-->

The umbra of a round body occluding a round light source forms {{a right circular [cone](cone.md)}}. When viewed from the cone's [apex](apex%20(geometry).md), {{the two bodies [appear the same size](angular%20diameter.md)}}. The cone can be visualized by {{drawing two lines, one from the light source top to the round body top, the other from the light source bottom to the round body bottom}}. Then the cone is {{the portion enclosed by the two lines and behind the round body}}. If the round body is {{larger than the round light source}}, then {{the umbra is a [frustum](frustum.md) instead}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,59,310!2024-08-24,37,290!2024-09-08,49,290!2024-08-31,39,290!2024-08-25,35,270!2024-09-03,44,290-->

The [distance](lunar%20distance.md) from the [Moon](Moon.md) to the [apex](apex%20(geometry).md) of its umbra is {{roughly equal to that between the Moon and [Earth](Earth.md): 384&nbsp;402 km (238&nbsp;856 mi)}}. Since {{Earth's [diameter](diameter.md) is 3.7 times the Moon's}}, its umbra {{extends correspondingly farther: roughly 1.4 million km (870&nbsp;000 mi)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-13,43,250!2024-09-23,58,310!2024-09-13,40,250-->

## penumbra

The {{__penumbra__}} (from the [Latin](Latin.md) {{_paene_ "almost, nearly" and _umbra_ "shadow"}}) is {{the region in which only a portion of the light source is obscured by the [occluding](occultation.md) body}}. An observer in the penumbra experiences {{a [partial eclipse](solar%20eclipse.md#partial%20eclipse)}}. An alternative definition is {{that the penumbra is the region where _some_ or _all_ of the light source is obscured (i.e., the [umbra](#umbra) is a subset of the penumbra)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-24,59,310!2024-08-19,29,270!2024-10-04,62,270!2024-08-19,32,290!2024-08-29,39,290-->

The penumbra of a round body occluding a round light source forms {{a [frustum](frustum.md) subtracted by the [umbra](#umbra) [cone](cone.md)}}. The shape can be visualized by {{drawing two lines, one from the light source top to the round body bottom, the other from the light source bottom to the round body top}}. Then the frustum is {{the portion enclosed by the two lines and behind the round body, minus the umbra cone}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-09,39,250!2024-08-16,29,270!2024-10-14,71,270-->

## antumbra

The {{__antumbra__}} (from the [Latin](Latin.md) {{_ante_ "before" and _umbra_ "shadow"}}) is {{the region from which the [occluding](occultation.md) body appears entirely within the disc of the light source}}. This implies {{the antumbra is a subset of the [penumbra](#penumbra)}}. An observer in this region experiences {{an [annular eclipse](solar%20eclipse.md#annular%20eclipse), in which a bright ring is visible around the eclipsing body}}. If the observer moves closer to the light source, {{the [apparent size](angular%20diameter.md) of the occluding body increases until it causes a full [umbra](#umbra)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-09,49,310!2024-08-23,36,290!2024-09-06,41,270!2024-08-29,41,290!2024-10-13,64,270!2024-08-25,34,290-->

The antumbra of a round body occluding a round light source forms {{a [cone](cone.md)}}. The cone can be visualized by {{drawing two lines, one from the light source top to the round body top, the other from the light source bottom to the round body bottom}}. Then the cone is {{the portion enclosed by the two lines and behind the apex of the [umbra](#umbra) cone}}. If the round body is {{larger than or equal to the round light source in actual size}}, then {{there is no antumbra}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-15,54,310!2024-11-25,103,290!2024-09-25,52,250!2024-09-06,47,290!2024-08-17,30,290-->
