# degenerate matter

__Degenerate matter__ occurs when {@{the [Pauli exclusion principle](Pauli%20exclusion%20principle.md) significantly alters a [state of matter](state%20of%20matter.md) at low [temperature](temperature.md)}@}. The term is used in [astrophysics](astrophysics.md) to {@{refer to dense stellar objects such as [white dwarfs](white%20dwarf.md) and [neutron stars](neutron%20star.md), where thermal pressure alone is not enough to avoid [gravitational collapse](gravitational%20collapse.md)}@}. The term also applies to {@{metals in the [Fermi gas](fermi%20gas.md) approximation}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,169,312!2025-03-15,168,310!2024-12-02,89,292-->

Degenerate matter is usually modelled as {@{an ideal [Fermi gas](fermi%20gas.md), an ensemble of non-interacting fermions}@}. In a quantum mechanical description, particles {@{limited to a finite volume may take only a discrete set of energies, called [quantum states](quantum%20state.md)}@}. The [Pauli exclusion principle](Pauli%20exclusion%20principle.md) prevents {@{identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state}@}. At {@{lowest total energy (when the thermal energy of the particles is negligible)}@}, all {@{the lowest energy quantum states are filled. This state is referred to as full degeneracy}@}. This __degeneracy pressure__ remains {@{non-zero even at absolute zero temperature}@}. Adding particles or reducing the volume {@{forces the particles into higher-energy quantum states}@}. In this situation, {@{a compression force is required, and is made manifest as a resisting pressure}@}. The key feature is that {@{this degeneracy pressure does not depend on the temperature but only on the density of the fermions}@}. Degeneracy pressure keeps {@{dense stars in equilibrium, independent of the thermal structure of the star}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-14,188,312!2025-02-16,136,292!2025-07-23,275,332!2024-12-29,103,292!2025-05-04,206,312!2025-03-24,177,312!2025-03-28,177,312!2025-07-10,248,290!2025-08-04,287,332!2025-08-31,307,332-->
