# degenerate matter

__Degenerate matter__ occurs when {{the [Pauli exclusion principle](Pauli%20exclusion%20principle.md) significantly alters a [state of matter](state%20of%20matter.md) at low [temperature](temperature.md)}}. The term is used in [astrophysics](astrophysics.md) to {{refer to dense stellar objects such as [white dwarfs](white%20dwarf.md) and [neutron stars](neutron%20star.md), where thermal pressure alone is not enough to avoid [gravitational collapse](gravitational%20collapse.md)}}. The term also applies to {{metals in the [Fermi gas](fermi%20gas.md) approximation}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,169,312!2025-03-15,168,310!2024-12-02,89,292-->

Degenerate matter is usually modelled as {{an ideal [Fermi gas](fermi%20gas.md), an ensemble of non-interacting fermions}}. In a quantum mechanical description, particles {{limited to a finite volume may take only a discrete set of energies, called [quantum states](quantum%20state.md)}}. The [Pauli exclusion principle](Pauli%20exclusion%20principle.md) prevents {{identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state}}. At {{lowest total energy (when the thermal energy of the particles is negligible)}}, all {{the lowest energy quantum states are filled. This state is referred to as full degeneracy}}. This __degeneracy pressure__ remains {{non-zero even at absolute zero temperature}}. Adding particles or reducing the volume {{forces the particles into higher-energy quantum states}}. In this situation, {{a compression force is required, and is made manifest as a resisting pressure}}. The key feature is that {{this degeneracy pressure does not depend on the temperature but only on the density of the fermions}}. Degeneracy pressure keeps {{dense stars in equilibrium, independent of the thermal structure of the star}}. <!--SR:!2025-04-14,188,312!2025-02-16,136,292!2024-10-21,63,312!2024-12-29,103,292!2025-05-04,206,312!2025-03-24,177,312!2025-03-28,177,312!2024-11-04,66,270!2024-10-21,64,312!2024-10-28,69,312-->
