# homogeneity and heterogeneity

## examples

### chemistry

#### chemical reactions

A _homogeneous reaction_ is {{a [chemical reaction](chemical%20reaction.md) in which the [reactants](reagent.md) and [products](product%20(chemistry).md) are in the same [phase](phase%20(matter).md), while a _heterogeneous reaction_ has multiple phases}}. They can also be applied to {{a [dynamic equilibrium](dynamic%20equilibrium.md) as _homogeneous equilibrium_ and _heterogeneous equilibrium_}}.
