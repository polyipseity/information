# comparative advantage

__Comparative advantage__ in {@{an [economic model](economic%20model.md)}@} is {@{the advantage over others in producing a particular [good](goods.md)}@}. A good can be {@{produced at a lower relative [opportunity cost](opportunity%20cost.md) or [autarky](autarky.md) price, i.e. at a lower relative [marginal cost](marginal%20cost.md) prior to trade}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> Comparative advantage describes {@{the economic reality of the [gains from trade](gains%20from%20trade.md) for individuals, firms, or nations}@}, which arise from {@{differences in their [factor endowments](factor%20endowment.md) or technological progress}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-25,70,310!2024-12-16,62,310!2025-07-24,229,330!2024-12-20,66,310!2024-12-16,62,310-->

{@{[David Ricardo](David%20Ricardo.md)}@} developed {@{the classical theory of comparative advantage in 1817}@} to {@{explain why countries engage in [international trade](international%20trade.md) even when one country's workers are more efficient at producing _every_ single good than workers in other countries}@}. He demonstrated that if {@{two countries capable of producing two commodities engage in the [free market](free%20market.md) (albeit with the assumption that the capital and labour do not move internationally<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup>)}@}, then {@{each country will increase its overall consumption by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage while importing the other good}@}, provided that {@{there exist differences in [labor productivity](workforce%20productivity.md) between both countries}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup><sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> Widely regarded as {@{one of the most powerful<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> yet counter-intuitive<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> insights}@} in economics, Ricardo's theory implies that {@{comparative advantage rather than [absolute advantage](absolute%20advantage.md) is responsible for much of international trade}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-11,57,310!2025-01-09,68,270!2024-12-20,66,310!2025-01-28,82,270!2025-02-11,99,290!2024-12-20,66,310!2024-12-16,62,310!2024-12-25,70,310-->

## classical theory and David Ricardo's formulation

{@{[Adam Smith](Adam%20Smith.md)}@} first {@{alluded to the concept of _absolute advantage_ as the basis for international trade in 1776}@}, in {@{_[The Wealth of Nations](The%20Wealth%20of%20Nations.md)_}@}: <!--SR:!2024-12-20,66,310!2025-02-02,75,250!2025-04-25,158,310-->

> If {@{a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it}@}, {@{better buy it off them with some part of the produce of our own industry employed in a way in which we have some advantage}@}. The general industry of the country, being {@{always in proportion to the capital which employs it}@}, will {@{not thereby be diminished [...] but only left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the greatest advantage}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-24,109,290!2025-05-10,154,290!2024-12-11,57,310!2024-12-20,66,310-->

Writing {@{several decades after Smith in 1808}@}, {@{[Robert Torrens](Robert%20Torrens%20(economist).md)}@} articulated {@{a preliminary definition of comparative advantage as the loss from the closing of trade}@}: <!--SR:!2025-04-29,146,290!2025-07-10,215,310!2025-04-04,131,290-->

> [I]f {@{I wish to know the extent of the advantage}@}, which arises to England, from her giving France a hundred pounds of [broadcloth](broadcloth.md), in exchange for a hundred pounds of lace, I {@{take the quantity of lace which she has acquired by this transaction}@}, and {@{compare it with the quantity which she might, at the same expense of labour and capital, have acquired by manufacturing it at home}@}. The lace that {@{remains, beyond what the labour and capital employed on the cloth, might have fabricated at home}@}, is {@{the amount of the advantage which England derives from the exchange}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-11,57,310!2024-12-11,57,310!2025-01-11,76,290!2025-07-09,214,310!2024-12-11,57,310-->

In {@{1814}@} the {@{anonymously published pamphlet _Considerations on the Importation of Foreign Corn_}@} featured {@{the earliest recorded formulation of the concept of comparative advantage}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup><sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> Torrens would later {@{publish his work _External Corn Trade_ in 1815 acknowledging this pamphlet author's priority}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-07,110,290!2024-12-16,62,310!2025-07-22,227,330!2025-03-22,129,290-->

In {@{1817}@}, {@{[David Ricardo](David%20Ricardo.md)}@} published {@{what has since become known as the theory of comparative advantage in his book _[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation](On%20the%20Principles%20of%20Political%20Economy%20and%20Taxation.md)_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-31,84,270!2024-12-16,62,310!2025-01-19,82,290-->

### Ricardo's example

In a famous example, Ricardo considers {@{a [world economy](world%20economy.md) consisting of two countries, [Portugal](portugal.md) and [England](england.md)}@}, each {@{producing two goods of identical quality}@}. In Portugal, {@{the _[a priori](a%20priori%20and%20a%20posteriori.md)_ more efficient country}@}, it is possible to {@{produce [wine](wine.md) and [cloth](textile.md#cloth) with less labor than it would take to produce the same quantities in England}@}. However, {@{the relative costs or ranking of cost of producing those two goods differ between the countries}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-23,228,330!2024-12-11,57,310!2025-07-25,230,330!2024-12-25,70,310!2025-04-28,145,290-->

Hours of work necessary to produce one unit

| __Country\Produce__ | __Cloth__ | __Wine__ |
| ------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| __England__         | 100       | 120      |
| __Portugal__        | 90        | 80       |

In this illustration, England could commit 100 hours of labor to produce one unit of cloth, or produce ⁠5/6⁠ units of wine. Meanwhile, in comparison, Portugal could commit 100 hours of labor to produce ⁠10/9⁠ units of cloth, or produce ⁠10/8⁠ units of wine. Portugal possesses {@{an _absolute advantage_ in producing both cloth and wine due to more produced per hour (since ⁠10/9⁠ > 1)}@}. If {@{the capital and labour were mobile}@}, {@{both wine and cloth should be made in Portugal, with the capital and labour of England removed there}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> If {@{they were not mobile}@}, as {@{Ricardo believed them to be generally}@}, then {@{England's _comparative advantage_ (due to lower opportunity cost) in producing cloth}@} means that {@{it has an incentive to produce more of that good which is relatively cheaper for them to produce than the other}@}—assuming {@{they have an advantageous opportunity to trade in the marketplace for the other more difficult to produce good}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-16,62,310!2024-12-25,70,310!2025-07-21,226,330!2024-12-25,70,310!2024-12-20,66,310!2025-07-25,230,330!2024-12-16,62,310!2024-12-16,62,310-->

In {@{the absence of trade}@}, England {@{requires 220 hours of work}@} to both produce and consume one unit each of cloth and wine while Portugal {@{requires 170 hours of work}@} to produce and consume the same quantities. England is {@{more efficient (in terms of opportunity cost) at producing cloth than wine, and Portugal is more efficient (in terms of opportunity cost) at producing wine than cloth}@}. So, if {@{each country specializes in the good for which it has a comparative advantage}@}, then {@{the global production of both goods increases}@}, for England can spend {@{220 labor hours to produce 2.2 units of cloth while Portugal can spend 170 hours to produce 2.125 units of wine}@}. Moreover, if {@{both countries specialize in the above manner and England trades a unit of its cloth for ⁠5/6⁠ to ⁠9/8⁠ units of Portugal's wine}@}, then {@{both countries can consume at least a unit each of cloth and wine}@}, with {@{0 to 0.2 units of cloth and 0 to 0.125 units of wine remaining in each respective country to be consumed or exported}@}. Consequently, both England and Portugal can {@{consume more wine and cloth under free trade than in [autarky](autarky.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-16,62,310!2024-12-20,66,310!2025-02-25,109,290!2024-12-25,70,310!2024-12-11,57,310!2024-12-11,57,310!2025-02-13,92,270!2024-12-09,55,310!2025-02-03,94,290!2024-12-25,70,310!2024-12-16,62,310-->
