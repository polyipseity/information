# arch

## hinged arches

### three-hinged arches

A three-hinged arch is {@{not only hinged at its base, like the [two-hinged arch](#two-hinged%20arch), but also at its apex}@}. The hinges are {@{[pinned supports](structural%20support.md#pinned%20support)}@}. Unlikely other hinged arches, it is {@{[statically determinate](statically%20indeterminate.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-21,259,330!2025-01-23,175,310!2025-04-28,265,330-->

When analyzing a three-hinged arch in 2 dimensions, we also need to {@{consider its horizontal length $L$ and vertical height $h$}@}. There are {@{4 unknown reactions at the 2 base pinned supports}@} to be solved. By {@{splitting the arch into two halves, two [free body diagrams](free%20body%20diagram.md) are obtained}@}, allowing {@{6 unknown forces (including the apex pinned support)}@} to be solved. Note that for the apex pinned support, {@{the force directions are reversed for exactly one of the two free body diagrams}@}. After that, analyzing it is similar to {@{[method of joints](truss.md#method%20of%20joints), but also considering the moment equilibrium equations}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-12,278,290!2025-01-21,184,310!2024-11-23,130,290!2024-11-23,127,290!2024-11-27,132,290!2025-06-15,250,270-->
