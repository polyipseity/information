# arch

## hinged arches

### three-hinged arches

A three-hinged arch is {{not only hinged at its base, like the [two-hinged arch](#two-hinged%20arch), but also at its apex}}. The hinges are {{[pinned supports](structural%20support.md#pinned%20support)}}. Unlikely other hinged arches, it is {{[statically determinate](statically%20indeterminate.md)}}.

When analyzing a three-hinged arch in 2 dimensions, we also need to {{consider its horizontal length $L$ and vertical height $h$}}. There are {{4 unknown reactions at the 2 base pinned supports}} to be solved. By {{splitting the arch into two halves, two [free body diagrams](free%20body%20diagram.md) are obtained}}, allowing {{6 unknown forces (including the apex pinned support)}} to be solved. Note that for the apex pinned support, {{the force directions are reversed for exactly one of the two free body diagrams}}. After that, analyzing it is similar to {{[method of joints](truss.md#method%20of%20joints), but also considering the moment equilibrium equations}}.
