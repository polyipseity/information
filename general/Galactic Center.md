# Galactic Center

The __Galactic Center__ is {{the [barycenter](barycenter%20(astronomy).md) of the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md) and a corresponding point on the [rotational axis](rotation.md) of the galaxy}}. Its [central massive object](central%20massive%20object.md) is {{a [supermassive black hole](supermassive%20black%20hole.md) of about 4 million [solar masses](solar%20mass.md), which is called [Sagittarius A*](Sagittarius%20A*.md)}}, a {{compact [radio source](astronomical%20radio%20source.md) which is almost exactly at the galactic rotational center}}. The Galactic Center is {{approximately 8 kiloparsecs (26&nbsp;000 ly) away from Earth in the direction of the [constellations](constellation.md) [Sagittarius](sagittarius%20(constellation).md), [Ophiuchus](ophiuchus.md), and [Scorpius](scorpius.md)}}, where the Milky Way appears {{brightest, visually close to the [Butterfly Cluster](Butterfly%20Cluster.md) (M6) or the star [Shaula](Lambda%20Scorpii.md), south to the [Pipe Nebula](Pipe%20Nebula.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-25,62,310!2024-11-15,69,270!2024-09-18,30,270!2024-10-11,48,270!2024-10-02,34,230-->

There are {{around 10 million [stars](star.md) within one [parsec](parsec.md) of the Galactic Center}}, dominated by {{[red giants](red%20giant.md), with a significant population of massive [supergiants](supergiant.md) and [Wolf–Rayet stars](Wolf–Rayet%20star.md) from star formation in the region around 1 million years ago}}. The core stars are {{a small part within the much wider [galactic bulge](galactic%20bulge.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-16,48,250!2024-11-01,58,250!2024-10-08,46,290-->
