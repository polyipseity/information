# Galactic Center

The __Galactic Center__ is {@{the [barycenter](barycenter%20(astronomy).md) of the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md) and a corresponding point on the [rotational axis](rotation.md) of the galaxy}@}. Its [central massive object](central%20massive%20object.md) is {@{a [supermassive black hole](supermassive%20black%20hole.md) of about 4 million [solar masses](solar%20mass.md), which is called [Sagittarius A*](Sagittarius%20A*.md)}@}, a {@{compact [radio source](astronomical%20radio%20source.md) which is almost exactly at the galactic rotational center}@}. The Galactic Center is {@{approximately 8 kiloparsecs (26&nbsp;000 ly) away from Earth in the direction of the [constellations](constellation.md) [Sagittarius](sagittarius%20(constellation).md), [Ophiuchus](ophiuchus.md), and [Scorpius](scorpius.md)}@}, where the Milky Way appears {@{brightest, visually close to the [Butterfly Cluster](Butterfly%20Cluster.md) (M6) or the star [Shaula](Lambda%20Scorpii.md), south to the [Pipe Nebula](Pipe%20Nebula.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-19,267,330!2025-08-04,262,290!2025-10-07,304,290!2025-04-13,180,290!2025-06-16,180,230-->

There are {@{around 10 million [stars](star.md) within one [parsec](parsec.md) of the Galactic Center}@}, dominated by {@{[red giants](red%20giant.md), with a significant population of massive [supergiants](supergiant.md) and [Wolf–Rayet stars](Wolf–Rayet%20star.md) from star formation in the region around 1 million years ago}@}. The core stars are {@{a small part within the much wider [galactic bulge](galactic%20bulge.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-07,172,270!2025-03-28,147,250!2025-04-10,184,310-->
