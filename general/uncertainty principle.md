# uncertainty principle

The __uncertainty principle__, also known as {{__Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle__}}, is {{a fundamental concept in [quantum mechanics](quantum%20mechanics.md). It states that there is a limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and [momentum](momentum.md), can be simultaneously known}}. In other words, {{the more accurately one property is measured, the less accurately the other property can be known}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-23,15,290!2024-08-21,13,290!2024-08-22,14,290-->
