# tide

__Tides__ are {{the rise and fall of [sea levels](sea%20level.md)}} caused by {{the combined effects of the [gravitational](gravity.md) forces exerted by the [Moon](Moon.md) (and to a much lesser extent, the [Sun](Sun.md)) and are also caused by the [Earth](Earth.md) and [Moon](Moon.md) [orbiting](orbit.md) one another}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-12,62,310!2024-11-06,69,270-->

## tidal constituents

### range variation: springs and neaps

- see: [tidal range](tidal%20range.md)

The semi-diurnal range ({{the difference in height between high and low waters over about half a day}}) varies in {{a two-week cycle}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-01,52,310!2024-10-23,70,310-->

Approximately {{twice a month, around [new moon](new%20moon.md) and [full moon](full%20moon.md) when the [Sun](Sun.md), [Moon](Moon.md), and [Earth](Earth.md) form a line (a configuration known as a [syzygy](syzygy%20(astronomy.md).md))}}, the [tidal force](tidal%20force.md) {{due to the Sun reinforces that due to the Moon}}. The tide's range is then {{at its maximum; this is called the __spring tide__ or sometimes __syzygy tides__}}. It is {{not named after the [spring season](spring%20(season).md), but rather, like the season, derives from the meaning "jump, burst forth, rise", as in a natural [spring](spring%20(hydrology).md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-29,46,290!2024-10-02,53,310!2025-01-01,116,290!2024-10-04,55,310-->

When {{the [Moon](Moon.md) is at first quarter or third quarter, the [Sun](Sun.md) and [Moon](Moon.md) are separated by 90° when viewed from the [Earth](Earth.md)}}, and {{the weaker solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's stronger tidal force}}. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is {{at its minimum; this is called the __neap tide__, __neaps__, or sometimes __quadrature tides__}}. "Neap" is {{an Anglo-Saxon word meaning "without the power", as in forðganges nip (forth-going without-the-power)}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-03,54,310!2024-09-29,51,310!2025-01-09,121,290!2024-11-06,66,270-->

## physics

### equilibrium

The {{__equilibrium tide__}} is {{the idealized tide assuming a landless Earth}}. The ocean would {{have a tidal bulge elongated towards the attracting body ([Moon](Moon.md) or [Sun](Sun.md))}}. Note that it is _not_ {{caused by the vertical pull or push nearest or farthest from the body, which is very weak compared to the opposing [gravity](gravity.md)}}; rather, it is caused by {{the tangential or [tractive](traction%20(mechanics).md) [tidal force](tidal%20force.md), strongest at about 45 degree from the body and does not need to oppose gravity}}, resulting in {{a horizontal tidal current}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-22,69,310!2025-02-10,148,310!2024-09-27,47,290!2024-09-28,50,310!2024-10-05,56,310!2024-10-16,65,310-->

The rotation of [Earth](Earth.md) {{does not affect the equilibrium tide}}. Therefore, each day {{has about two tides}}. However, it does {{rotate the current tide eastward away from the equilibrium tide}}, causing {{the attracting body to pull the tide back to the equilibrium tide (or by [Newton's third law](Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md#third%20law) equivalently, the tide pulls the Moon ahead to orbit faster temporarily)}}, which is responsible for {{[tidal dissipation](#dissipation)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-26,45,290!2024-10-17,66,310!2025-01-17,132,310!2025-03-12,171,310!2024-09-26,49,290-->

### dissipation

- see: [tidal acceleration](tidal%20acceleration.md)

Earth's tidal oscillations introduce dissipation at {{an [average](average.md) rate of about 3.75 [terawatts](watt.md#terawatt)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-27,80,250-->
