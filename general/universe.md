# universe

The __universe__ is {{all of [space](space.md) and [time](time.md) and their contents}}. <!--SR:!2025-04-25,231,330-->

## composition

- see: [galaxy cluster](galaxy%20cluster.md), [galaxy formation and evolution](galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md), [nebula](nebula.md)

The universe is composed {{almost completely of dark energy, dark matter, and [ordinary matter](matter.md)}}. Other contents are {{[electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) (estimated to constitute from 0.005% to close to 0.01% of the total [mass–energy](mass–energy%20equivalence.md) of the universe) and [antimatter](antimatter.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-08-16,280,336!2024-11-17,64,276-->

{{The proportions of all types of matter and energy}} have {{changed over the history of the universe}}. {{The total amount of electromagnetic radiation generated within the universe}} has {{decreased by 1/2 in the past 2 billion years}}. Today, {{ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and [life](life.md)}}, accounts for {{only 4.9% of the contents of the universe}}. The present overall [density](density.md) of this type of matter is {{very low, roughly 4.5×10<sup>−31</sup> grams per cubic centimeter, corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic metres of volume}}. {{The nature of both dark energy and dark matter}} is {{unknown}}. {{Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified}}, accounts for {{26.8% of the cosmic contents}}. {{Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate}}, accounts for {{the remaining 68.3% of the contents}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-16,70,316!2025-06-21,236,336!2024-11-19,72,316!2025-02-14,121,296!2025-07-22,262,336!2025-03-20,149,296!2025-01-23,99,256!2025-07-29,268,336!2025-05-02,184,316!2025-06-08,209,316!2025-03-24,137,256!2025-01-25,109,296!2025-02-03,107,256-->
