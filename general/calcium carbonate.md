# calcium carbonate

__Calcium carbonate__, also known as {{limestone}}, is a solid [ionic compound](ionic%20compound.md). Its molecular formula is {{CaCO<sub>3</sub>}}. It looks like a {{white solid}}.

It is commonly found in {{the [rocks](rock%20(geology).md) [limestone](limestone.md), [chalk](chalk.md), and [marble](marble.md)}} as {{the [minerals](mineral.md) [calcite](calcite.md), [aragonite](aragonite.md), and [dolomite](dolomite%20(mineral).md)}}.

## reactions

Calcium carbonate {{[decomposes](thermal%20decomposition.md) under heating}}.
> {{CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) $\xrightarrow{\text{heat} }$ CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)}}

It also {{reacts with [acids](acid.md)}}.
> {{CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2HCl(aq) â†’ CaCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)}}

### tests

To test for calcium carbonate, both {{calcium ions and carbonate ions}} are tested for. The former can be detected by the {{[flame test](flame%20test.md)}}, in which a {{brick red flame}} can be observed. The latter can be tested by adding {{[dilute hydrochloric acid](dilute%20hydrochloric%20acid)}}, in which {{colorless gas}} that {{turns [limewater](calcium%20hydroxide.md) milky}} is given out.
