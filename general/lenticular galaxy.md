# lenticular galaxy

A {{__lenticular galaxy__}} (denoted {{S0}}) is {{a [type of galaxy](galaxy%20morphological%20classification.md) intermediate between an [elliptical](elliptical%20galaxy.md) (denoted E) and a [spiral galaxy](spiral%20galaxy.md) in [galaxy morphological classification](galaxy%20morphological%20classification.md) schemes}}. It contains {{a large-scale disc but does not have large-scale spiral arms}}. Lenticular galaxies are {{[disc galaxies](disc%20galaxy.md) that have used up or lost most of their [interstellar matter](interstellar%20medium.md) and therefore have very little ongoing [star formation](star%20formation.md)}}. They may, however, {{retain significant dust in their disks}}. As a result, they consist {{mainly of aging stars (like elliptical galaxies)}}. Despite the morphological differences, {{lenticular and elliptical galaxies share common properties like spectral features and scaling relations}}. Both can be considered {{early-type galaxies that are passively evolving, at least in the local part of the [universe](universe.md)}}. Connecting the E galaxies with the S0 galaxies are {{the ES galaxies with intermediate-scale discs}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-22,14,290!2024-08-21,13,290!2024-08-24,16,290!2024-08-21,13,290!2024-08-29,17,250!2024-08-23,15,290!2024-08-19,11,270!2024-08-20,12,270!2024-09-01,18,250!2024-08-20,12,270-->
