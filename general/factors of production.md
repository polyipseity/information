# factors of production

In [economics](economics.md), __factors of production__, __resources__, or __inputs__ are {{what is used in the production process to produce [output](output%20(economics).md)}}—that is, {{[goods](goods.md) and [services](service%20(economics).md)}}. The utilized amounts of the various inputs determine {{the quantity of output according to the relationship called the [production function](production%20function.md)}}. There are {{four _basic_ [resources](resource.md) or factors of production: land, labour, capital and entrepreneur (or enterprise)}}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> The factors are also frequently labeled {{"__producer goods or services__"}} to {{distinguish them from the goods or services purchased by consumers, which are frequently labeled "[consumer goods](final%20good.md)"}}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-10-13,14,290!2024-10-12,13,290!2024-10-15,16,290!2024-10-11,13,270!2024-10-13,14,290!2024-10-11,13,270-->

There are {{two types of factors: _primary_ and _secondary_}}. {{The previously mentioned primary factors}} are {{land, labour and capital}}. {{Materials and energy}} are {{considered secondary factors in [classical economics](classical%20economics.md)}} because {{they are obtained from land, labour, and capital}}. The primary factors {{facilitate production}} but {{neither become part of the product (as with [raw materials](raw%20material.md)) nor become significantly transformed by the [production process](industrial%20processes.md) (as with fuel used to power machinery)}}. Land includes {{not only the site of production but also [natural resources](natural%20resource.md) above or below the [soil](soil.md)}}. Recent usage has distinguished {{[human capital](human%20capital.md) (the stock of knowledge in the [labor force](workforce.md)) from labour}}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> {{Entrepreneurship}} is {{also sometimes considered a factor of production}}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> Sometimes {{the overall state of [technology](technology.md)}} is {{described as a factor of production}}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> {{The number and definition of factors}} vary, depending on {{theoretical purpose, empirical emphasis, or [school of economics](schools%20of%20economic%20thought.md)}}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-10-14,15,290!2024-10-14,15,290!2024-10-15,16,290!2024-10-14,15,290!2024-10-16,17,290!2024-10-11,13,270!2024-10-15,16,290!2024-10-14,15,290!2024-10-08,10,270!2024-10-08,10,270!2024-10-12,13,290!2024-10-12,13,290!2024-10-16,17,290!2024-10-16,17,290!2024-10-13,14,290!2024-10-12,13,290-->
