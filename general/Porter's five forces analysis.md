## five forces that shape competition

The 5 forces are {{threat of _new entrants_, bargaining power of _buyers_, threat of _substitutes_, bargaining power of _suppliers_, and _industry_ rivalry}}. The first 4 forces {{surrounds the last force in a loop}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-15,51,290!2024-08-13,53,310-->

### threat of new entrants

{{Barriers to entry}} restrict the threat of new entrants. The barriers can be {{business nature or government regulations}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-14,54,310!2024-08-30,66,310-->

### threat of substitutes

A substitute product {{uses a different technology to solve the same economic need}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-02,69,310-->

### bargaining power of buyers

Buyers' power is high if {{there are many alternatives, and low if there are few}}. Unbranded or commoditized products or services have {{no loyalty from buyers}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-04,71,310!2024-09-01,68,310-->

### bargaining power of suppliers

Suppliers' power is high if {{there are few suppliers, and low if there are many}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-24,62,310-->

### industry rivalry

Industry rivalry is {{the extent of competition among existing firms}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-26,64,310-->

## usage

Porter's five forces framework is great for {{classical industries involving physical goods}}, but not {{globalized markets, industries not affected by all 5 forces, internet businesses, or new sectors spanning multiple industries}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-26,62,310!2024-10-05,79,270-->
