> {{Buoyancy equals the [weight](weight.md) of displaced [fluid](fluid.md). For a floating object, the [weight](weight.md) of displaced [fluid](fluid.md) is the [weight](weight.md) of the object. For a sunken object, the [volume](volume.md) of displaced [fluid](fluid.md) is the [volume](volume.md) of the object.}}
