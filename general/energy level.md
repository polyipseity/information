# energy level

A {@{[bound](bound%20state.md) [quantum mechanical](quantum%20mechanics.md) system or [particle](particle.md)}@} can only have {@{certain discrete values of energy}@}, called __energy levels__. <!--SR:!2025-04-15,383,230!2026-11-02,1002,290-->

The lowest possible energy level is called the {@{_[ground state](ground%20state.md)_}@}, while all other higher energy levels are called {@{_[excited states](excited%20state.md)_}@}. <!--SR:!2028-07-14,1587,350!2028-05-05,1532,350-->
