# Hooke's law

## formal definition

### linear springs

Hooke's law states that {{$$F_s = kx$$ with $F_s$ in N being the [tension](tension%20(physics).md) and $x$ in m being the amount the coils are stretched from its equilibrium position}}. $k$ is the {{spring constant or stiffness in N/m}}.

This formula states that {{the springs exert a force proportional to the change in length}}. This is {{approximately true for deformations that are small compared to the entire length}}.
