# Hooke's law

## formal definition

### linear springs

Hooke's law states that {@{$$F_s = kx$$ with $F_s$ in N being the [tension](tension%20(physics).md) and $x$ in m being the amount the coils are stretched from its equilibrium position}@}. $k$ is the {@{spring constant or stiffness in N/m}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-04,523,310!2025-05-31,290,330-->

This formula states that {@{the springs exert a force proportional to the change in length}@}. This is {@{approximately true for deformations that are small compared to the entire length}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-12,252,330!2024-12-13,159,310-->
