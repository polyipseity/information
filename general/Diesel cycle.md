# Diesel cycle

## idealized Diesel cycle

### maximum thermal efficiency

> __maximum thermal efficiency of a Diesel cycle__
>
> {{$$\eta_\mathrm{th} = 1 - \frac1{r^{\gamma - 1}}\left(\frac{\alpha^\gamma - 1}{\gamma(\alpha - 1)}\right)$$}}
>
> - where
>     - {{$\gamma$ is the [heat capacity ratio](heat%20capacity%20ratio.md), $r = \frac{V_1}{V_2}$ is the [compression ratio](compression%20ratio.md) (i.e. the ratio of the [volume](volume.md) at its maximum over that at its minimum), and $\alpha = \frac{V_3}{V_2} = \frac{T_3}{T_1 r^{\gamma - 1}}$ is the cutoff ratio}}
