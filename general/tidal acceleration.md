# tidal acceleration

__Tidal acceleration__ is {{an effect of the [tidal forces](tidal%20force.md) between an [orbiting](orbit.md) [natural satellite](natural%20satellite.md) (e.g. the [Moon](Moon.md)) and the [primary](primary%20body.md) [planet](planet.md) that it orbits (e.g. [Earth](Earth.md))}}. The acceleration causes {{a gradual recession of a satellite in a [prograde](retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) orbit (satellite moving to a higher orbit, away from the primary body), and a corresponding slowdown of the primary's [rotation](rotation.md)}}. This process eventually leads to {{[_tidal locking_](tidal%20locking.md), usually the smaller body first, and later the larger body}}. {{The [Earthâ€“Moon system](orbit%20of%20the%20Moon.md)}} is the best-studied case. <!--SR:!2024-10-14,64,310!2024-10-24,58,270!2025-03-19,175,310!2024-10-05,56,310-->

{{The similar process of __tidal deceleration__}} occurs for satellites that {{have an orbital period that is shorter than the primary's rotational period, or that [orbit](orbit.md) in a [retrograde](retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) direction}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-05,52,290!2025-02-15,151,310-->

The naming is somewhat confusing, because {{the average speed of the satellite relative to the body it orbits is _decreased_ as a result of tidal acceleration, and _increased_ as a result of tidal deceleration}}. This conundrum occurs because {{a positive acceleration at one instant causes the satellite to loop farther outward during the next half orbit, decreasing its average speed over the entire orbit}}. A continuing positive acceleration causes {{the satellite to spiral outward with a decreasing speed and angular rate, resulting in a negative acceleration of angle}}. A continuing negative acceleration has the opposite effect. However, the angular momentum of the satellite {{still increases (decreases for tidal deceleration)}}, as the orbital speed is {{inversely proportional to the square of the orbital radius ($v \propto \frac 1 {\sqrt r}$)}}, so {{the increase in radius increases the angular momentum faster than the decrease in orbital speed decreasing the angular momentum}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-03,50,290!2025-02-02,129,290!2024-12-10,91,270!2024-09-28,48,290!2025-02-05,133,290!2024-09-28,49,310-->
