# elliptical galaxy

An __elliptical galaxy__ (denoted {{E}}) is {{a type of [galaxy](galaxy.md) with an approximately [ellipsoidal](ellipsoid.md) shape and a smooth, nearly featureless image}}. They are {{one of the four main [classes of galaxy](galaxy%20morphological%20classification.md) described by [Edwin Hubble](Edwin%20Hubble.md)}} in {{his [Hubble sequence](Hubble%20sequence.md#physical%20significance) and 1936 work _The Realm of the Nebulae_}}, along with {{[spiral](spiral%20galaxy.md) and [lenticular](lenticular%20galaxy.md) galaxies}}. Elliptical galaxies are, together with {{lenticular galaxies (S0) with their large-scale disks, and ES galaxies with their intermediate scale disks}}, a subset of {{the "early-type" galaxy population}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-19,11,270!2024-08-25,17,290!2024-08-24,16,290!2024-08-25,17,290!2024-08-19,11,270!2024-08-10,4,230!2024-08-18,12,270-->
