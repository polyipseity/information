# elliptical galaxy

An __elliptical galaxy__ (denoted {{E}}) is {{a type of [galaxy](galaxy.md) with an approximately [ellipsoidal](ellipsoid.md) shape and a smooth, nearly featureless image}}. They are {{one of the four main [classes of galaxy](galaxy%20morphological%20classification.md) described by [Edwin Hubble](Edwin%20Hubble.md)}} in {{his [Hubble sequence](Hubble%20sequence.md#physical%20significance) and 1936 work _The Realm of the Nebulae_}}, along with {{[spiral](spiral%20galaxy.md) and [lenticular](lenticular%20galaxy.md) galaxies}}. Elliptical galaxies are, together with {{lenticular galaxies (S0) with their large-scale disks, and ES galaxies with their intermediate scale disks}}, a subset of {{the "early-type" galaxy population}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,160,310!2024-11-06,72,310!2024-10-13,50,290!2024-11-03,69,310!2024-11-28,73,270!2024-10-14,38,230!2025-01-14,118,290-->
