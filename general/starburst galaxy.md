# starburst galaxy

A __starburst galaxy__ is {{one undergoing an exceptionally high rate of [star formation](star%20formation.md), as compared to the long-term average rate of star formation in the [galaxy](galaxy.md), or the star formation rate observed in most other galaxies}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-22,48,310-->

For example, the star formation rate of the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md) galaxy is {{approximately 3 [M<sub>☉</sub>](solar%20mass.md)/yr}}, while {{starburst galaxies can experience star formation rates of 100 M<sub>☉</sub>/yr or more}}. In a starburst galaxy, {{the rate of star formation is so large that the galaxy consumes all of its gas reservoir, from which the stars are forming, on a timescale much shorter than the age of the galaxy}}. As such, {{the [starburst](starburst%20region.md) nature of a galaxy is a phase}}, and one that {{typically occupies a brief period of a [galaxy's evolution](galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md)}}. The majority of starburst galaxies are {{in the midst of a [merger](galaxy%20merger.md) or [close encounter](interacting%20galaxy.md) with another galaxy}}. Starburst galaxies include {{[M82](messier%2082.md), [NGC 4038/NGC 4039](Antennae%20Galaxies.md) (the Antennae Galaxies), and [IC 10](IC%2010.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-05,14,290!2024-09-08,17,290!2024-09-08,17,290!2024-09-06,15,290!2024-09-07,16,290!2024-09-05,14,290!2024-09-07,12,210-->
