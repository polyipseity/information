# total addressable market

## importance

TAM shows {{the potential of your company to you and investors}}. Ideally, when calculating TAM, do not {{make up numbers, but instead use references to data sources}}. It can be treated as a {{long-term goal, though unrealistic to reach}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-28,17,292!2024-05-23,12,272!2024-05-25,14,292-->

## difference between TAM, SAM, and SOM

Total addressable market (TAM), or {{total available market}}, is {{the annual revenue if 100% share of a selected market is achieved in a selected geographic location, such as not considering competition and travel distance}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-23,12,272!2024-06-10,22,272-->

[Serviceable available market](serviceable%20available%20market.md) (SAM) is {{the portion of TAM one can reach via our customer channels, such as considering travel distance but not competition}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-24,13,270-->

[Serviceable obtainable market](target%20market.md) (SOM), {{share of market, or target market}}, is {{the portion of SAM one can realistically capture, such as considering competition and travel distance}}. It is usually {{much smaller than SAM, like 6% to 10% depending on the number of competitors}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-25,14,292!2024-06-15,27,272!2024-06-17,29,272-->
