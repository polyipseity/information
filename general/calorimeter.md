# calorimeter

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../tools/utility.py.md
```

A __calorimeter__ is {{an object used for [calorimetry](calorimetry.md)}}. It can be used to {{measure the [heat](heat.md) of [physical changes](physical%20change.md) or [chemical reactions](chemical%20reaction.md)}}.

A simple calorimeter consists of {{a [thermometer](thermometer.md) attached to a [metal](metal.md) container filled with [water](water.md) above a [combustion](combustion.md) chamber}}. For more accurate measurements, {{a bomb calorimeter can be used}}.

## errors

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects('aa02', '2845'),
  (
    'conditions are not standard conditions',
    'heat capacities of equipment are not accounted for',
    'heat loss to the surroundings',
    'reaction is incomplete',
  ),
)
```
