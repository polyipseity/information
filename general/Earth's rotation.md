# Earth's rotation

__Earth's rotation__ or __Earth's spin__ is {{the [rotation](rotation.md) of planet [Earth](Earth.md) around its own [axis](rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md), as well as changes in the [orientation](orientation%20(geometry).md) of the rotation axis in space}}. Earth rotates {{[eastward](east.md), in [prograde motion](retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md)}}, with {{an [axial tilt](axial%20tilt.md) of 23.4392811Â°}}. As viewed from {{the [northern polar star](pole%20star.md) [Polaris](Polaris.md), Earth turns [counterclockwise](clockwise.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-16,16,290!2024-07-13,13,290!2024-07-13,2,170!2024-07-15,15,290-->

Earth rotates once {{in about 24 hours with respect to the [Sun](Sun.md) (synodic/stellar), but once about every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to other distant [stars](star.md) (sidereal; [see below](#stellar%20and%20sidereal%20day))}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-17,17,290-->
