# quick ratio

In [finance](finance.md), the __quick ratio__, also known as {@{the __acid-test ratio__}@}, is {@{a [liquidity ratio](accounting%20liquidity.md) that measures the ability of a company to use [near-cash assets](cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents.md) (or 'quick' assets) to extinguish or retire [current liabilities](current%20liability.md) immediately}@}. It is {@{the [ratio](financial%20ratio.md) between quick assets and current liabilities}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-13,64,310!2025-06-30,215,330!2025-03-04,113,290-->

A normal liquid ratio is {@{considered to be 1:1}@}. {@{A company with a quick ratio of less than 1}@} cannot {@{currently fully pay back its current liabilities}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-02,146,310!2025-06-24,210,330!2025-06-08,195,310-->

The quick ratio is {@{similar to the [current ratio](current%20ratio.md)}@}, but {@{it provides a more conservative assessment of the liquidity position of a firm as it excludes [inventory](inventory.md),<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> which it does not consider as sufficiently liquid}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,221,330!2024-12-11,62,310-->

## formula

- quick ratio formula ::@:: $${\text{Quick Ratio} }={\frac {\text{Quick Assets} }{\text{Current Liabilities} } }$$ <!--SR:!2025-07-31,241,330!2024-12-06,59,310-->

Where quick assets can be defined as follows ::@:: $${\text{Quick Assets} }={\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents} }+{\text{Marketable Securities} }+{\text{Accounts Receivable} }={\text{Current Assets} }-{\text{Inventory} }-{\text{Prepaid Expenses} }$$ <!--SR:!2024-12-20,53,250!2024-12-28,64,270-->

Although the quick ratio is {@{a test for the financial viability of a business}@}, it {@{does not give a complete picture of the business's health}@}. For example, if {@{a business has large amounts in [accounts receivable](accounts%20receivable.md) due for payment after a long period, while also having larger [accounts payable](accounts%20payable.md) due for immediate payment}@}, the quick ratio {@{may look healthy when the business is actually about to run out of cash}@}. In contrast, if {@{a business has fast payment from customers, but long terms from suppliers}@}, it may {@{have a low quick ratio and yet be very healthy}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-30,186,310!2025-05-22,181,310!2025-05-30,188,310!2025-05-01,151,290!2025-07-11,223,330!2025-03-12,115,290-->

Generally, the acid test ratio should be {@{1:1 or higher for a healthy company}@}. However, this {@{varies widely by industry}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> In general, {@{the higher the ratio, the greater the company's [accounting liquidity](accounting%20liquidity.md)}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-07,102,290!2025-08-16,254,330!2024-12-11,64,310-->
