# radiation zone

A __radiation zone__, or __radiative region__ is {{a layer of a [star](star.md)'s interior (though not necessarily the core) where [energy](energy.md) is primarily transported toward the exterior by means of [radiative diffusion](radiation.md) and [thermal conduction](thermal%20conduction.md), rather than by [convection](convection%20(heat%20transfer).md)}}. Energy travels through the radiation zone {{in the form of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) as [photons](photon.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-12,34,270!2024-09-28,72,310-->
