# radiation zone

A __radiation zone__, or __radiative region__ is {{a layer of a [star](star.md)'s interior (though not necessarily the core) where [energy](energy.md) is primarily transported toward the exterior by means of [radiative diffusion](radiation.md) and [thermal conduction](thermal%20conduction.md), rather than by [convection](convection%20(heat%20transfer).md)}}. Energy travels through the radiation zone {{in the form of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) as [photons](photon.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-16,126,290!2024-09-28,72,310-->

## main sequence stars

For [main sequence](main%20sequence.md) [stars](star.md)â€”those stars that are {{generating [energy](energy.md) through the [thermonuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) of [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) at the [core](solar%20core.md)}}, the presence and location of {{[radiative regions](radiation%20zone.md) depends on the star's [mass](mass.md)}}. Main sequence stars {{below about 0.3 [solar masses](solar%20mass.md) are entirely [convective](convection%20zone.md), meaning they do not have a radiative zone}}. From {{0.3 to 1.2 solar masses, the region around the stellar core is a radiation zone, separated from the overlying convection zone by the [tachocline](tachocline.md)}}. The radius of the radiative zone {{increases [monotonically](monotonic%20function.md) with mass, with stars around 1.2 solar masses being almost entirely radiative}}. Above {{1.2 solar masses, the core region becomes a convection zone and the overlying region is a radiation zone}}, with {{the amount of mass within the convective zone increasing with the mass of the star}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-07,58,319!2024-10-21,70,319!2024-09-26,45,299!2025-01-27,135,299!2025-02-10,139,299!2024-09-25,46,299!2024-10-26,73,319-->
