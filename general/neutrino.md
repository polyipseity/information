# neutrino

A __neutrino__ (/njuːˈtriːnoʊ/ _new-TREE-noh_; denoted by {{the Greek letter [ν](nu%20(letter).md)}}) is {{a [fermion](fermion.md) (an [elementary particle](elementary%20particlee.md) with [spin of ⁠1/2](spin-1/2.md⁠)) that interacts only via the [weak interaction](weak%20interaction.md) and [gravity](gravity.md)}}. The neutrino is so named because {{it is [electrically](electric%20charge.md) neutral and because its [rest mass](invariant%20mass.md) is so small (-ino) that it was long thought to be [zero](massless%20particle.md)}}. The rest mass of the neutrino is {{much smaller than that of the other known elementary particles (excluding massless particles)}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-25,72,310!2025-01-18,118,290!2025-01-02,108,290!2025-01-08,115,290-->
