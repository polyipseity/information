# celestial sphere

In [astronomy](astronomy.md) and [navigation](navigation.md), the __celestial sphere__ is {@{an [abstract](abstraction.md) [sphere](sphere.md) that has an arbitrarily large [radius](radius.md) and is [concentric](concentric%20objects.md) to [Earth](Earth.md)}@}.

{@{The [celestial equator](celestial%20equator.md)}@} divides the celestial sphere into {@{[northern](northern%20celestial%20sphere.md) and [southern](southern%20celestial%20sphere.md) celestial spheres}@}. Their centers are respectively {@{the north and south [celestial pole](celestial%20pole.md)}@}. {@{The position of the [Sun](Sun.md)}@} on the celestial sphere over a year is {@{the [ecliptic](ecliptic.md)}@}.

## description

Because {@{[astronomical objects](astronomical%20object.md) are so far away}@}, causally observing them {@{cannot reveal their actual distances and movement to us}@}. Thus, all astronomical objects seem {@{[equally far away](equidistant.md) and appear fixed}@}. Since {@{[Earth](Earth.md) rotates [eastward](east.md) but the celestial objects are essentially fixed}@}, the {@{sphere appears to [rotate westward](diurnal%20motion.md) overhead with Earth underfoot remaining still}@}.
