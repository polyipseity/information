# celestial sphere

In [astronomy](astronomy.md) and [navigation](navigation.md), the __celestial sphere__ is {{an [abstract](abstraction.md) [sphere](sphere.md) that has an arbitrarily large [radius](radius.md) and is [concentric](concentric%20objects.md) to [Earth](Earth.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-01,48,290-->

{{The [celestial equator](celestial%20equator.md)}} divides the celestial sphere into {{[northern](northern%20celestial%20sphere.md) and [southern](southern%20celestial%20sphere.md) celestial spheres}}. Their centers are respectively {{the north and south [celestial pole](celestial%20pole.md)}}. {{The position of the [Sun](Sun.md)}} on the celestial sphere over a year is {{the [ecliptic](ecliptic.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-17,15,290!2024-08-30,46,290!2024-09-09,56,310!2024-07-17,15,290!2024-07-18,16,290-->

## description

Because {{[astronomical objects](astronomical%20object.md) are so far away}}, causally observing them {{cannot reveal their actual distances and movement to us}}. Thus, all astronomical objects seem {{[equally far away](equidistant.md) and appear fixed}}. Since {{[Earth](Earth.md) rotates [eastward](east.md) but the celestial objects are essentially fixed}}, the {{sphere appears to [rotate westward](diurnal%20motion.md) overhead with Earth underfoot remaining still}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-17,15,290!2024-07-17,15,290!2024-08-31,48,290!2024-08-17,34,270!2024-08-14,31,270-->
