# cosmic inflation

In [physical cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md), __cosmic inflation__, __cosmological inflation__, or just __inflation__, is {{a theory of exponential [expansion of space](expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md) in the early [universe](universe.md)}}. The [inflationary epoch](inflationary%20epoch.md) is believed to have lasted {{from 10<sup>−36</sup> seconds to between 10<sup>−33</sup> and 10<sup>−32</sup> seconds after the [Big Bang](Big%20Bang.md)}}. Following the inflationary period, the universe {{continued to expand, but at a slower rate}}. {{The re-acceleration of this slowing expansion due to [dark energy](dark%20energy.md)}} began after {{the universe was already over 7.7 billion years old (5.4 billion years ago)}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,147,290!2025-01-18,92,250!2024-10-30,56,310!2024-10-29,54,310!2025-01-22,106,290-->
