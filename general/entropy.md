# entropy

## definitions and descriptions

There are two main ways to describe entropy: {{the macroscopic description from [classical thermodynamics](thermodynamics.md#classical%20thermodynamics) and the microscopic description from [statistical mechanics](statistical%20mechanics.md). The former one defines entropy based on macroscopic measurable variables like [pressure](pressure.md), [temperature](temperature.md), total [mass](mass.md), and [volume](volume.md), while the latter defines entropy based on statistics of motions of microscopic constituents in a [system](thermodynamic%20system.md)}}. Both definitions are {{consistent with each other}}. <!--SR:!2023-12-25,8,250!2024-01-02,15,290-->

> - physical analogy: {{There is no easy physical analogy for entropy. The best analogy one can make is that entropy is a [state variable](state%20variable.md) of a [thermodynamic equilibrium](thermodynamic%20equilibrium.md), similar to [internal energy](internal%20energy.md), [pressure](pressure.md), [temperature](temperature.md), [volume](volume.md), etc.}} <!--SR:!2023-12-28,10,270-->
