# triple-alpha process

- _Not to be confused with [alpha process](alpha%20process.md)._

The __triple-alpha process__ is {{a set of [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) reactions by which three [helium-4](helium-4.md) nuclei ([alpha particles](alpha%20particle.md)) are transformed into [carbon](carbon.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-04-27,201,310-->

## triple-alpha process in stars

[Helium](helium.md) {{accumulates in the [cores](stellar%20core.md) of stars}} as a result of {{the [proton–proton chain reaction](proton–proton%20chain.md) and the [carbon–nitrogen–oxygen cycle](CNO%20cycle.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-09-08,313,330!2025-09-20,324,330-->

Nuclear fusion reaction of two helium-4 nuclei {{produces [beryllium-8](beryllium-8.md), which is highly unstable, and decays back into smaller nuclei}} with {{a half-life of 8.19×10<sup>−17</sup> s}}, unless {{within that time a third alpha particle fuses with the beryllium-8 nucleus to produce an excited [resonance](resonance%20(particle%20physics).md) state of [carbon-12](carbon-12.md), called the [Hoyle state](carbon-12.md#hoyle%20state)}}, which {{nearly always decays back into three alpha particles}}, but {{once in about 2421.3 times releases energy and changes into the stable base form of carbon-12}}. When a star {{runs out of [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) to fuse in its core}}, it {{begins to contract and heat up}}. If the central temperature {{rises to 10<sup>8</sup> K, six times hotter than the Sun's core}}, alpha particles can {{fuse fast enough to get past the beryllium-8 barrier and produce significant amounts of stable carbon-12}}. <!--SR:!2025-08-25,302,330!2025-01-10,83,210!2025-04-15,167,270!2025-04-02,182,310!2025-04-02,169,270!2025-06-06,224,290!2025-01-17,115,290!2025-04-07,174,310!2025-04-29,194,310-->

The net energy release of the process is {{7.275 MeV}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-15,108,270-->

As a side effect of the process, {{some carbon nuclei fuse with additional helium to produce a stable isotope of oxygen and energy (in the form of 1 gamma ray)}} when {{the temperature rises above 2×10<sup>8</sup> K}}, called {{[_alpha capture_](alpha%20process.md)}}: <!--SR:!2025-01-04,103,290!2024-11-20,29,290!2025-03-31,179,310-->
