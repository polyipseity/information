# triple-alpha process

- _Not to be confused with [alpha process](alpha%20process.md)._

The __triple-alpha process__ is {@{a set of [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) reactions by which three [helium-4](helium-4.md) nuclei ([alpha particles](alpha%20particle.md)) are transformed into [carbon](carbon.md)}@}.

## triple-alpha process in stars

[Helium](helium.md) {@{accumulates in the [cores](stellar%20core.md) of stars}@} as a result of {@{the [proton–proton chain reaction](proton–proton%20chain.md) and the [carbon–nitrogen–oxygen cycle](CNO%20cycle.md)}@}.

Nuclear fusion reaction of two helium-4 nuclei {@{produces [beryllium-8](beryllium-8.md), which is highly unstable, and decays back into smaller nuclei}@} with {@{a half-life of 8.19×10<sup>−17</sup> s}@}, unless {@{within that time a third alpha particle fuses with the beryllium-8 nucleus to produce an excited [resonance](resonance%20(particle%20physics).md) state of [carbon-12](carbon-12.md), called the [Hoyle state](carbon-12.md#hoyle%20state)}@}, which {@{nearly always decays back into three alpha particles}@}, but {@{once in about 2421.3 times releases energy and changes into the stable base form of carbon-12}@}. When a star {@{runs out of [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) to fuse in its core}@}, it {@{begins to contract and heat up}@}. If the central temperature {@{rises to 10<sup>8</sup> K, six times hotter than the Sun's core}@}, alpha particles can {@{fuse fast enough to get past the beryllium-8 barrier and produce significant amounts of stable carbon-12}@}.

- 1st step ::@:: $${}_2^4\mathrm{He} + {}_2^4\mathrm{He} \rightarrow {}_4^8\mathrm{Be} \quad (-0.0918\mathrm{\ MeV})$$
  - 1st step / energy release ::@:: -0.0918 MeV
- 2nd step ::@:: $${}_4^8\mathrm{Be} + {}_2^4\mathrm{He} \rightarrow {}_{\phantom{0}6}^{12}\mathrm{C} + 2 \gamma \quad (+7.367\mathrm{\ MeV})$$
  - 2nd step / energy release ::@:: +7.367 MeV

The net energy release of the process is {@{7.275 MeV}@}.

As a side effect of the process, {@{some carbon nuclei fuse with additional helium to produce a stable isotope of oxygen and energy (in the form of 1 gamma ray)}@} when {@{the temperature rises above 2×10<sup>8</sup> K}@}, called {@{[_alpha capture_](alpha%20process.md)}@}:

1. [alpha capture](alpha%20process.md) ::@:: $${}_{\phantom{0}6}^{12}\mathrm{C} + {}_2^4\mathrm{He} \rightarrow {}_{\phantom{0}8}^{16}\mathrm{O} + \gamma \quad (+7.162\mathrm{\ MeV})$$
    - [alpha capture](alpha%20process.md) / energy release ::@:: +7.162 MeV

Nuclear fusion reactions of {@{helium with hydrogen produces [lithium-5](isotopes%20of%20lithium.md#lithium-5)}@}, which also is {@{highly unstable, and decays back into smaller nuclei with a half-life of 3.7×10<sup>−22</sup> s}@}.
