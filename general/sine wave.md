# sine wave

> __sine wave as a function of both space and time__
>
> {{$$y_\mp(x, t) = A \sin(kx \mp \omega t + \phi) + D$$}}
>
> where
> - {{$\mp$: negative is moving to the right, positive is moving to the left}}
> - {{$x$ is position}}
> - {{$t$ is time}}
> - {{$A$ is amplitude}}
> - {{$k$ is [wavenumber](wavenumber.md) or spatial frequency}}
> - {{$\omega$ is [angular velocity](angular%20frequency.md)}}
> - {{$\phi$ is phase offset}}
> - {{$D$ is equilibrium amplitude}}
