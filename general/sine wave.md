# sine wave

> __sine wave as a function of both space and time__
>
> {{$$y_\mp(x, t) = A \sin(kx \mp \omega t + \phi) + D$$}}
>
> where
> - [function](function%20(mathematics).md) properties: {{$y$ is [displacement](displacement%20(geometry).md) at [position](position%20(geometry).md) $x$ and [time](time.md) $t$, and for $\mp$, negative is moving to the right and positive is moving to the left}}
> - [wave](wave.md) properties: {{$A$ is [amplitude](amplitude.md), $k$ is [angular wavenumber](wavenumber.md), $\omega$ is [angular frequency](angular%20frequency.md), $\phi$ is phase offset, and $D$ is equilibrium offset}}

> [!tip] tip
>
> - adding sine waves: {{one can use [phasors](phasor.md) to help with that, i.e. adding the [phase space](phase%20space.md) [vectors](vector%20(mathematics%20and%20physics).md)}}
