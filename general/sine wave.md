# sine wave

> __sine wave as a function of both space and time__
>
> {{$$y_\mp(x, t) = A \sin(kx \mp \omega t + \phi) + D$$}}
>
> where
> - {{function properties: $y$ is amplitude at position $x$ and time $t$. and for $\mp$, negative is moving to the right, positive is moving to the left}}
> - {{wave properties: $A$ is amplitude, $k$ is [wavenumber](wavenumber.md) or spatial frequency, $\omega$ is [angular velocity](angular%20velocity.md), $\phi$ is phase offset, and $D$ is equilibrium offset}}
