The __zeroth law of thermodynamics__ states that {{if two [thermodynamic systems](thermodynamic%20system.md) A and B are in [thermal equilibrium](thermal%20equilibrium.md) with a third [thermodynamic system](thermodynamic%20system.md) C, then A and B are in [thermal equilibrium](thermal%20equilibrium.md) with each other}}. <!--SR:!2026-05-31,685,330-->
