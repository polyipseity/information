# enthalpy of vaporization

> [!tip]
>
> - enthalpy of vaporization in [vacuum](vacuum.md): {{Under lower [pressures](pressure.md), the [boiling point](boiling%20point.md) of a [liquid](liquid.md) is lower. Counterintuitively, the enthalpy of vaporization increases since the liquid has lower initial [thermal energy](thermal%20energy.md) at its [boiling point](boiling%20point.md).}}
