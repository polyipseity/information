# angular momentum

In [physics](physics.md), __angular momentum__ (sometimes called {{__moment of momentum__ or __rotational momentum__}}) is {{the [rotational](rotation.md) analog of [linear momentum](momentum.md)}}. Likewise, it is also {{a [conserved quantity](conservation%20law.md)â€“the total angular momentum of a [closed system](closed%20system.md) remains constant}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-31,33,270!2024-08-25,27,270!2024-09-09,42,290-->

## conservation of angular momentum

### general considerations

The conservation of angular momentum is used in {{analyzing [_central force motion_](classical%20central-force%20problem.md)}}. If {{the [net force](net%20force.md) on some body is directed always toward some point, the center}}, then {{there is no [torque](torque.md) on the body with respect to the center}}, as {{all of the force is directed along the [radius vector](position%20(geometry).md), and none is [perpendicular](perpendicular) to the [radius](radius.md)}}. Mathematically, torque {{$\mathbf \tau = \mathbf r \times F = \mathbf 0$, because $\mathbf r$ and $\mathbf F$ are parallel vectors}} in this case. Therefore, the angular momentum of the body {{about the center is constant}}. This is the case with {{[gravitational attraction](gravity.md) in the [orbits](orbit.md) of [planets](planet.md) and [satellites](natural%20satellite.md)}}, where {{the gravitational force is always directed toward the [primary body](primary%20body.md)}}. Intuitively, the orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by {{exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary}}. Central force motion is also used in {{the analysis of the [Bohr model](Bohr%20model.md) of the [atom](atom.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-16,48,290!2024-08-01,13,290!2024-08-03,15,290!2024-08-16,20,270!2024-08-03,15,290!2024-08-04,16,290!2024-08-21,25,270!2024-08-03,15,290!2024-07-31,12,270!2024-08-01,13,290-->
