# Newton's laws of motion

__Newton's laws of motion__ are {{three [physical laws](scientific%20law.md) that describe the relationship between the [motion](motion.md) of an object and the [forces](force.md) acting on it}}. These laws, which provide {{the basis for __Newtonian mechanics__}}, can be paraphrased as follows: <!--SR:!2024-08-02,14,290!2024-09-23,53,310-->

1. [first law](#first%20law) ::: A body remains at rest, or in [motion](motion.md) at a constant [speed](speed.md) in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a [force](force.md). <!--SR:!2024-09-08,40,290!2024-09-07,41,290-->
2. [second law](#second%20law) ::: At any instant of [time](time.md), the [net force](net%20force.md) on a body is equal to the body's [acceleration](acceleration.md) multiplied by its [mass](mass.md) or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's [momentum](momentum.md) is changing with time. <!--SR:!2024-09-14,44,290!2024-09-05,39,290-->
3. [third law](#third%20law.md) ::: If two bodies exert [forces](force.md) on each other, these forces have the same [magnitude](magnitude%20(mathematics).md) but opposite directions. <!--SR:!2024-09-02,36,290!2024-08-04,16,290-->

## laws

### first law

Newton's first law expresses {{the principle of [inertia](inertia.md): the natural behavior of a body is to move in a straight line at constant [speed](speed.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-19,23,270-->

### second law

In modern notation, the [momentum](momentum.md) of a body is {{the product of its [mass](mass.md) and its [velocity](velocity.md): $$\mathbf p = m \mathbf v$$}}, where all 3 quantities {{can change over [time](time.md) $t$}}. Newton's second law, in modern form, states that {{the [derivative](derivative.md) of the momentum is the force: $$\mathbf F = \frac {\mathrm d \mathbf p} {\mathrm dt}$$}}. If {{mass $m$ does not change over time}}, then {{the derivative acts only on the velocity}}, and so {{the force equals the product of the mass and the time derivative of velocity, which is [acceleration](acceleration.md): $$\mathbf F = m \frac {\mathrm d \mathbf v} {\mathrm dt} = m \mathbf a$$}}. As acceleration is also {{the second time derivative of position}}, the above equation can also be written as: {{$$\mathbf F = m \frac {\mathrm d^2 \mathbf s} {\mathrm dt^2}$$}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-04,16,290!2024-08-05,17,290!2024-08-03,15,290!2024-08-03,15,290!2024-09-15,45,290!2024-09-17,47,290!2024-08-04,16,290!2024-09-24,54,310-->

### third law

Newton's third law relates to {{a more fundamental principle, the [conservation of momentum](momentum.md#conservation)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-01,35,290-->
