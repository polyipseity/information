# beat (acoustics)

## mathematics and physics of beat tones

Consider two [sine waves](sine%20wave.md) with different [frequencies](frequency.md) $f_1$ and $f_2$ [superimposed](superposition%20principle.md): {@{$\cos(2\pi f_1 t) + \cos(2\pi f_2 t) = 2 \cos\left(2\pi \frac{f_1 + f_2}2 t\right) \cos\left(2\pi \frac{f_1 - f_2}2 t\right)$}@}. If $f_1$ and $f_2$ are close, the frequency of the second cosine $\lvert \frac{f_1 - f_2}2 \rvert$ is {@{too low to be perceived as a [pitch](pitch%20(music).md) but instead an [amplitude](amplitude.md) [modulation](modulation.md) of the first cosine}@}. Since a beat happens {@{whenever the amplitude reaches minimum or maximum, the audible beat frequency is twice the modulation frequency: $f_\text{beat} = \lvert f_1 - f_2 \rvert$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-12-24,780,290!2026-01-15,532,310!2026-09-22,771,330-->
