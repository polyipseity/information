# Sun

## motion

- see: [stellar kinematics](stellar%20kinematics.md)

Being {{part of the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md) galaxy}}, the Sun with the whole [Solar System](Solar%20System.md), moves in {{an [orbital](orbit.md) fashion around the galaxy's center of mass at an average speed of 230 km/s (828&nbsp;000 km/h) or 143 mi/s (514&nbsp;000 mph)}}, taking {{about 220â€“250 million [Earth](Earth.md) years to complete a revolution (a Galactic year)}}, having done so {{about 20 times since the Sun's formation}}. The direction of the Sun's motion {{relative to the [local standard of rest](local%20standard%20of%20rest.md) (so the orbital motion is excluded), the [solar apex](solar%20apex.md), is roughly in the direction of the star [Vega](Vega.md) at about 13.4 km/s}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-17,17,290!2024-07-17,6,250!2024-07-16,16,290!2024-08-25,42,290!2024-07-15,6,250-->
