## importance

It is extremely important to {@{know your customers}@}. {@{Without customers}@}, no business can survive. One of the purpose of a business is to {@{create and keep customers}@}. For example, in biotechnology, understanding {@{patents}@} is important. <!--SR:!2025-09-10,358,310!2024-11-16,142,290!2026-01-03,450,310!2025-04-08,255,330-->

When defining customers, one should avoid {@{vagueness}@}. To avoid it, some factors to consider are {@{disposable income, lifestyles, reasons for choosing your product}@}, etc. <!--SR:!2025-07-20,312,290!2025-06-11,256,270-->

## the four-step process

### customer discovery

Discovering and defining your customer segments is important so that {@{the market size can be accurately estimated}@}. Also, they affect {@{your products' properties}@}. Customer segments can be broadly classified into {@{mass market, a large group with broadly similar needs; niche market, a small group with specific needs; and in the middle of the road, segmented market, different groups with different needs}@}. In terms of profits, {@{mass market has lower profit margins but higher volume, while the opposite is true for niche market}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-09,160,310!2024-11-17,132,290!2025-10-22,361,270!2025-04-27,225,270-->

One can create {@{a customer profile that shows a typical person}@} for each customer segment. The profile lists {@{the customer information, jobs, pains, and gains}@}. Note that in a customer segment, users of the product {@{might not be the buyers, such as children buying stuff for elderly}@}. In that case, {@{the buyer should have a customer profile as well}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-11,235,330!2025-07-08,260,250!2025-03-05,218,290!2025-03-23,225,310-->

> [!example] examples
>
> - customers of a service selling meal plans to elderly ::@:: Buyers: Children of the elderly, as the elderly are unlikely to know how to use the service by themselves. Users: Elderly. <!--SR:!2025-06-12,308,330!2025-01-13,188,310-->

### customer validation

After [customer discovery](#customer%20discovery), we need to do {@{customer validation}@}. The goal of customer validation is to {@{determine whether your product should be created in the first place}@}. Even if yor customer profile is accurate, {@{the customer might not use your products anyway when put into actual practice}@}. This is because {@{most customer do not switch to a new product unless the gain outweighs the perceived loss from switching from an existing product}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-03,156,310!2025-11-26,422,310!2025-02-27,210,290!2026-01-24,444,290-->

To validate your customers, {@{interact with your customers, such as talking to them, showing them your product prototype}@}, etc. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,212,270-->

> [!example] examples
>
> - Old people are unhappy. Is it because they cannot move around easily? ::@:: Maybe... but the lack of mobility is only one of the factors contributing to their greatest pain, loneliness. <!--SR:!2025-12-24,442,310!2025-03-06,231,330-->
