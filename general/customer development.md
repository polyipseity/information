# customer development

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../tools/utility.py.md
```

## importance

It is extremely important to {{know your customers}}. {{Without customers}}, no business can survive. One of the purpose of a business is to {{create and keep customers}}. For example, in biotechnology, understanding {{patents}} is important. <!--SR:!2024-09-17,89,290!2024-11-16,142,290!2024-10-09,112,290!2024-07-24,59,310-->

When defining customers, one should avoid {{vagueness}}. To avoid it, some factors to consider are {{disposable income, lifestyles, reasons for choosing your product}}, etc. <!--SR:!2024-09-11,83,270!2024-09-28,95,270-->

## the four-step process

### customer discovery

Discovering and defining your customer segments is important so that {{the market size can be accurately estimated}}. Also, they affect {{your products' properties}}. Customer segments can be broadly classified into {{mass market, a large group with broadly similar needs; niche market, a small group with specific needs; and in the middle of the road, segmented market, different groups with different needs}}. In terms of profits, {{mass market has lower profit margins but higher volume, while the opposite is true for niche market}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-09,160,310!2024-11-17,132,290!2024-07-14,42,250!2024-09-14,83,270-->

One can create {{a customer profile that shows a typical person}} for each customer segment. The profile lists {{the customer information, jobs, pains, and gains}}. Note that in a customer segment, users of the product {{might not be the buyers, such as children buying stuff for elderly}}. In that case, {{the buyer should have a customer profile as well}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,55,310!2024-07-10,41,250!2024-07-30,58,270!2024-08-09,73,310-->

> [!example] examples
>
> - customers of a service selling meal plans to elderly ::: Buyers: Children of the elderly, as the elderly are unlikely to know how to use the service by themselves. Users: Elderly. <!--SR:!2024-08-08,72,310!2024-07-09,47,290-->

### customer validation

After [customer discovery](#customer%20discovery), we need to do {{customer validation}}. The goal of customer validation is to {{determine whether your product should be created in the first place}}. Even if yor customer profile is accurate, {{the customer might not use your products anyway when put into actual practice}}. This is because {{most customer do not switch to a new product unless the gain outweighs the perceived loss from switching from an existing product}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-03,156,310!2024-09-30,105,290!2024-07-31,56,270!2024-07-11,44,270-->

To validate your customers, {{interact with your customers, such as talking to them, showing them your product prototype}}, etc. <!--SR:!2024-09-05,79,270-->

> [!example] examples
>
> - Old people are unhappy. Is it because they cannot move around easily? ::: Maybe... but the lack of mobility is only one of the factors contributing to their greatest pain, loneliness. <!--SR:!2024-10-06,110,290!2024-07-18,54,310-->
