# squeeze theorem

## statement

> __squeeze theorem__
>
> 1. {@{Let $I$ be an [interval](interval%20(mathematics).md) containing $a$ (or with $a$ as an endpoint for one-sided limit and limit at infinity). Let $l$, $f$, and $u$ be [functions](function%20(mathematics).md) defined on $I$, except possibly at $a$.}@}
> 2. {@{If $\lim_{x\to{}a}l(x)=\lim_{x\to{}a}u(x)=L$, and $l(x)\le{f(x)}\le{u(x)}$ for all $x\in{I}$ except possibly at $a$, then $\lim_{x\to{}a}f(x)=L$. (The limits become one-sided if $a$ is an endpoint of $I$.)}@}
