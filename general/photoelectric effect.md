# photoelectric effect

The __photoelectric effect__ is {{the ejection of [electrons](electron.md) from a material when [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) strikes it}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-26,293,230-->

## observation

A {{[photocell](photocell.md)}} can be used to observe the effect. It consists of {{a [photocathode](photocathode.md), curving around an [anode](anode.md) inside an [evacuated](vacuum.md) glass tube}}. When the photocathode is shone by light, {{emitted electrons escape to the anode}}, {{producing an [electric current](electric%20current.md)}}. The current is called {{photoelectric current, a kind of [photocurrent](photocurrent.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-05,377,290!2024-03-25,177,230!2024-01-25,259,270!2024-01-29,242,230!2024-05-17,383,290-->

If the light frequency is lower than the {{threshold frequency}}, {{no photoemission occurs}}. Otherwise, {{immediate photoemission occurs}}. {{Light [intensity](intensity.md) or duration of exposure}} does not affect photoemission of a single electron. {{Light intensity}} only affects the photoelectric current. <!--SR:!2027-05-27,1273,350!2024-09-22,488,310!2024-09-06,432,290!2024-01-04,257,270!2024-02-22,319,290-->

Emitted electrons have {{different}} initial kinetic energies. The maximum kinetic energy of an electron {{increases with light frequency}} given that the threshold frequency is exceeded. <!--SR:!2026-02-07,882,330!2024-03-19,286,270-->

## mechanism

The classical [wave model](electromagnetic%20radiation.md#wave%20model) predicts that when {{continuous radiation passes through an electron}}, {{the electron gains [kinetic energy](kinentic%20energy.md)}}, {{vibrating with increasing amplitude}}. After {{some time}}, when enough energy is accumulated, {{the electron is emitted}}. The energy gain increases when {{light intensity increases}}. However, {{[observations](#observation) disagree}}. <!--SR:!2023-12-18,132,230!2024-07-29,418,270!2026-04-04,917,330!2024-06-01,392,290!2025-04-19,511,270!2024-06-05,395,290!2023-12-26,253,270-->

The {{threshold frequency $\nu_o$}} is determined by {{the [work function](work%20function.md) $\Phi$ of the surface of the material}}:
{{$\begin{aligned}\Phi&=h\nu_o\\\nu_o&=\frac\Phi{h}\end{aligned}$}}
where {{$h$ is the [Planck constant](Planck%20constant.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-09-18,713,282!2024-04-07,326,282!2025-08-15,742,330!2027-01-23,1168,342-->

The {{maximum kinetic energy $K_\mathrm{max}$}} is determined by {{the frequency $f$ of the incoming photon and the work function $\Phi$ of the surface of the material}}:
{{$$K_\mathrm{max}=hf-\Phi=hf-hV_o=h\left(f-V_o\right)$$}}
where {{$h$ is the Planck constant}}. <!--SR:!2026-01-26,887,341!2024-02-12,284,281!2025-08-10,734,321!2025-11-02,758,341-->

Given the threshold frequency is reached, increasing intensity only {{increases the number of [photons](photon.md) hitting the surface}}, {{increasing photoemission}}, {{hence photoelectric current}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-09,453,242!2024-05-03,362,290!2025-07-22,697,310-->
