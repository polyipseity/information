# optical telescope

## characteristics

### angular resolution

Ignoring {{blurring of the image by turbulence in the atmosphere ([atmospheric seeing](astronomical%20seeing.md)) and optical imperfections of the telescope}}, the [angular resolution](angular%20resolution.md) of an optical telescope is determined by {{the diameter of the [primary mirror](primary%20mirror.md) or lens gathering the light (also termed its "aperture")}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-23,43,290!2024-10-12,61,310-->

{{The [Rayleigh criterion](angular%20resolution.md#Rayleigh's%20criterion)}} for the resolution limit {{$\alpha_R$ (in radians)}} is given by {{$$\sin(\alpha_R) = 1.22 \frac \lambda D \qquad (\text{note that }\sin(\alpha_R) \approx \alpha_R\text{ for small }\alpha_R)$$}}, where {{$\lambda$ is the [wavelength](wavelength.md) and $D$ is the aperture}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-19,68,310!2024-09-14,37,290!2024-10-14,63,310!2024-10-13,62,310-->

### light-gathering power

- see: [etendue](etendue.md)

The light-gathering power of an optical telescope, also referred to as {{light grasp or aperture gain}}, is {{the ability of a telescope to collect a lot more [light](light.md) than the [human eye](human%20eye.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-22,42,290!2024-09-06,29,270-->

It is proportional to {{square of the aperture $D$}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-08,58,310-->
