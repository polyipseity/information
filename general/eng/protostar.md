# protostar

A __protostar__ is {@{a very young [star](star.md) that is still gathering mass from its parent [molecular cloud](molecular%20cloud.md)}@}. It is {@{the earliest phase}@} in the process of [stellar evolution](stellar%20evolution.md). For {@{a low-mass star (i.e. that of the [Sun](sun.md) or lower)}@}, it lasts {@{about 500&nbsp;000 years}@}. The phase begins when {@{a molecular cloud fragment first collapses under the force of self-[gravity](gravity.md) and an opaque, pressure-supported core forms inside the collapsing fragment}@}. It ends when {@{the infalling gas is depleted, leaving a [pre-main-sequence star](pre-main-sequence%20star.md)}@}, which {@{contracts to later become a [main-sequence star](main%20sequence.md) at the onset of [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) [fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) producing [helium](helium.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-12-01,649,330!2029-01-06,1260,350!2025-10-30,339,310!2027-06-03,750,290!2028-05-06,1024,310!2027-09-28,867,330!2027-07-20,823,330-->
