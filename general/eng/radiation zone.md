# radiation zone

A __radiation zone__, or __radiative region__ is {@{a layer of a [star](star.md)'s interior (though not necessarily the core) where [energy](energy.md) is primarily transported toward the exterior by means of [radiative diffusion](radiation.md) and [thermal conduction](thermal%20conduction.md), rather than by [convection](convection%20(heat%20transfer).md)}@}. Energy travels through the radiation zone {@{in the form of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) as [photons](photon.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-17,365,290!2025-08-02,308,330-->

## main sequence stars

For [main sequence](main%20sequence.md) [stars](star.md)â€”those stars that are {@{generating [energy](energy.md) through the [thermonuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) of [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) at the [core](solar%20core.md)}@}, the presence and location of {@{[radiative regions](radiation%20zone.md) depends on the star's [mass](mass.md)}@}. Main sequence stars {@{below about 0.3 [solar masses](solar%20mass.md) are entirely [convective](convection%20zone.md), meaning they do not have a radiative zone}@}. From {@{0.3 to 1.2 solar masses, the region around the stellar core is a radiation zone, separated from the overlying convection zone by the [tachocline](tachocline.md)}@}. The radius of the radiative zone {@{increases [monotonically](monotonic%20function.md) with mass, with stars around 1.2 solar masses being almost entirely radiative}@}. Above {@{1.2 solar masses, the core region becomes a convection zone and the overlying region is a radiation zone}@}, with {@{the amount of mass within the convective zone increasing with the mass of the star}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-23,855,339!2025-06-06,228,319!2026-08-20,559,319!2025-10-21,196,279!2026-04-01,415,299!2026-03-31,413,299!2025-06-15,232,319-->
