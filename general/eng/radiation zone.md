# radiation zone

{@{A __radiation zone__, or __radiative region__}@} is {@{a layer of a [star](star.md)'s interior \(though not necessarily the core\)}@} where [energy](energy.md) is primarily {@{transported toward the exterior by means of [radiative diffusion](radiation.md) and [thermal conduction](thermal%20conduction.md)}@}, rather than {@{by [convection](convection%20(heat%20transfer).md)}@}. {@{Energy travels}@} through the radiation zone in the form of {@{[electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) as [photons](photon.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2030-01-03,1478,310!2029-06-03,1401,350!2026-01-21,70,345!2026-01-22,71,345!2026-01-20,69,345!2026-01-21,70,345-->

## main sequence stars

For {@{[main sequence](main%20sequence.md) [stars](star.md)}@}—those stars that are {@{generating [energy](energy.md) through the [thermonuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) of [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) at the [core](solar%20core.md)}@}, {@{the presence and location}@} of [radiative regions](radiation%20zone.md) depends on {@{the star's [mass](mass.md)}@}. Main sequence stars {@{below about 0.3 [solar masses](solar%20mass.md)}@} are {@{entirely [convective](convection%20zone.md), meaning they do not have a radiative zone}@}. From {@{0.3 to 1.2 solar masses}@}, the region around {@{the stellar core is a radiation zone}@}, separated from {@{the overlying convection zone by the [tachocline](tachocline.md)}@}. The radius of the radiative zone {@{increases [monotonically](monotonic%20function.md) with mass}@}, with stars around {@{1.2 solar masses being almost entirely radiative}@}. Above {@{1.2 solar masses}@}, the core region becomes {@{a convection zone and the overlying region is a radiation zone}@}, with {@{the amount of mass within the convective zone increasing with the mass of the star}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-23,855,339!2028-03-03,1001,339!2026-08-20,559,319!2026-01-29,100,259!2026-04-01,415,299!2026-03-31,413,299!2027-06-21,736,319!2026-09-03,242,344!2026-05-26,166,324!2026-01-29,77,345!2026-01-30,78,345!2026-01-30,78,345!2026-08-16,224,345!2026-01-29,77,345-->
