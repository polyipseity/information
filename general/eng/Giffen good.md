In {@{[microeconomics](microeconomics.md) and [consumer theory](consumer%20choice.md)}@}, {@{a __Giffen good__}@} is {@{a product that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa}@}, violating {@{the [law of demand](law%20of%20demand.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-24,75,329!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-07,59,310!2025-02-15,67,310-->

By contrast, a Giffen good is {@{so strongly an [inferior good](inferior%20good.md) \(in higher demand at lower incomes\)}@} that {@{the contrary income effect more than offsets the substitution effect}@}, and {@{the net effect of the good's price rise is to increase demand for it}@}.

Giffen goods are {@{named after Scottish economist [Sir Robert Giffen](Robert%20Giffen.md)}@}, to whom {@{[Alfred Marshall](Alfred%20Marshall.md)}@} attributed this idea in {@{his book _[Principles of Economics](Principles%20of%20Economics%20(Marshall%20book).md)_}@}, first {@{published in 1890}@}. Giffen first {@{proposed the [paradox](paradox.md)}@} from {@{his observations of the purchasing habits of the [Victorian era](Victorian%20era.md) poor}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-02,56,310!2025-01-20,46,290!2025-02-06,58,310!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-12,64,310-->

It has been suggested by {@{Etsusuke Masuda and [Peter Newman](Peter%20Kenneth%20Newman.md)}@} that {@{Simon Gray described "Gray goods"}@} in {@{his 1815 text entitled _The Happiness of States: Or An Inquiry Concerning Population, The Modes of Subsisting and Employing It, and the Effects of All on Human Happiness_}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {@{The chapter entitled _A Rise in the Price of Bread Corn, beyond a certain Pitch, tends to increase the Consumption of it,_}@} contains {@{a detailed account of what have come to be called Giffen goods}@}, and which might {@{better be called Gray goods}@}. They also note that {@{[George Stigler](George%20Stigler.md)}@} corrected {@{Marshall's misattribution}@} in {@{a 1947 journal article on the history}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-01-05,31,270!2025-01-31,54,310!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-08,60,310!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-12,64,310-->

## analysis

For {@{almost all products}@}, {@{the demand curve has a negative slope}@}: {@{as the price increases, quantity demanded for the good decreases}@}. \(See [Supply and demand](supply%20and%20demand.md) for background.\) <!--SR:!2025-02-13,65,310!2025-02-02,56,310!2025-02-08,60,310-->

Giffen goods are {@{the exception to this general rule}@}. Unlike {@{other goods or services}@}, {@{the price point at which supply and demand meet results in higher prices and greater demand}@} whenever {@{market forces recognize a change in supply and demand for Giffen goods}@}. As a result, when {@{price goes up, the quantity demanded also goes up}@}. To be {@{a true Giffen good}@}, {@{the good's price}@} must be {@{the only thing that changes to produce a change in quantity demanded}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-13,65,310!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-01,55,310!2025-02-06,58,310!2025-02-10,62,310!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-10,62,310-->

Giffen goods {@{should not be confused with [Veblen goods](Veblen%20good.md)}@}: Veblen goods are {@{products whose demand increases if their price increases because the price is seen as an indicator of _quality_ or _status_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-01-18,44,290-->

{@{The classic example given by Marshall}@} is {@{of inferior quality [staple foods](staple%20food.md)}@}, whose demand is {@{driven by [poverty](poverty.md) that makes their purchasers unable to afford superior foodstuffs}@}. As {@{the price of the cheap staple rises}@}, they can {@{no longer afford to supplement their diet with better foods}@}, and {@{must consume more of the staple food}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-12,64,310!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-08,60,310!2025-02-05,57,310!2025-02-10,62,310!2025-02-01,55,310-->

> As {@{Mr. Giffen has pointed out}@}, {@{a rise in the price of bread}@} makes {@{so large a drain on the resources of the poorer labouring families}@} and {@{raises the marginal utility of money to them so much}@} that {@{they are forced to curtail their consumption of meat and the more expensive farinaceous foods}@}: and, {@{bread being still the cheapest food which they can get and will take}@}, they {@{consume more, and not less of it}@}.

There are {@{three necessary conditions for this situation to arise}@}:<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-06,58,310-->

1. the good in question ::@:: must be an [inferior good](inferior%20good.md), <!--SR:!2025-02-11,63,310!2025-02-05,57,310-->
2. there must be a lack of ::@:: close [substitute goods](substitute%20good.md), and <!--SR:!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-02,56,310-->
3. the goods must constitute ::@:: a substantial percentage of the buyer's income, but not such a substantial percentage of the buyer's income that none of the associated [normal goods](normal%20good.md) are consumed. <!--SR:!2025-02-25,76,329!2025-02-14,66,310-->

If {@{precondition \#1 is changed to "The goods in question must be so inferior that the income effect is greater than the substitution effect"}@} then {@{this list defines necessary and sufficient conditions}@}. {@{The last condition}@} is {@{a condition on the buyer rather than the goods itself}@}, and thus {@{the phenomenon is also called a "Giffen behavior"}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-12,64,310!2025-02-24,75,329!2025-01-21,47,290!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-02-07,59,310-->

## examples

Suppose {@{a consumer has a budget of \$6 per day that they spend on food}@}. They must {@{eat three meals a day}@}, and there are {@{only two options for them}@}: {@{the inferior good, bread, which costs \$1 per meal, and the superior good, cake, which costs \$4 per meal}@}. Cake is {@{always preferable to bread}@}. At present, the consumer would {@{purchase 2 loaves of bread and one cake}@}, {@{completely exhausting their budget to fill 3 meals each day}@}. Now, if {@{the price of bread were to rise from \$1 to \$2}@}, then the consumer would {@{have no choice but to give up cake}@}, and {@{spend their entire budget on 3 loaves of bread, in order to eat three meals a day}@}. In this situation, {@{their consumption of bread would have actually increased}@} as a result of {@{the price increase}@}. Thus {@{bread would be a Giffen good in this example}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-02-11,63,310!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-12,64,310!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-02-12,64,310!2025-02-06,58,310!2025-02-13,65,310!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-25,76,329!2025-02-03,57,310!2025-02-09,61,310!2025-02-08,60,310-->

{@{Investor [Rob Arnott](Robert%20D.%20Arnott.md) said in 2021}@} that {@{the [stock market](stock%20market.md) is a Giffen good}@}. {@{Widespread interest in the market}@} tends to {@{increase during periods of rising prices for stocks}@} and {@{decrease during market crashes}@}, which is {@{contrary to ideal investing practices}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-01-22,43,290!2025-02-13,65,310!2025-02-24,75,329!2025-02-05,57,310!2025-02-25,76,329!2025-02-01,55,310-->

## empirical evidence

{@{Evidence for the existence of Giffen goods}@} has {@{generally been limited}@}. {@{A 2008 paper}@} by {@{Robert Jensen and Nolan Miller}@} argued {@{[rice](rice.md) and [wheat](wheat.md) [noodles](noodle.md) were Giffen goods in parts of [China](china.md)}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> {@{Another 2008 paper}@} by the same authors {@{experimentally demonstrated the existence of Giffen goods among people at the household level}@} by {@{directly subsidizing purchases of rice and wheat flour for extremely poor families}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> In this paper, {@{the field experiment conducted in 2007}@} consisted of {@{the province of Hunan, where rice is a dietary staple, and the province of Gansu, where wheat is a staple}@}. In both provinces, {@{random households were selected}@} and were {@{offered their dietary staple at subsidized rates}@}. After {@{the completion of the project}@}, it could be found that {@{the demands from Hunan households who were offered the rice fell drastically}@}. Meanwhile, {@{the demands of wheat in Gansu implies weak evidence of the Giffen paradox}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-13,65,310!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-02-06,58,310!2025-02-25,76,329!2025-02-25,76,329!2025-02-05,57,310!2025-02-11,63,310!2025-02-01,55,310!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-02-13,65,310!2025-02-12,64,310!2025-02-09,61,310!2025-02-13,65,310!2025-01-19,45,290!2025-02-04,55,309-->

In {@{1991, Battalio, Kagel, and Kogut}@} published an article arguing that {@{quinine water is a Giffen good for some lab rats}@}. However, they were {@{only able to show the existence of a Giffen good at an individual level and not the market level}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-01-25,46,290!2025-02-09,61,310!2025-02-13,65,310!2025-02-05,57,310-->

Giffen goods are {@{difficult to study}@} because {@{the definition requires a number of observable conditions}@}. {@{One reason for the difficulty in studying market demand for Giffen goods}@} is that Giffen {@{originally envisioned a specific situation faced by individuals in poverty}@}. {@{Modern [consumer behaviour](consumer%20behaviour.md) research methods}@} often {@{deal in aggregates that average out income levels}@}, and are {@{too blunt an instrument to capture these specific situations}@}. Complicating the matter are {@{the requirements that availability of substitutes be limited and that consumers be not so poor that they can only afford the inferior good}@}. For this reason, {@{many text books use the term _Giffen paradox_ rather than _Giffen good_}@}.<!-- <sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> --> <!--SR:!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-02-24,75,329!2025-02-10,62,310!2025-01-24,45,290!2025-02-12,64,310!2025-02-02,56,310!2025-02-24,75,329!2025-02-03,57,310-->

{@{Some types of premium goods}@} \(such as {@{expensive French wines, or celebrity-endorsed perfumes}@}\) are {@{sometimes called Giffen goods}@} via {@{the claim that lowering the price of these high-status goods decreases demand because they are no longer perceived as exclusive or high-status products}@}. However, to the extent that {@{the perceived nature of such high-status goods actually changes significantly with a substantial price drop}@}, this behavior {@{disqualifies them from being considered Giffen goods}@}, because the Giffen goods analysis {@{assumes that only the consumer's income or the relative price level changes}@}, not {@{the nature of the good itself}@}. If {@{a price change modifies consumers' perception of the good}@}, they should be {@{analysed as [Veblen goods](Veblen%20good.md)}@}. Some economists<!-- <sup>\[_[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual%20of%20Style/Words%20to%20watch#Unsupported%20attributions)_\]</sup> --> question {@{the empirical validity of the distinction between Giffen and Veblen goods}@}, arguing that {@{whenever there is a substantial change in the price of a good its perceived nature also changes}@}, since {@{price is a large part of what constitutes a [product](product%20(business).md)}@}. <sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> However, {@{the theoretical distinction between the two types of analysis remains clear}@}, and {@{which one should apply to any actual case is an empirical matter}@}. Based on {@{microeconomic consumer theory}@}, it assumes that {@{the consumer could value a good without knowing the price}@}. However, when {@{the consumers who were constrained by income and price need to choose the optimal goods}@}, the goods {@{must be valued with available prices}@}. Because, in some degrees, the higher price indicates {@{higher values of goods offering to the consumers}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-13,65,310!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-09,61,310!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-05,57,310!2025-02-12,64,310!2025-02-24,75,329!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-01-31,54,310!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-02-10,62,310!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-03,57,310!2025-01-18,41,290!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-14,66,310-->

### Great Famine in Ireland

{@{Potatoes during the Irish [Great Famine](Great%20Famine%20(Ireland).md)}@} were {@{once considered to be an example of a Giffen good}@}. Along with the Famine, the price of {@{potatoes and meat increased subsequently}@}. Compared to meat, it is obvious that {@{potatoes could be much cheaper as a staple food}@}. Due to {@{poverty}@}, individuals {@{could not afford meat anymore}@}; therefore, {@{demand for potatoes increased}@}. Under such a situation, {@{the supply curve will increase with the rise in potatoes' price}@}, which is {@{consistent with the definition of Giffen good}@}. However, {@{Gerald P. Dwyer and Cotton M. Lindsey}@} {@{challenged this idea}@} in {@{their 1984 article _Robert Giffen and the Irish Potato_}@},<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup><sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> where they showed {@{the contradicting nature of the Giffen "legend" with respect to historical evidence}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-12,64,310!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-13,65,310!2025-02-07,59,310!2025-02-12,64,310!2025-02-13,65,310!2025-02-08,60,310!2025-02-03,57,310!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-01-05,31,270!2025-02-13,65,310!2025-01-24,45,290!2025-02-14,66,310-->

{@{The Giffen nature of the Irish potato}@} was also {@{later discredited}@} by {@{[Sherwin Rosen](Sherwin%20Rosen.md) of the [University of Chicago](University%20of%20Chicago.md)}@} in {@{his 1999 paper _Potato Paradoxes_}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> Rosen showed that {@{the phenomenon could be explained by a normal [demand](supply%20and%20demand.md) model}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-04,58,310!2025-02-12,64,310!2025-01-31,51,309!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-07,59,310-->

{@{Charles Read}@} has shown {@{with quantitative evidence that [bacon](bacon.md) pigs showed Giffen-style behaviour}@} during the Irish Famine, but {@{that potatoes did not}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup><sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-01-26,47,290!2025-02-04,58,310-->

### other proposed examples

{@{Anthony Bopp \(1983\)}@} proposed that {@{[kerosene](kerosene.md), a low-quality fuel used in home heating}@}, was a Giffen good. {@{Schmuel Baruch and Yakar Kanai \(2001\)}@} suggested that {@{_[shochu](shōchū.md)_, a Japanese distilled beverage}@}, could be a Giffen good. In both cases, the authors {@{offered supporting econometric evidence}@}. However, {@{this evidence is considered incomplete}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-05,31,270!2025-01-25,46,290!2025-02-25,68,270!2025-02-09,61,310!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-11,63,310-->

It is worth noting that {@{a good may be a Giffen good at the individual level but not at the aggregate level \(or vice-versa\)}@}. As shown by {@{Hildenbrand's model}@}, aggregate demand will {@{not necessarily exhibit any Giffen behavior even when we assume the same preferences for each consumer}@}, whose {@{nominal wealth is uniformly distributed on an interval containing zero}@}. This could explain {@{the presence of Giffen behavior for individual consumers but the absence in aggregate data}@}.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-01-05,31,270!2025-01-31,54,310!2025-02-25,76,329!2025-01-19,42,290!2025-02-14,66,310-->

5. Arnott stated: 'Bargains \[with investing\] got there by inflicting pain and losses. Nobody wants to double down on pain and losses. The result is that the stock market is a classic Giffen good. A Giffen good is something where demanding \[sic\] increases as the price goes up. Common examples are jewelry or fashion, high fashion clothes. A designer dress for \$1,000 dollars isn’t going to sell, a designer dress for \$10,000 will. And same thing applies to the stock market. Economists are reluctant to treat stocks and bonds as Giffen goods, but they are. Demand goes up as the price goes up. It’s a little bit like if Tiffany’s had a banner sign saying post-COVID sales, everything marked up 20% and people were breaking down the doors to get in and Cartier across the street, post-COVID sales, everything marked down 20% and people think, “Oh, they’ve got something wrong with their product. I’m not going in there.”' As quoted in The Meb Faber Show, [Episode \#313: Rob Arnott, Research Affiliates, “Modern Monetary Theory Does Not Work"](https://mebfaber.com/2021/05/19/e313-rob-arnott/), May 19, 2021 <a id="^ref-5"></a>^ref-5
