# photodisintegration

{@{__Photodisintegration__ (also called __phototransmutation__, or a __photonuclear reaction__)}@} is {@{a [nuclear process](nuclear%20reaction.md) in which an [atomic nucleus](atomic%20nucleus.md) absorbs a high-energy [gamma ray](gamma%20ray.md), enters an excited state, and immediately decays by emitting a subatomic particle}@}. The incoming gamma ray {@{effectively knocks one or more [neutrons](neutron.md), [protons](proton.md), or an [alpha particle](alpha%20particle.md) out of the nucleus}@}. The reactions are called {@{(γ,n), (γ,p), and (γ,α)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-12-19,1247,350!2027-02-23,702,330!2027-01-23,680,330!2026-01-02,361,310-->
