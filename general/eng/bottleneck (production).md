In {@{[production](production%20(economics).md) and [project management](project%20management.md)}@}, {@{a __bottleneck__}@} is {@{a process in a chain of processes, such that its limited capacity reduces the capacity of the whole chain}@}. {@{The result of having a bottleneck}@} are {@{stalls in production, supply overstock, pressure from customers, and low employee morale}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> There are {@{both short and long-term bottlenecks}@}. {@{Short-term bottlenecks}@} are {@{temporary and are not normally a significant problem}@}. An example of a short-term bottleneck would be {@{a skilled employee taking a few days off}@}. {@{Long-term bottlenecks}@} {@{occur all the time and can cumulatively significantly slow down production}@}. An example of a long-term bottleneck is {@{when a machine is not efficient enough and as a result has a long queue}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290-->

An example is {@{the lack of [smelter](smelter.md) and [refinery](refining%20(metallurgy).md) supply}@} which {@{cause bottlenecks upstream}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290-->

Another example is in {@{a [surface-mount technology](surface-mount%20technology.md) board assembly line with several pieces of equipment aligned}@}. Usually the common sense strategy is to {@{set up and shift the bottleneck element towards the end of the process}@}, inducing {@{the better and faster machines}@} to {@{always keep the [printed circuit board](printed%20circuit%20board.md) \(PCB\) supply flowing up}@}, never {@{allowing the slower ones to fully stop}@}; a strategy that could {@{result in a deleterious \(or damaging\) and significant, overall drawback in the process}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,11,270!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290-->

## identifying bottlenecks

> {@{![Cycle of identifying, managing and preventing bottlenecks in production](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-03%20at%201.46.58%20pm.png)}@}

> Cycle of {@{identifying, managing and preventing bottlenecks in production}@} <!--SR:!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290-->

{@{Almost every system}@} has {@{a bottleneck, even if it is a minor one}@}. If {@{every system was running at full capacity}@}, {@{at least one machine would be accumulating processes}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> Identifying bottlenecks is {@{critical for improving efficiency in the production line}@} because it allows you to {@{determine the area where accumulation occurs}@}. {@{The machine or process that accumulates the longest queue}@} is {@{usually a bottleneck, however this isn't always the case}@}. Bottlenecks can be found through: {@{identifying the areas where accumulation occurs, evaluating the throughput}@}, {@{assessing whether each machine is being used at full capacity, and finding the machine with the high wait time}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup><sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-06,12,270!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290-->

### accumulation

When {@{input comes in faster than the speed of the process}@}, {@{accumulation starts to occur}@}. This means that the machine either {@{does not have enough capacity, is not being fully utilized or has an under-qualified operator}@}. This method is {@{not effective at identifying bottlenecks where the queues are at several process steps}@}, as {@{there are multiple processes with accumulation}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290-->

### throughput

Since the production line is {@{directly linked to the output of the machines}@}, it allows for {@{the identifying of the main bottleneck in the manufacturing process}@}. In {@{changing each machines throughput}@}, it will be possible to {@{assess which machine affects the overall output the most}@}, and hence {@{determine the bottleneck in the chain of processes}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-06,12,270!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-10,15,290-->

### full capacity

By using {@{the utilization percentage of each production unit}@}, it is possible to {@{determine the machine which uses the highest percentage of its capacity}@}. {@{This machine is bottlenecking the other machines}@} by {@{'forcing' them to operate at a lower capacity}@}. However, if {@{all machines in the chain of processes are running at a similar capacity level}@}, {@{increasing the capacity of the lowest machine}@} will {@{not create a significant improvement to the total output}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290-->

### wait times

In the case where {@{several production units are already running at full capacity}@}, {@{tracking the down time of machines}@} will allow you to {@{identify which machine is being bottlenecked}@}. Usually {@{the machine prior the machine with the highest wait or down time}@} in the chain of processes is {@{a bottleneck}@}. The result of this is {@{a machine being under utilized}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290-->

{@{A [fishbone diagram](Ishikawa%20diagram.md)}@} is {@{a graphical means for finding possible problems in a chain of processes}@}. By collecting {@{the different data related to the problem}@}, and {@{inputting them into the [diagram](diagram.md)}@}, it becomes easier to {@{analyze the data in the order it is used}@}, and hence {@{determine the root of the problem}@}. This is commonly used to {@{find the bottleneck in a chain of processes}@} due to being able to {@{pinpoint the machine precisely responsible for the delay in production}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290-->

## consequences of bottlenecks in production

{@{The consequences of having bottlenecks in production}@} are {@{possible stalls in production, supply overstock, fall in employee morale, and loss of customers}@}. Bottlenecks can result in {@{the overloading of a machine}@}. Overloading a machine can lead to {@{the machinery getting damaged or worn out}@}, and the result of this would be {@{potential stretches of downtime in the long term}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-10,15,290-->

### stall in production

{@{A stall in production}@} would be the result of {@{one machine slowing down the entire chain of processes}@} and consistently {@{leaving the other machines unable to continue while it accumulates a large queue}@}. This inefficiency {@{significantly slows down production}@} as {@{many resources such as time, people, and machines are being paid to wait}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290-->

### supply overstock

In the event of {@{accumulation in the long-term}@}, {@{the capacity at which the bottlenecked machine is running could be so slow}@} that {@{the accumulated resources that are in the queue need to be stored}@}. {@{The cost of storing resources is significant}@} as it {@{takes resources to transport the materials back and forth as well as requiring space, another potential cost}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290-->

### fall in employee morale

The result of bottlenecks could {@{require more work from employees as well as longer hours}@}. In addition, there's the factor of {@{stress and frustration with the bottlenecked machine and its operator}@}. This could result in {@{loss of efficiency}@} as {@{employees may not be very motivated to work}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290-->

## managing bottlenecks

Once {@{the bottleneck has been identified}@}, {@{assessing the degree of the bottleneck}@} is {@{crucial for determining how to manage the bottleneck}@}. The bottleneck could be {@{either minor or severe}@}. Minor bottlenecks {@{may not need to be immediately addressed}@}, whereas severe bottlenecks {@{should be dealt with immediately}@}. There are {@{several ways to eliminate bottlenecks}@}. Some means of doing so are: {@{Adding resources to the bottleneck operation \(more people\),<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> minimising downtime,<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> eliminating non-value activities}@}, {@{investing in more machinery which completes the same action, and optimising the bottlenecks operation}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup><sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> Other sources similarly suggest that once {@{the bottleneck has been identified}@} it is best to {@{ensure it is well maintained}@},<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> to {@{provide a constant buffer stock upstream of the bottleneck, to reduce time wasted in set ups and changeovers, and to train more operators for the bottlenecked machines}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup><sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> These are further explained below. Having {@{production scheduled to optimise efficiency}@}, is another means of effectively utilising the bottlenecked machine. This minimises the possibility that {@{the production quota will not be met}@}. Scheduling also reduces {@{the number of situations where production is halted}@} due to {@{a lack of personnel, due to increased organisation and greater planned out production}@}. It also allows for {@{the full advantage of the time available to be taken}@}, as {@{pockets of time can be found to keep the machine running for as many hours as possible in a week}@}.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-26,23,250!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290-->

### increasing number of operators or employees

{@{Increasing the number of operators or increasing the number of staff}@} can be {@{beneficial for multiple reasons}@}. Increasing the number of operators can {@{increase efficiency}@}, as they can all work {@{different timed shifts and hence the bottlenecked machine can run for longer hours}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> In addition, if {@{one worker is sick, unable to work, or quits}@}, there will {@{always be someone available to replace him}@}. Increasing the number of employees can be beneficial to increasing efficiency.<sup>[\[16\]](#^ref-16)</sup> This is because they can be {@{reassigned to work on parts of the bottlenecked machines' operations}@} which can be {@{broken down into smaller activities and reassigned to reduce the work load of the machine}@}, hence {@{reducing the accumulation}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup><sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup><sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> {@{Reassigning other work to different machines}@}, allows {@{less accumulation or delay for the bottlenecked machine}@}. This significantly speeds up production, as it reduces {@{the wait time of the machines farther along the chain of processes, increasing productivity}@}.<sup>[\[17\]](#^ref-17)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-20,19,250-->

### minimizing downtime, setup and changeover time

To compensate for {@{being the weakest link in the chain of processes}@}, the bottleneck machine will {@{have to run for longer periods of time}@}. {@{Changeover and setup time}@} should be {@{minimised to allow the machines to run for slightly longer}@}, reducing {@{the impact of the bottleneck}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> Minimizing downtime by {@{having the bottlenecked machines run from earlier until later}@} is {@{a common strategy for working around the problem}@}, however this does {@{increase the likelihood for the machine to be overloaded and need regular maintenance}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290-->

### eliminating non-value activities

In {@{removing all non-value activities}@}, you reduce {@{the amount of redundant tasks performed by the bottlenecked machine}@} and hence {@{maximize efficiency}@}. Removing the waste operations results in {@{a shorter cycle time hence allowing the machine to complete each process in less time}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290-->

### provide a constant buffer stock upstream

In order to {@{optimise the usage of the machine}@}, the machine should be {@{kept running for as long as possible and hence should never have to wait for materials or stock}@}, to increase productivity. This can be achieved by {@{putting a buffer stock in place}@}, so that {@{the machine always has some task it can be doing}@}. {@{The down side to this strategy}@} is that {@{inventory space will be needed to store the buffer stock}@}, for {@{when the machine before it in the chain of processes, is working}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290-->

## preventing bottlenecks

{@{Preventing bottlenecks}@} would be {@{ideal to avoid having to manage and resolve them in the future}@}. There are ways to {@{work around them when planning the [production environment](production%20environment.md#production)}@}. Giving {@{employees free rein over minor decision making}@}, will allow them to {@{make the decision they feel is most efficient}@}, and being {@{operators of the machine}@}, their experience will allow them to {@{become specialised in the use of the machine over time}@}.<sup>[\[18\]](#^ref-18)</sup> {@{Cross-training employees}@} will {@{increase adaptability in the production line and therefore reduce potential downtime in the future}@}. {@{Hiring high performance employees}@} will {@{reduce the possibility for bottlenecks to be formed by underperforming employees}@} who {@{are inefficient at using their assigned machinery}@}.<sup>[\[19\]](#^ref-19)</sup> {@{Planning for a higher potential output}@} when designing the production environment is {@{crucial in the long run}@}, for occurrences of {@{larger orders when there is need to run all the machinery}@}. {@{Having all the machinery running at full capacity}@} is {@{not always ideal}@}, due to situations where {@{malfunctions occur and production is halted}@}. Having {@{inspiring leaders who have a strong understanding of how to keep production running smoothly}@}, will allow {@{greater control of all the different processes in the chain of production}@}. Taking into account {@{the layout of the different processes}@}, can also {@{increase efficiency as it minimises delay caused in the transportation stage}@}. {@{The use of a proper layout}@} can {@{reduce the overhead of machines and can reduce material handling time}@}.<sup>[\[20\]](#^ref-20)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290-->

{@{Establishment of standardized exchanged protocols}@}, can {@{minimise the potential for future bottlenecks to occur through minimising down time}@}. This increases efficiency by {@{reducing any potential confusion between different sectors}@} and hence {@{reduces the possibility for delays of the arrival of raw materials}@}.<sup>[\[21\]](#^ref-21)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290-->

## static and dynamic systems and shifting bottlenecks

{@{A static bottleneck}@} is where {@{no random or unexpected fluctuations}@} \(such as those that would happen during {@{either a changeover or a breakdown of the system}@}\) occur. A static system {@{does not change in behavior and hence the system stays constant}@}. {@{Finding a bottleneck in a static system}@} is {@{very simple}@}, it is simply {@{the machine or process with the longest constant cycle time}@}. Static systems {@{do not exist in reality as no matter what}@}, there will {@{always be a slight fluctuation in cycle time}@}. This is because there is {@{no way to prevent all fluctuations from occurring to slow the system down}@}. An example of this could be {@{a power shortage or a natural disaster}@}.<sup>[\[22\]](#^ref-22)</sup> {@{The behavior of any system}@} is {@{vulnerable to any random event and hence all systems are dynamic}@}. {@{Dynamic systems}@} can be divided into {@{two main groups: Stable and unstable}@}. {@{The significant difference in the context of dynamic systems}@}, is that {@{the bottlenecks can shift}@}. {@{The speed of which a bottleneck shifts}@} depending on {@{the buffer between the processes}@}.<sup>[\[22\]](#^ref-22)</sup> {@{Bottlenecks shift}@} when {@{the location of the work center in the production area changes}@}, and this leads to {@{control problems due to the significant delay in output}@}. Shifting bottlenecks are a result of {@{inevitable, unexpected events, for which no planning is possible}@}.<sup>[\[23\]](#^ref-23)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-31,28,270!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-11,16,290-->

The steps suggested to {@{avoid or prevent shifting bottlenecks}@} are: <!--SR:!2025-03-10,15,290-->

- Step 1\) Re-evaluate ::@:: the maximum load of every machine, process or work center when accepting a new order. <!--SR:!2025-03-10,15,290!2025-03-09,14,290-->
