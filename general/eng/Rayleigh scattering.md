# Rayleigh scattering

{@{__Rayleigh scattering__}@} (/ˈreɪli/ RAY-lee), named after {@{the 19th-century British physicist [Lord Rayleigh](John%20William%20Strutt,%203rd%20Baron%20Rayleigh.md) (John William Strutt)}@}, is {@{the predominantly [elastic scattering](elastic%20scattering.md) of [light](light.md), or other [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md), by particles with a size much smaller than the [wavelength](wavelength.md) of the radiation}@}. For {@{light frequencies well below the [resonance](resonance.md) frequency of the scattering medium}@} \({@{normal [dispersion](dispersion%20relation.md)}@} regime\), {@{the amount of scattering}@} is {@{[inversely proportional](proportionality%20(mathematics)#inverse%20proportionality.md) to the [fourth power](fourth%20power.md) of the wavelength}@}, e.g., {@{a blue color is scattered much more than a red color as light propagates through air}@}. <!--SR:!2027-05-22,802,330!2026-03-06,451,310!2026-03-15,373,250!2026-02-17,109,270!2028-12-11,1103,270!2028-11-05,1176,310!2026-01-31,72,327!2026-02-01,73,327-->
