## line broadening and shift

### broadening due to local effects

#### pressure broadening

The presence of nearby particles will {@{affect the radiation emitted by an individual particle}@}. There are {@{two limiting cases by which this occurs}@}: {@{_impact pressure broadening_ or _collisional broadening_; _quasistatic pressure broadening_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-24,155,310!2025-03-14,171,310!2026-02-19,381,290-->

- _impact pressure broadening_ or _collisional broadening_ ::@:: The collision of other particles with the light emitting particle interrupts the emission process. When the duration of the collision is much shorter than the lifetime of the emission process, this interruption is likely to occur. This shortens the characteristic time for the process (by prematurely emitting photons), increasing the uncertainty in the [energy](energy.md) emitted by the uncertainty principle $\Delta E \Delta t \ge \hbar / 2$ (as occurs in natural broadening). This effect depends on both the [density](density.md) and the [temperature](temperature.md) of the gas. The broadening effect is described by a [Lorentzian](Cauchy%20distribution.md) profile and there may be an associated shift. <!--SR:!2025-08-04,255,290!2026-04-16,418,290-->
- _quasistatic pressure broadening_ ::@:: The presence of other particles shifts the energy levels in the emitting particle (see [spectral band](spectral%20band.md)), thereby altering the frequency of the emitted radiation. <!--SR:!2025-06-08,165,250!2025-04-26,193,310-->
