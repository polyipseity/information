## five forces that shape competition

The 5 forces are {@{threat of _new entrants_, bargaining power of _buyers_, threat of _substitutes_, bargaining power of _suppliers_, and _industry_ rivalry}@}. The first 4 forces {@{surrounds the last force in a loop}@}. <!--SR:!2029-07-17,1227,290!2028-02-04,1041,350-->

### threat of new entrants

{@{Barriers to entry}@} restrict the threat of new entrants. The barriers can be {@{business nature or government regulations}@}. <!--SR:!2028-02-16,1050,350!2028-12-21,1289,350-->

### threat of substitutes

A substitute product {@{uses a different technology to solve the same economic need}@}. <!--SR:!2027-10-18,924,330-->

### bargaining power of buyers

Buyers' power is high if {@{there are many alternatives, and low if there are few}@}. Unbranded or commoditized products or services have {@{no loyalty from buyers}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-19,1384,350!2027-09-18,902,330-->

### bargaining power of suppliers

Suppliers' power is high if {@{there are few suppliers, and low if there are many}@}. <!--SR:!2027-06-01,819,330-->

### industry rivalry

Industry rivalry is {@{the extent of competition among existing firms}@}. <!--SR:!2028-10-28,1247,350-->

## usage

Porter's five forces framework is great for {@{classical industries involving physical goods}@}, but not {@{globalized markets, industries not affected by all 5 forces, internet businesses, or new sectors spanning multiple industries}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-30,1201,350!2027-07-18,802,290-->
