# functor

- This article is about {@{the mathematical concept}@}. For other uses, see [Functor \(disambiguation\)](functor%20(disambiguation).md).
- {@{"Functoriality"}@} redirects here. For {@{the Langlands functoriality conjecture in number theory}@}, see {@{[Langlands program § Functoriality](Langlands%20program.md#functoriality)}@}.

In {@{[mathematics](mathematics.md), specifically [category theory](category%20theory.md)}@}, {@{a __functor__}@} is {@{a [mapping](map%20(mathematics).md) between [categories](category%20(mathematics).md)}@}. Functors were first {@{considered in [algebraic topology](algebraic%20topology.md)}@}, where {@{algebraic objects \(such as the [fundamental group](fundamental%20group.md)\) are associated to [topological spaces](topological%20space.md)}@}, and {@{maps between these algebraic objects are associated to [continuous](continuous%20function.md) maps between spaces}@}. Nowadays, functors are {@{used throughout modern mathematics to relate various categories}@}. Thus, functors are {@{important in all areas within mathematics to which [category theory](category%20theory.md) is applied}@}.

{@{The words _category_ and _functor_}@} were {@{borrowed by mathematicians from the philosophers [Aristotle](Aristotle.md) and [Rudolf Carnap](Rudolf%20Carnap.md), respectively}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> The latter used {@{_functor_ in a [linguistic](linguistics.md) context;<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> see [function word](function%20word.md)}@}.

Let {@{_C_ and _D_ be [categories](category%20(mathematics).md)}@}. {@{A __functor__ _F_ from _C_ to _D_}@} is a mapping that<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup>

- (annotation: object) ::@:: associates each [object](mathematical%20object.md) $X$ in _C_ to an object $F(X)$ in _D_,
- (annotation: morphism) ::@:: associates each [morphism](morphism.md) $f\colon X\to Y$ in _C_ to a morphism $F(f)\colon F(X)\to F(Y)$ in _D_ such that the following two conditions hold: (annotation: identity, composition)
  - (annotation: identity) ::@:: $F(\mathrm {id} _{X})=\mathrm {id} _{F(X)}\,\!$ for every object $X$ in _C_,
  - (annotation: composition) ::@:: $F(g\circ f)=F(g)\circ F(f)$ for all morphisms $f\colon X\to Y\,\!$ and $g\colon Y\to Z$ in _C_.
- (annotation: functor, notes) ::@:: (annotation: The object and morphism mappings are _not_ required to be injective or surjective. For example, see [constant functor](constant%20functor.md#examples), which maps every object to the same object and every morphism to the identity morphism of that object.)

That is, functors must {@{preserve [identity morphisms](morphism.md#definition) and [composition](function%20composition.md) of morphisms}@}.

### covariance and contravariance

- See also: [Covariance and contravariance \(computer science\)](covariance%20and%20contravariance%20(computer%20science).md)

There are {@{many constructions in mathematics that would be functors}@} but {@{for the fact that they "turn morphisms around" and "reverse composition"}@}. We then define {@{a __contravariant functor__ _F_ from _C_ to _D_}@} as a mapping that

- (annotation: contravariant, object) ::@:: associates each object $X$ in _C_ with an object $F(X)$ in _D_,
- (annotation: contravariant, morphism) ::@:: associates each morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ in _C_ with a morphism $F(f)\colon F(Y)\to F(X)$ in _D_ such that the following two conditions hold: (annotation: identity, composition)
  - (annotation: contravariant, identity) ::@:: $F(\mathrm {id} _{X})=\mathrm {id} _{F(X)}\,\!$ for every object $X$ in _C_,
  - (annotation: contravariant, morphism) ::@:: $F(g\circ f)=F(f)\circ F(g)$ for all morphisms $f\colon X\to Y$ and $g\colon Y\to Z$ in _C_.

Variance of functor ::@:: \(composite\)<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup>

- The composite of two functors of the same variance: ::@:: (annotation: composite is covariant)
  - $\mathrm {Covariant} \circ \mathrm {Covariant} \to \mathrm {Covariant}$
  - $\mathrm {Contravariant} \circ \mathrm {Contravariant} \to \mathrm {Covariant}$
- The composite of two functors of opposite variance: ::@:: (annotation: composite is contravariant)
  - $\mathrm {Covariant} \circ \mathrm {Contravariant} \to \mathrm {Contravariant}$
  - $\mathrm {Contravariant} \circ \mathrm {Covariant} \to \mathrm {Contravariant}$

Note that contravariant functors {@{reverse the direction of composition}@}.

Ordinary functors are also called {@{__covariant functors__ in order to distinguish them from contravariant ones}@}. Note that one can also define a contravariant functor as {@{a _covariant_ functor on the [opposite category](opposite%20category.md) $C^{\mathrm {op} }$}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> Some authors {@{prefer to write all expressions covariantly}@}. That is, instead of {@{saying $F\colon C\to D$ is a contravariant functor}@}, they {@{simply write $F\colon C^{\mathrm {op} }\to D$ \(or sometimes $F\colon C\to D^{\mathrm {op} }$\) and call it a functor}@}.

{@{Contravariant functors}@} are also occasionally called {@{_cofunctors_}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup>

There is a convention which refers to {@{"vectors"—i.e., [vector fields](vector%20field.md), elements of the space of sections $\Gamma (TM)$ of a [tangent bundle](tangent%20bundle.md) $TM$—as "contravariant"}@} and to {@{"covectors"—i.e., [1-forms](1-forms.md), elements of the space of sections $\Gamma {\mathord {\left(T^{*}M\right)} }$ of a [cotangent bundle](cotangent%20bundle.md) $T^{*}M$—as "covariant"}@}. This terminology {@{originates in physics}@}, and its rationale has to do with {@{the position of the indices \("upstairs" and "downstairs"\) in [expressions](Einstein%20summation.md)}@} such as {@{${x'}^{\,i}=\Lambda _{j}^{i}x^{j}$ for $\mathbf {x} '={\boldsymbol {\Lambda } }\mathbf {x}$ or $\omega '_{i}=\Lambda _{i}^{j}\omega _{j}$ for ${\boldsymbol {\omega } }'={\boldsymbol {\omega } }{\boldsymbol {\Lambda } }^{\textsf {T} }$}@}. (annotation: The top index {@{refers to the row index while the bottom index refers to the column index}@}. The notation omits {@{the summation sign over $j$ on the right hand side}@}.) In this formalism it is observed that {@{the coordinate transformation symbol $\Lambda _{i}^{j}$ \(representing the matrix ${\boldsymbol {\Lambda } }^{\textsf {T} }$\)}@} {@{acts on the "covector coordinates" "in the same way" as on the basis vectors: $\mathbf {e} _{i}=\Lambda _{i}^{j}\mathbf {e} _{j}$}@}—whereas it {@{acts "in the opposite way" on the "vector coordinates" \(but "in the same way" as on the basis covectors: $\mathbf {e} ^{i}=\Lambda _{j}^{i}\mathbf {e} ^{j}$\)}@}. This terminology is {@{contrary to the one used in category theory}@} because {@{it is the covectors that have _pullbacks_ in general and are thus _contravariant_}@}, whereas {@{vectors in general are _covariant_ since they can be _pushed forward_}@}. See also {@{[Covariance and contravariance of vectors](covariance%20and%20contravariance%20of%20vectors.md)}@}.

### opposite functor

{@{Every functor $F\colon C\to D$}@} induces {@{the __opposite functor__ $F^{\mathrm {op} }\colon C^{\mathrm {op} }\to D^{\mathrm {op} }$}@}, where {@{$C^{\mathrm {op} }$ and $D^{\mathrm {op} }$ are the [opposite categories](opposite%20category.md) to $C$ and $D$}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> By definition, {@{$F^{\mathrm {op} }$ maps objects and morphisms in the identical way as does $F$}@}. Since {@{$C^{\mathrm {op} }$ does not coincide with $C$ as a category, and similarly for $D$}@}, {@{$F^{\mathrm {op} }$ is distinguished from $F$}@}. For example, when {@{composing $F\colon C_{0}\to C_{1}$ with $G\colon C_{1}^{\mathrm {op} }\to C_{2}$}@}, one should {@{use either $G\circ F^{\mathrm {op} }$ or $G^{\mathrm {op} }\circ F$}@}. Note that, following {@{the property of [opposite category](opposite%20category.md), $\left(F^{\mathrm {op} }\right)^{\mathrm {op} }=F$}@}.

### bifunctors and multifunctors

{@{A __bifunctor__ \(also known as a __binary functor__\)}@} is {@{a functor whose domain is a [product category](product%20category.md)}@}. For example, {@{the [Hom functor](hom%20functor.md) is of the type _C<sup>op</sup>_ × _C_ → __Set__}@}. It can be seen as {@{a functor in _two_ arguments; it is contravariant in one argument, covariant in the other}@}.

{@{A __multifunctor__}@} is {@{a generalization of the functor concept to _n_ variables}@}. So, for example, {@{a bifunctor is a multifunctor with _n_ = 2}@}.

## properties

{@{Two important consequences}@} of the functor [axioms](axiom.md) are:

- (annotation: commutative diagram) ::@:: _F_ transforms each [commutative diagram](commutative%20diagram.md) in _C_ into a commutative diagram in _D_;
- (annotation: isomorphism) ::@:: if _f_ is an [isomorphism](isomorphism.md) in _C_, then _F_\(_f_\) is an isomorphism in _D_.

One can {@{compose functors}@}, i.e. if _F_ is a functor from _A_ to _B_ and {@{_G_ is a functor from _B_ to _C_ then one can form the composite functor _G_ ∘ _F_ from _A_ to _C_}@}. {@{Composition of functors}@} is {@{associative where defined}@}. {@{Identity of composition of functors}@} is {@{the identity functor}@}. This shows that {@{functors can be considered as morphisms in categories of categories}@}, for example in {@{the [category of small categories](category%20of%20small%20categories.md)}@}.

{@{A small category with a single object}@} is {@{the same thing as a [monoid](monoid.md)}@}: the morphisms of {@{a one-object category can be thought of as elements of the monoid}@}, and composition {@{in the category is thought of as the monoid operation}@}. {@{Functors between one-object categories}@} correspond to {@{monoid [homomorphisms](homomorphism.md)}@}. So in a sense, {@{functors between arbitrary categories}@} are {@{a kind of generalization of monoid homomorphisms to categories with more than one object}@}.

## examples

__[Diagram](diagram%20(category%20theory).md)__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; For categories _C_ and _J_, a diagram of type _J_ (annotation: the categorical analogue of an indexed family in set theory) in _C_ is a covariant functor $D\colon J\to C$.

__[\(Category theoretical\) presheaf](presheaf%20(category%20theory).md)__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; For categories _C_ and _J_, a _J_-presheaf on _C_ is a contravariant (annotation: _not_ covariant) functor $D\colon C\to J$. <p> In the special case when J is __Set__, the category of sets and functions, _D_ is called a [presheaf](presheaf%20(category%20theory).md) on _C_.

__Presheaves \(over a topological space\)__

&emsp; If {@{_X_ is a [topological space](topological%20space.md)}@}, then {@{the [open sets](open%20set.md) in _X_ form a [partially ordered set](partially%20ordered%20set.md) Open\(_X_\) under inclusion}@}. Like {@{every partially ordered set}@}, {@{Open\(_X_\) forms a small category}@} by {@{adding a single arrow _U_ → _V_ if and only if $U\subseteq V$}@}. {@{Contravariant functors on (annotation: i.e. from) Open\(_X_\)}@} are called {@{_[presheaves](presheaf.md#presheaves)_ on _X_}@}. For instance, by {@{assigning to every open set _U_ the [associative algebra](associative%20algebra.md) of real-valued continuous functions on _U_}@}, one obtains {@{a presheaf of algebras on _X_}@}.

__Constant functor__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; The functor _C_ → _D_ which maps every object of _C_ to a fixed object _X_ in _D_ and every morphism in _C_ to the identity morphism on _X_. Such a functor is called a _constant_ or _selection_ functor. (annotation: note that functors are not required to be injective or surjective)

__Endofunctor__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; A functor that maps a category to that same category; e.g., [polynomial functor](polynomial%20functor.md).

__Identity functor__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; In category _C_, written 1<sub>_C_</sub> or id<sub>_C_</sub>, maps an object to itself and a morphism to itself. The identity functor is an endofunctor.

__Diagonal functor__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; The [diagonal functor](diagonal%20functor.md) is defined as the functor from _D_ to the functor category _D_<sup>_C_</sup> which sends each object in _D_ to the constant functor at that object.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Limit functor__

&emsp; For {@{a fixed [index category](index%20category.md) _J_}@}, if {@{every functor _J_ → _C_ has a [limit](limit%20(category%20theory).md) \(for instance if _C_ is complete\)}@}, then {@{the limit functor _C_<sup>_J_</sup> → _C_ assigns to each functor its limit}@}. {@{The existence of this functor}@} can be {@{proved by realizing that it is the [right-adjoint](adjoint%20functors.md) to the [diagonal functor](diagonal%20functor.md)}@} and invoking {@{the [Freyd adjoint functor theorem](Freyd%20adjoint%20functor%20theorem.md)}@}. This requires {@{a suitable version of the [axiom of choice](axiom%20of%20choice.md)}@}. Similar remarks apply to {@{the colimit functor \(which assigns to every functor its colimit, and is covariant\)}@}.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Power sets functor__

&emsp; {@{The power set functor _P_ : __Set__ → __Set__}@} maps {@{each set to its [power set](power%20set.md)}@} and {@{each function $f\colon X\to Y$ to the map which sends $U\in {\mathcal {P} }(X)$ to its image $f(U)\in {\mathcal {P} }(Y)$}@}. One can also consider {@{the __contravariant power set functor__}@} which {@{sends $f\colon X\to Y$ to the map which sends $V\subseteq Y$ to its [inverse image](inverse%20image.md#inverse%20image) $f^{-1}(V)\subseteq X$}@}.

&emsp; For example, if {@{$X=\{0,1\}$ then $F(X)={\mathcal {P} }(X)=\{\{\},\{0\},\{1\},X\}$}@}. Suppose {@{$f(0)=\{\}$ and $f(1)=X$}@}. Then $F(f)$ is {@{the function which sends any subset $U$ of $X$ to its image $f(U)$}@}, which in this case means {@{$\{\}\mapsto f(\{\})=\{\}$, where $\mapsto$ denotes the mapping under $F(f)$}@}, so this could also be {@{written as $(F(f))(\{\})=\{\}$}@}. For the other values, {@{$\{0\}\mapsto f(\{0\})=\{f(0)\}=\{\{\}\},\ {}$ $\{1\}\mapsto f(\{1\})=\{f(1)\}=\{X\},\ {}$ $\{0,1\}\mapsto f(\{0,1\})=\{f(0),f(1)\}=\{\{\},X\}$}@}. Note that $f(\{0,1\})$ consequently {@{generates the [trivial topology](trivial%20topology.md) on $X$}@}. Also note that {@{although the function $f$ in this example mapped to the power set of $X$}@}, that {@{need not be the case in general}@}.

__Dual vector space__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; The map which assigns to every [vector space](vector%20space.md) its [dual space](dual%20space.md) and to every [linear map](linear%20operator.md) its dual or transpose is a contravariant (annotation: _not_ covariant) functor from the category of all vector spaces over a fixed [field](field%20(mathematics).md) to itself.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Fundamental group__

&emsp; Consider {@{the category of [pointed topological spaces](pointed%20topological%20space.md), i.e. topological spaces with distinguished points}@}. The objects are {@{pairs \(_X_, _x_<sub>0</sub>\), where _X_ is a topological space and _x_<sub>0</sub> is a point in _X_}@}. {@{A morphism from \(_X_, _x_<sub>0</sub>\) to \(_Y_, _y_<sub>0</sub>\)}@} is given by {@{a [continuous](continuous%20function%20(topology).md#continuous%20functions%20between%20topological%20spaces) map _f_ : _X_ → _Y_ with _f_\(_x_<sub>0</sub>\) = _y_<sub>0</sub>}@}.

&emsp; To {@{every topological space _X_ with distinguished point _x_<sub>0</sub>}@}, one can define {@{the [fundamental group](fundamental%20group.md) based at _x_<sub>0</sub>, denoted π<sub>1</sub>\(_X_, _x_<sub>0</sub>\)}@}. This is {@{the [group](group%20(mathematics).md) of [homotopy](homotopy.md) classes of loops based at _x_<sub>0</sub>}@}, with {@{the group operation of concatenation}@}. If {@{_f_ : _X_ → _Y_ is a morphism of [pointed spaces](pointed%20space.md)}@}, then {@{every loop in _X_ with base point _x_<sub>0</sub> can be composed with _f_ to yield a loop in _Y_ with base point _y_<sub>0</sub>}@}. This operation is {@{compatible with the homotopy [equivalence relation](equivalence%20relation.md) and the composition of loops}@}, and we get {@{a [group homomorphism](group%20homomorphism.md) from π\(_X_, _x_<sub>0</sub>\) to π\(_Y_, _y_<sub>0</sub>\)}@}. We thus obtain {@{a functor from the category of pointed topological spaces to the [category of groups](category%20of%20groups.md)}@}.

&emsp; In {@{the category of topological spaces \(without distinguished point\)}@}, one considers {@{homotopy classes of generic curves}@}, but {@{they cannot be composed unless they share an endpoint}@}. Thus one has {@{the __fundamental [groupoid](groupoid.md)__ instead of the fundamental group}@}, and {@{this construction is functorial}@}.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Algebra of continuous functions__

&emsp; {@{A contravariant (annotation: _not_ covariant) functor}@} from {@{the category of [topological spaces](topology.md) \(with continuous maps as morphisms\) to the category of real [associative algebras](associative%20algebra.md)}@} is given by {@{assigning to every topological space _X_ the algebra C\(_X_\) of all real-valued continuous functions on that space}@}. {@{Every continuous map _f_ : _X_ → _Y_}@} induces {@{an [algebra homomorphism](algebra%20homomorphism.md#algebra%20homomorphisms) C\(_f_\) : C\(_Y_\) → C\(_X_\)}@} by {@{the rule C\(_f_\)\(_φ_\) = _φ_ ∘ _f_ for every _φ_ in C\(_Y_\)}@}.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Tangent and cotangent bundles__

&emsp; The map which {@{sends every [differentiable manifold](differentiable%20manifold.md) to its [tangent bundle](tangent%20bundle.md) and every [smooth map](smooth%20map.md) to its [derivative](derivative.md)}@} is {@{a covariant functor from the category of differentiable manifolds to the category of [vector bundles](vector%20bundle.md)}@}.

&emsp; {@{Doing this constructions pointwise}@} gives {@{the [tangent space](tangent%20space.md)}@}, {@{a covariant functor from the category of pointed differentiable manifolds to the category of real vector spaces}@}. Likewise, {@{[cotangent space](cotangent%20space.md)}@} is {@{a contravariant functor, essentially the composition of the tangent space with the [dual space](#dual%20vector%20space) above}@}.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Group actions/representations__

&emsp; {@{Every [group](group%20(mathematics).md) _G_}@} can be {@{considered as a category with a single object whose morphisms are the elements of _G_}@}. {@{A functor from _G_ to __Set__}@} is then {@{nothing but a [group action](group%20action%20(mathematics).md) of _G_ on a particular set, i.e. a _G_-set}@}. Likewise, {@{a functor from _G_ to the [category of vector spaces](category%20of%20vector%20spaces.md), __Vect__<sub>_K_</sub>}@}, is {@{a [linear representation](linear%20representation.md) of _G_}@}. In general, {@{a functor _G_ → _C_}@} can be considered as {@{an "action" of _G_ on an object in the category _C_}@}. If {@{_C_ is a group}@}, then {@{this action is a group homomorphism}@}.

__Lie algebras__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; Assigning to every real \(complex\) [Lie group](Lie%20group.md) its real \(complex\) [Lie algebra](Lie%20algebra.md) defines a functor.

__Tensor products__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; If _C_ denotes the category of vector spaces over a fixed field, with [linear maps](linear%20operator.md) as morphisms, then the [tensor product](tensor%20product.md) $V\otimes W$ defines a functor _C_ × _C_ → _C_ which is covariant in both arguments.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup>

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Forgetful functors__

&emsp; {@{The functor _U_ : __Grp__ → __Set__}@} which {@{maps a [group](group%20(mathematics).md) to its underlying set and a [group homomorphism](group%20homomorphism.md) to its underlying function of sets is a functor}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> {@{Functors like these, which "forget" some structure}@}, are termed {@{_[forgetful functors](forgetful%20functor.md)_}@}. Another example is {@{the functor __Rng__ → __Ab__ which maps a [ring](ring%20(algebra).md) to its underlying additive [abelian group](abelian%20group.md)}@}. {@{Morphisms in __Rng__ \([ring homomorphisms](ring%20homomorphism.md)\)}@} become {@{morphisms in __Ab__ \(abelian group homomorphisms\)}@}.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Free functors__

&emsp; {@{Going in the opposite direction of forgetful functors}@} are {@{free functors}@}. {@{The free functor _F_ : __Set__ → __Grp__}@} {@{sends every set _X_ to the [free group](free%20group.md) generated by _X_}@}. Functions get {@{mapped to group homomorphisms between free groups}@}. Free constructions {@{exist for many categories based on structured sets. See [free object](free%20object.md)}@}.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Homomorphism groups__

&emsp; {@{To every pair _A_, _B_ of [abelian groups](group%20(mathematics).md)}@} one can {@{assign the abelian group Hom\(_A_, _B_\) consisting of all [group homomorphisms](group%20homomorphism.md) from _A_ to _B_}@}. This is {@{a functor which is contravariant in the first and covariant in the second argument, i.e. it is a functor __Ab__<sup>op</sup> × __Ab__ → __Ab__ \(where __Ab__ denotes the [category of abelian groups](category%20of%20abelian%20groups.md) with group homomorphisms\)}@}. If {@{_f_ : _A_<sub>1</sub> → _A_<sub>2</sub> and _g_ : _B_<sub>1</sub> → _B_<sub>2</sub> are morphisms in __Ab__}@}, then {@{the group homomorphism Hom\(_f_, _g_\): Hom\(_A_<sub>2</sub>, _B_<sub>1</sub>\) → Hom\(_A_<sub>1</sub>, _B_<sub>2</sub>\)}@} is given by {@{_φ_ ↦ _g_ ∘ _φ_ ∘ _f_. See [Hom functor](hom%20functor.md)}@}.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Representable functors__

&emsp; We can {@{generalize the previous example to any category _C_}@}. To {@{every pair _X_, _Y_ of objects in _C_}@} one can {@{assign the set Hom\(_X_, _Y_\) of morphisms from _X_ to _Y_}@}. This defines {@{a functor to __Set__ which is contravariant in the first argument and covariant in the second, i.e. it is a functor _C_<sup>op</sup> × _C_ → __Set__}@}. If {@{_f_ : _X_<sub>1</sub> → _X_<sub>2</sub> and _g_ : _Y_<sub>1</sub> → _Y_<sub>2</sub> are morphisms in _C_}@}, then {@{the map Hom\(_f_, _g_\) : Hom\(_X_<sub>2</sub>, _Y_<sub>1</sub>\) → Hom\(_X_<sub>1</sub>, _Y_<sub>2</sub>\)}@} is given by {@{_φ_ ↦ _g_ ∘ _φ_ ∘ _f_}@}.

&emsp; Functors like these are called {@{[representable functors](representable%20functor.md)}@}. {@{An important goal in many settings}@} is to {@{determine whether a given functor is representable}@}.

## relation to other categorical concepts

Let {@{_C_ and _D_ be categories}@}. {@{The collection of all functors from _C_ to _D_}@} forms {@{the objects of a category: the [functor category](functor%20category.md)}@}. {@{Morphisms in this category}@} are {@{[natural transformations](natural%20transformation.md) between functors}@}.

Functors are often {@{defined by [universal properties](universal%20property.md)}@}; examples are {@{the [tensor product](tensor%20product.md), the [direct sum](direct%20sum%20of%20modules.md) and [direct product](direct%20product.md) of groups or vector spaces}@}, {@{construction of free groups and modules, [direct](direct%20limit.md) and [inverse](inverse%20limit.md) limits}@}. {@{The concepts of [limit and colimit](limit%20(category%20theory).md)}@} {@{generalize several of the above}@}.

{@{Universal constructions}@} often {@{give rise to pairs of [adjoint functors](adjoint%20functors.md)}@}.

## computer implementations

- Main article: [Functor \(functional programming\)](functor%20(functional%20programming).md)

Functors sometimes {@{appear in [functional programming](functional%20programming.md)}@}. For instance, {@{the programming language [Haskell](Haskell%20(programming%20language).md)}@} has {@{a [class](type%20class.md) `Functor`}@} where {@{[`fmap`](map%20(higher-order%20function).md#generalization) is a [polytypic function](polytypic%20function.md#polytypism)}@} used to {@{map [functions](function%20(computer%20programming).md) \(_morphisms_ on _Hask_, the category of Haskell types\)<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> between existing types to functions between some new types}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup>
