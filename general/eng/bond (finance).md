In {@{[finance](finance.md)}@}, {@{a __bond__}@} is {@{a type of [security](security%20(finance).md) under which the issuer \([debtor](debtor.md)\) owes the holder \([creditor](creditor.md)\) a [debt](debt.md)}@}, and is {@{obliged â depending on the terms â to provide [cash flow](cash%20flow.md) to the creditor}@}; which usually {@{consists of repaying the principal \(the amount borrowed\) of the bond at the [maturity date](maturity%20(finance).md)}@}, as well as {@{[interest](interest.md) \(called the [coupon](coupon%20(bond).md)\) over a specified amount of time}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {@{The timing and the amount of cash flow provided}@} {@{varies, depending on the economic value that is emphasized upon}@}, thus giving {@{rise to different types of bonds}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {@{The interest}@} is usually {@{payable at fixed intervals}@}: {@{semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods}@}. Thus, {@{a bond}@} is {@{a form of [loan](loan.md) or [IOU](IOU.md)}@}. Bonds provide {@{the borrower with external funds}@} to {@{finance long-term investments}@} or, in the case of {@{[government bonds](government%20bond.md)}@}, to {@{finance current expenditure}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306-->

{@{Bonds and [stocks](share%20capital.md)}@} are {@{both [securities](security%20(finance).md)}@}, but {@{the major difference between the two}@} is that {@{\(capital\) [stockholders](stockholder.md) have an [equity](equity%20(finance).md) stake in a company \(i.e. they are owners\)}@}, whereas {@{bondholders have a creditor stake in a company \(i.e. they are lenders\)}@}. As {@{creditors}@}, bondholders have {@{priority over stockholders}@}. This means they will be {@{repaid in advance of stockholders}@}, but will {@{rank behind [secured creditors](secured%20creditor.md)}@}, in {@{the event of bankruptcy}@}. {@{Another difference}@} is that bonds usually {@{have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed}@}, whereas stocks typically {@{remain outstanding indefinitely}@}. {@{An exception}@} is {@{an irredeemable bond, which is a [perpetuity](perpetuity.md)}@}, that is, {@{a bond with no maturity}@}. {@{[Certificates of deposit](certificate%20of%20deposit.md) \(CDs\) or short-term [commercial paper](commercial%20paper.md)}@} are classified as {@{[money market](money%20market.md) instruments and not bonds}@}: the main difference is {@{the length of the term of the instrument}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306-->

{@{The most common forms}@} include {@{[municipal](municipal%20bond.md), [corporate](corporate%20bond.md), and [government bonds](government%20bond.md)}@}. Very often {@{the bond is negotiable}@}, that is, {@{the ownership of the instrument}@} can be {@{transferred in the [secondary market](secondary%20market.md)}@}. This means that once {@{the transfer agents at the bank [medallion-stamp](medallion%20stamp.md) the bond}@}, it is {@{highly [liquid](market%20liquidity.md) on the secondary market}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> {@{The price of a bond in the secondary market}@} may {@{differ substantially from the principal}@} due to {@{various factors in [bond valuation](bond%20valuation.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325-->

Bonds are often identified by {@{their international securities identification number, or [ISIN](International%20Securities%20Identification%20Number.md)}@}, which is {@{a 12-digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies debt securities}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325-->

## etymology

In {@{[English](English%20language.md)}@}, {@{the word "[bond](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bond)"}@} relates to {@{the etymology of "bind"}@}. {@{The use of the word "bond"}@} in {@{this sense of an "instrument binding one to pay a sum to another"}@} dates {@{from at least the 1590s}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup><sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,323-->

## issuance

Bonds are issued by {@{public authorities, credit institutions, companies and [supranational](supranational%20union.md) institutions}@} in {@{the [primary markets](primary%20market.md)}@}. {@{The most common process for issuing bonds}@} is {@{through [underwriting](underwriting.md)}@}. When {@{a bond issue is underwritten}@}, {@{one or more securities firms or banks, forming a [syndicate](syndicate.md)}@}, buy {@{the entire issue of bonds from the issuer and resell them to investors}@}. {@{The security firm}@} takes {@{the risk of being unable to sell on the issue to end investors}@}. {@{Primary issuance}@} is {@{arranged by _[bookrunners](bookrunner.md)_}@} who {@{arrange the bond issue, have direct contact with investors and act as advisers to the bond issuer}@} in terms of {@{timing and price of the bond issue}@}. {@{The bookrunner}@} is {@{listed first among all underwriters participating in the issuance}@} in {@{the [tombstone ads](tombstone%20(advertising).md) commonly used to announce bonds to the public}@}. {@{The bookrunners' willingness to underwrite}@} must be {@{discussed prior to any decision on the terms of the bond issue}@} as {@{there may be limited demand for the bonds}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320-->

In contrast, {@{government bonds}@} are {@{usually issued in an auction}@}. In some cases, {@{both members of the public and banks}@} may {@{bid for bonds}@}. In other cases, {@{only market makers may bid for bonds}@}. {@{The [overall rate of return](yield%20to%20maturity.md) on the bond}@} depends on {@{both the terms of the bond and the price paid}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> {@{The terms of the bond, such as the coupon}@}, are {@{fixed in advance}@} and the price is {@{determined by the market}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306-->

In the case of {@{an underwritten bond}@}, {@{the underwriters}@} will {@{charge a fee for underwriting}@}. {@{An alternative process for bond issuance}@}, which is {@{commonly used for smaller issues and avoids this cost}@}, is {@{the private placement bond}@}. {@{Bonds sold directly to buyers}@} may {@{not be tradeable in the [bond market](bond%20market.md)}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,274-->

{@{Historically}@}, {@{an alternative practice of issuance}@} was for {@{the borrowing government authority}@} to {@{issue bonds over a period of time, usually at a fixed price}@}, with {@{volumes sold on a particular day dependent on market conditions}@}. This was called {@{a _tap issue_ or _bond tap_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,325-->

{@{Nominal, principal, par, or face amount}@} is {@{the amount on which the issuer pays interest}@}, and which, {@{most commonly, has to be repaid at the end of the term}@}. {@{Some structured bonds}@} can have {@{a redemption amount which is different from the face amount}@} and can be {@{linked to the performance of particular assets}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306-->

### maturity

The issuer is {@{obligated to repay the nominal amount}@} on {@{the [maturity](maturity%20(finance).md) date}@}. As long as {@{all due payments have been made}@}, the issuer has {@{no further obligations to the bond holders after the maturity date}@}. {@{The length of time until the maturity date}@} is often referred to as {@{the term or tenor or maturity of a bond}@}. {@{The maturity}@} can be {@{any length of time}@}, although {@{debt securities with a term of less than one year}@} are {@{generally designated money market instruments rather than bonds}@}. {@{Most bonds}@} have {@{a term shorter than 30 years}@}. Some bonds have been issued with {@{terms of 50 years or more}@}, and historically there have been {@{some issues with no maturity date \(irredeemable\)}@}. In {@{the market for United States Treasury securities}@}, there are {@{four categories of bond maturities}@}: <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,270!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,323-->

### coupon

> {@{![Bond issued by the [Dutch East India Company](Dutch%20East%20India%20Company.md) in 1623](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Vereinigte%20Ostindische%20Compagnie%20bond%20-%20Middelburg%20-%20Amsterdam%20-%201622.jpg)}@}

{@{The [coupon](coupon%20(bond).md)}@} is {@{the interest rate that the issuer pays to the holder}@}. For {@{[fixed rate bonds](fixed%20rate%20bond.md#coupon)}@}, the coupon is {@{fixed throughout the life of the bond}@}. For {@{[floating rate notes](floating%20rate%20note.md)}@}, the coupon {@{varies throughout the life of the bond}@} and is based on {@{the movement of a [money market](money%20market.md) [reference rate](reference%20rate.md)}@} \(historically this was {@{generally [LIBOR](Libor.md)}@}, but with {@{its discontinuation}@} the market reference rate has {@{transitioned to [SOFR](SOFR.md)}@}\). <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306-->

Historically, {@{coupons}@} were {@{physical attachments to the paper bond certificates}@}, with {@{each coupon representing an interest payment}@}. On {@{the interest due date}@}, the bondholder would {@{hand in the coupon to a bank in exchange for the interest payment}@}. Today, interest payments are {@{almost always paid electronically}@}. Interest can be paid at {@{different frequencies}@}: generally {@{semi-annual \(every six months\) or annual}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,320-->

### yield

{@{The yield}@} is {@{the rate of return received from investing in the bond}@}. It usually refers to one of the following: <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306-->

- {@{The [current yield](current%20yield.md), or running yield}@}: {@{the annual interest payment}@} divided by {@{the current market price of the bond \(often the [clean price](clean%20price.md)\)}@}.
- {@{The [yield to maturity](yield%20to%20maturity.md) \(or [redemption yield](redemption%20yield.md), as it is termed in the United Kingdom\)}@} is {@{an estimate of the total rate of return anticipated to be earned by an investor}@} who {@{buys a bond at a given market price, holds it to maturity, and receives all interest payments and the capital redemption on schedule}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> It is {@{a more useful measure of the return on a bond than current yield}@} because it {@{takes into account the [present value](present%20value.md) of future interest payments and principal repaid at maturity}@}. {@{The yield to maturity or redemption yield calculated at the time of purchase}@} is {@{not necessarily the return the investor will actually earn}@}, as finance scholars Dr. Annette Thau and Dr. [Frank Fabozzi](Frank%20Fabozzi.md) have noted. {@{The yield to maturity will be realized}@} only under {@{certain conditions}@}, including 1\) {@{all interest payments}@} are {@{reinvested rather than spent}@}, and 2\) {@{all interest payments}@} are {@{reinvested at the yield to maturity calculated at the time the bond is purchased}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup><sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> {@{This distinction}@} may {@{not be a concern to bond buyers who intend to spend rather than reinvest the coupon payments}@}, such as {@{those practicing asset/liability matching strategies}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,306-->

### credit quality

{@{The quality of the issue}@} refers to {@{the probability that the bondholders will receive the amounts promised at the due dates}@}. In other words, {@{credit quality}@} tells investors {@{how likely the borrower is going to default}@}. This will depend on {@{a wide range of factors}@}. {@{[High-yield bonds](high-yield%20bond.md)}@} are {@{bonds that are rated below investment grade by the [credit rating agencies](credit%20rating%20agency.md)}@}. As {@{these bonds are riskier than investment grade bonds}@}, investors {@{expect to earn a higher yield}@}. These bonds are also called {@{[_junk bonds_.](high-yield%20debt.md)}@} <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,270!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306-->

### market price

{@{The market price of a tradable bond}@} will be {@{influenced, among other factors}@}, by {@{the amounts, currency}@} and timing of {@{the interest payments and capital repayment due}@}, {@{the quality}@} of the bond, and {@{the available redemption yield of other comparable bonds}@} which can be {@{traded in the markets}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,274-->

{@{The price}@} can be quoted as {@{[clean](clean%20price.md) or [dirty](dirty%20price.md)}@}. {@{"Dirty"}@} includes {@{the present value of all future cash flows}@}, including {@{accrued interest}@}, and is most often {@{used in Europe}@}. {@{"Clean"}@} {@{does not include accrued interest}@}, and is {@{most often used in the U.S.}@} <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306-->

{@{The issue price}@} at which investors {@{buy the bonds when they are first issued}@} will {@{typically be approximately equal to the nominal amount}@}. {@{The net proceeds that the issuer receives}@} are thus {@{the issue price, less issuance fees}@}. {@{The market price of the bond}@} will {@{vary over its life}@}: it may {@{trade at a premium \(above par}@}, usually because {@{market interest rates have fallen since issue}@}\), or at {@{a discount \(price below par}@}, if {@{market rates have risen or there is a high [probability of default](probability%20of%20default.md) on the bond}@}\). <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306-->

### others

- {@{Indentures and Covenants}@}â{@{An [indenture](indenture.md)}@} is {@{a formal debt agreement that establishes the terms of a bond issue}@}, while {@{covenants}@} are {@{the clauses of such an agreement}@}. Covenants specify {@{the rights of bondholders and the duties of issuers}@}, such as {@{actions that the issuer is obligated to perform}@} or {@{is prohibited from performing}@}. In {@{the U.S.}@}, {@{federal and state securities and commercial laws}@} apply to {@{the enforcement of these agreements}@}, which are {@{construed by courts}@} as {@{contracts between issuers and bondholders{@{}@}. The terms may be changed}@} only with {@{great difficulty while the bonds are outstanding}@}, with {@{amendments to the governing document}@} generally {@{requiring approval by a [majority](majority.md) \(or [super-majority](supermajority.md)\) vote of the bondholders}@}.
- {@{Optionality}@}: Occasionally a bond may {@{contain an [embedded option](embedded%20option.md)}@}; that is, it {@{grants [option-like](option%20(finance).md) features to the holder or the issuer}@}:
  - {@{Callability}@}âSome bonds give {@{the issuer the right to repay the bond before the maturity date on the call dates}@}; see {@{[call option](call%20option.md)}@}. These bonds are referred to as {@{[callable bonds](callable%20bond.md)}@}. Most callable bonds allow {@{the issuer to repay the bond at [par](par%20value.md)}@}. With {@{some bonds}@}, the issuer has to {@{pay a premium, the so-called call premium}@}. This is {@{mainly the case for high-yield bonds}@}. These have {@{very strict covenants}@}, restricting {@{the issuer in its operations}@}. To be {@{free from these covenants}@}, the issuer can {@{repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost}@}.
  - {@{Puttability}@}âSome bonds give {@{the holder the right to force the issuer to repay the bond before the maturity date on the put dates}@}; see {@{[put option](put%20option.md)}@}. These are referred to as {@{retractable or [putable bonds](putable%20bond.md)}@}.
  - {@{Call dates and put dates}@}â{@{the [dates](option%20style.md) on which}@} callable and putable bonds can be {@{redeemed early}@}. There are four main categories:
    - {@{A Bermudan callable}@} has {@{several call dates, usually coinciding with coupon dates}@}.
    - {@{A European callable}@} has {@{only one call date}@}. This is {@{a special case of a Bermudan callable}@}.
    - {@{An American callable}@} can be {@{called at any time until the maturity date}@}.
    - {@{A death put}@} is {@{an optional redemption feature on a debt instrument}@} allowing {@{the beneficiary of the estate of a deceased bondholder}@} to {@{put \(sell\) the bond back to the issuer at face value}@} in the event of {@{the bondholder's death or legal incapacitation}@}. This is also known as {@{a "survivor's option"}@}.
  - {@{[Sinking fund](sinking%20fund.md) provision}@} of {@{the corporate bond indenture}@} requires {@{a certain portion of the issue to be retired periodically}@}. {@{The entire bond issue}@} can be {@{liquidated by the maturity date}@}; if {@{not}@}, the remainder is called {@{balloon maturity}@}. {@{Issuers}@} may either {@{pay to trustees, which in turn call randomly selected bonds in the issue}@}, or, alternatively, {@{purchase bonds in the open market, then return them to trustees}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-09,3,281!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,325-->

Bonds can be {@{categorised in several ways}@}, such as {@{the type of issuer, the currency}@}, {@{the term of the bond \(length of time to maturity\) and the conditions applying to the bond}@}. The following descriptions are {@{not mutually exclusive}@}, and {@{more than one of them may apply to a particular bond}@}: <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,306-->

### the nature of the issuer and the security offered

{@{The nature of the issuer}@} will {@{affect the security \(certainty of receiving the contracted payments\) offered by the bond}@}, and sometimes {@{the tax treatment}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306-->

- {@{[Government bonds](government%20bond.md), often also called treasury bonds}@}, are {@{issued by a [sovereign](sovereignty.md) national government}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> Some countries have {@{repeatedly defaulted on their government bonds}@}, while some other treasury bonds have been {@{treated as risk-free and not exposed to default risk}@}. {@{[Risk-free bonds](risk-free%20bond.md)}@} are {@{the safest bonds}@}, with {@{the lowest interest rate}@}. A Treasury bond is backed by {@{the "full faith and credit" of the relevant government}@}. However, in {@{reality most or all government bonds}@} {@{do carry some residual risk}@}. This is indicated by
  - {@{the award by [rating agencies](rating%20agencies.md)}@} of {@{a rating below the top rating}@},
  - bonds issued by {@{different national governments}@}, such as {@{various member states of the European Union}@}, all {@{denominated in Euros}@}, offering {@{different market yields reflecting their different risks}@}.
- {@{A [supranational bond](supranational%20bond.md#debt), also known as a "supra"}@}, is issued by {@{a [supranational organisation](supranational%20union.md) like the [World Bank](World%20Bank.md)}@}. They have {@{a very good credit rating}@}, similar to {@{that on national government bonds}@}.
- {@{A [municipal bond](municipal%20bond.md)}@} issued by {@{a local authority or subdivision within a country}@},<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> for example {@{a city or a federal state}@}. These will {@{to varying degrees carry the backing of the national government}@}. In {@{the United States}@}, such bonds are {@{exempt from certain taxes}@}. For example, {@{Build America Bonds \(BABs\)}@} are {@{a form of municipal bond authorized by the [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009](American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009.md)}@}. Unlike {@{traditional US municipal bonds, which are usually tax exempt}@}, {@{interest received on BABs}@} is {@{subject to federal taxation}@}. However, as with {@{municipal bonds}@}, the bond is {@{tax-exempt within the US state where it is issued}@}. Generally, BABs offer {@{significantly higher yields than standard municipal bonds}@}.
  - {@{A [revenue bond](revenue%20bond.md)}@} is {@{a special type of municipal bond}@} distinguished by {@{its guarantee of repayment solely from revenues generated}@} by {@{a specified revenue-generating entity associated with the purpose of the bonds}@}. Revenue bonds are {@{typically "non-recourse"}@}, meaning that in {@{the event of default}@}, the bond holder has {@{no recourse to other governmental assets or revenues}@}.
- {@{A [War bond](war%20bond.md)}@} is {@{a bond issued by a government to fund military operations and other expenditure during wartime}@}. It will often {@{have a low return rate}@}, and so can be {@{bought due to a lack of opportunities}@} or {@{[patriotism](patriotism.md)}@}.
- {@{[Corporate bonds](corporate%20bond.md)}@} are {@{issued by corporations}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup>
- {@{[High-yield bonds](high-yield%20bond.md) \(junk bonds\)}@} are {@{bonds that are rated below investment grade by the [credit rating agencies](credit%20rating%20agency.md)}@}, because they are {@{uncertain that the issuer will be able or willing to pay the scheduled interest payments}@} and/or {@{redeem the bond at maturity}@}. As {@{these bonds are much riskier than investment grade bonds}@}, investors {@{expect to earn a much higher yield}@}.
- {@{A [climate bond](climate%20bond.md#green%20bonds%20for%20climate%20action)}@} is {@{a bond issued by a government or corporate entity}@} in order to {@{raise finance for [climate change](climate%20change.md) mitigation- or adaptation-related projects or programmes}@}. For example, in {@{2021 the UK government}@} started to {@{issue "green bonds"}@}.
- {@{[Asset-backed securities](asset-backed%20security.md)}@} are {@{bonds whose interest and principal payments are backed by underlying cash flows from other assets}@}. {@{Examples of asset-backed securities}@} are {@{[mortgage-backed securities](mortgage-backed%20security.md) \(MBSs\), [collateralized mortgage obligations](collateralized%20mortgage%20obligation.md) \(CMOs\), and [collateralized debt obligations](collateralized%20debt%20obligation.md) \(CDOs\)}@}.
- {@{[Covered bonds](covered%20bond.md)}@} are {@{backed by cash flows from mortgages or public sector assets}@}. Unlike {@{asset-backed securities}@}, {@{the assets for such bonds}@} {@{remain on the issuer's balance sheet}@}.
- {@{[Subordinated bonds](subordinated%20debt.md)}@} are {@{those that have a lower priority than other bonds of the issuer in case of [liquidation](liquidation.md)}@}. In {@{case of bankruptcy}@}, there is {@{a hierarchy of creditors}@}. First {@{the [liquidator](liquidator%20(law).md) is paid}@}, then {@{government taxes, etc.}@} {@{The first bond holders in line to be paid}@} are those {@{holding what are called senior bonds}@}. After they have been paid, {@{the subordinated bond holders are paid}@}. As a result, {@{the risk is higher}@}. Therefore, subordinated bonds {@{usually have a lower credit rating than senior bonds}@}. {@{The main examples of subordinated bonds}@} can be found in {@{bonds issued by banks and asset-backed securities}@}. The latter are {@{often issued in [tranches](tranche.md)}@}. {@{The senior tranches}@} get {@{paid back first}@}, {@{the subordinated tranches later}@}.
- {@{[Social impact bonds](social%20impact%20bond.md)}@} are {@{an agreement for public sector entities to pay back private investors}@} after {@{meeting verified improved social outcome goals}@} that {@{result in public sector savings from innovative social program pilot projects}@}. \(annotation: If {@{not met}@}, {@{the investors are not paid back}@}.\) <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-11,4,294-->

### the term of the bond

- Most bonds are {@{structured to mature on a stated date}@}, when {@{the principal is due to be repaid}@}, and {@{interest payments cease}@}. Typically, {@{a bond with term to maturity of under five years}@} would be {@{called a short bond}@}; {@{5 to 15 years}@} would be {@{"medium"}@}, and {@{over 15 years}@} would be {@{"long"}@}; but {@{the numbers may vary in different markets}@}.
- {@{[Perpetual bonds](perpetual%20bond.md)}@} are also often called {@{[perpetuities](perpetuity.md) or 'Perps'}@}. They have {@{no maturity date}@}. Historically {@{the most famous of these}@} were {@{the UK Consols}@} \(there were also {@{some other perpetual UK government bonds}@}, such as {@{War Loan, Treasury Annuities and undated Treasuries}@}\). Some of these were {@{issued back in 1888 or earlier}@}. There had been {@{insignificant quantities of these outstanding for decades}@}, and they have now {@{been fully repaid}@}. {@{Some ultra-long-term bonds}@} \(sometimes a bond can {@{last centuries}@}: {@{West Shore Railroad}@} issued {@{a bond which matures in 2361 \(i.e. 24th century\)}@}\) are {@{virtually perpetuities from a financial point of view}@}, with {@{the current value of principal near zero}@}.
- {@{The _Methuselah_}@} is {@{a type of bond with a maturity of 50 years or longer}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> The term is a reference to {@{[Methuselah](Methuselah.md), the oldest person whose age is mentioned in the [Hebrew Bible](Hebrew%20Bible.md)}@}. {@{The issuance of Methuselahs}@} has been {@{increasing in recent years}@} due to {@{demand for longer-dated assets from [pension](pension.md) plans}@}, particularly in {@{[France](France.md) and the [United Kingdom](United%20Kingdom.md)}@}. {@{Issuance of Methuselahs in the [United States](United%20States.md)}@} has been {@{limited}@}, however: {@{the [U.S. Treasury](U.S.%20Treasury.md)}@} {@{does not currently issue [Treasuries](Treasury%20security.md) with maturities beyond 30 years}@}, which would {@{serve as a reference level for any [corporate](corporate%20debt.md) issuance}@}.
- {@{A [Serial bond](serial%20bond.md)}@} is {@{a bond that matures in installments over a period of time}@}. For example, {@{a \$100,000, 5-year serial bond}@} might {@{pay \$20,000 per year}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,320-->

### the conditions applying to the bond

- {@{Fixed rate bonds}@} have {@{interest payments \("coupon"\)}@}, usually {@{semi-annual}@}, that {@{remains constant throughout the life of the bond}@}. Other variations include {@{stepped-coupon bonds}@}, whose {@{coupon increases during the life of the bond}@}.
- {@{[Floating rate notes](floating%20rate%20note.md) \(FRNs, floaters\)}@} have {@{a variable coupon}@} that is {@{linked to a [reference rate](reference%20rate.md) of interest}@}, such {@{as [Libor](Libor.md) or [Euribor](Euribor.md)}@}. For example, the coupon may be defined as {@{three-month USD LIBOR + 0.20%}@}. {@{The coupon rate}@} is {@{recalculated periodically}@}, typically {@{every one or three months}@}.
- {@{[Zero-coupon bonds](zero-coupon%20bond.md) \(zeros\)}@} pay {@{no regular interest}@}. They are {@{issued at a substantial discount to [par value](par%20value.md)}@}, so that {@{the interest is effectively rolled up to maturity}@} \(and usually {@{taxed as such}@}\). {@{The bondholder}@} {@{receives the full principal amount on the redemption date}@}. {@{An example of zero coupon bonds}@} is {@{Series E savings bonds issued by the U.S. government}@}. [Zero-coupon bonds](zero-coupon%20bond.md) may be {@{created from fixed rate bonds}@} by {@{a financial institution separating \("stripping off"\) the coupons from the principal}@}. This can create {@{a "Principal Only" zero-coupon bond}@} and {@{an "Interest Only" \(IO\) [strip bond](zero-coupon%20bond.md#strip%20bonds) from the original fixed income bond}@}.
- {@{[Inflation-indexed bonds](inflation-indexed%20bond.md) \(linkers\) \(US\) or index-linked bonds \(UK\)}@}, in which {@{the principal amount and the interest payments}@} are {@{indexed to [the level of consumer prices](consumer%20price%20index.md)}@}. {@{The interest rate}@} is normally {@{lower than for fixed rate bonds with a comparable maturity}@} \(this relationship {@{briefly reversed}@} for {@{short-term UK bonds in December 2008}@}\). {@{Higher inflation rates}@} {@{increase the [nominal](real%20versus%20nominal%20value%20(economics).md) principal and coupon amounts paid on these bonds}@}. {@{The [United Kingdom](United%20Kingdom.md)}@} was {@{the first sovereign issuer}@} to {@{issue inflation-linked [gilts](gilt-edged%20securities.md) in the 1980s}@}. {@{[Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities](Treasury%20Inflation-Protected%20Securities.md#TIPS) \(TIPS\) and [I-bonds](United%20States%20Treasury%20security.md#U.S.%20savings%20bonds)}@} are examples of {@{inflation-linked bonds issued by the U.S. government}@}.
- {@{Other indexed bonds}@}, for example {@{[equity-linked notes](equity-linked%20note.md)}@} and bonds {@{indexed on a business indicator \(income, added value\) or on a country's [GDP](GDP.md)}@}.
- {@{[Lottery bonds](lottery%20bond.md)}@} are {@{issued by European and other states}@}. {@{Interest}@} is {@{paid as on a traditional fixed rate bond}@}, but {@{the issuer}@} will {@{redeem randomly selected individual bonds}@} within {@{the issue according to a schedule}@}. {@{Some of these redemptions}@} will be {@{for a higher value than the face value of the bond}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274-->

### bonds with embedded options for the holder

- {@{A [bearer bond](bearer%20bond.md)}@} is {@{an official certificate issued without a named holder}@}. In other words, {@{the person who has the paper certificate}@} can {@{claim the value of the bond}@}. Often they are {@{registered by a number to prevent counterfeiting}@}, but may be {@{traded like cash}@}. Bearer bonds are {@{very risky}@} because {@{they can be lost or stolen}@}, due to the fact that {@{they can be claimed by whoever is in possession of them}@}<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup>. In some countries they were {@{historically popular}@} because {@{the owner could not be traced by the tax authorities}@}. For example, after {@{federal income tax began in the United States}@}, bearer bonds were {@{seen as an opportunity to conceal income or assets}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> {@{U.S. corporations}@} {@{stopped issuing bearer bonds in the 1960s}@}, {@{the U.S. Treasury stopped in 1982}@}, and {@{state and local tax-exempt bearer bonds}@} were {@{prohibited in 1983}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup>
- {@{A registered bond}@} is {@{a bond whose ownership \(and any subsequent purchaser\)}@} is {@{recorded by the issuer, or by a transfer agent}@}. {@{Interest payments and the principal upon maturity}@} are {@{sent to the registered owner}@}. The owner can {@{continue to receive interest with a duplicated bond}@} in {@{case of a loss}@}. However, the bond is {@{not easily transferable to other people}@}. Registered bonds {@{seldom appeared in the market for trading}@}. {@{The traceability of the bonds}@} means it has {@{a minor effect on bond prices}@}.

{@{The market price of a bond}@} is {@{the [present value](present%20value.md) of all expected [future interest](future%20interest.md) and principal payments of the bond}@}, here {@{discounted at the bond's [yield to maturity](yield%20to%20maturity.md) \(i.e. [rate of return](rate%20of%20return.md)\)}@}. {@{That relationship}@} is {@{the definition of the redemption yield on the bond}@}, which is {@{likely to be close to the current market interest rate}@} for {@{other bonds with similar characteristics}@}, as otherwise {@{there would be [arbitrage](arbitrage.md) opportunities}@}. {@{The yield and price of a bond}@} are {@{inversely related}@} so that when {@{market interest rates rise}@}, {@{bond prices fall and vice versa}@}.

Hence, {@{a deep discount \(annotation: i.e. zero-coupon\) US bond}@}, selling at {@{a price of 75.26}@}, indicates {@{a selling price of \$752.60 per bond sold}@}. \(Often, in {@{the US}@}, bond prices are quoted in {@{points and thirty-seconds of a point}@}, rather than {@{in decimal form}@}.\) {@{Some short-term bonds}@}, such as {@{the [U.S. Treasury bill](United%20States%20Treasury%20security.md#Treasury%20bill)}@}, are always {@{issued at a discount}@}, and pay {@{par amount at maturity rather than paying coupons}@}.

Although bonds are {@{not necessarily issued at par \(100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100\)}@}, their prices will {@{move towards par as they approach maturity}@} \(if {@{the market expects the maturity payment to be made in full and on time}@}\) as this is {@{the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond}@}. This is referred to as {@{"[pull to par](pull%20to%20par.md)"}@}. At {@{the time of issue of the bond}@}, {@{the coupon paid, and other conditions of the bond}@}, will have been {@{influenced by a variety of factors}@}, such as {@{current market interest rates, the length of the term and the creditworthiness of the issuer}@}. These factors are {@{likely to change over time}@}, so {@{the market price of a bond will vary after it is issued}@}. \(The position is {@{a bit more complicated for inflation-linked bonds}@}.\) <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,274-->

{@{The interest payment \("coupon payment"\)}@} divided by {@{the current price of the bond}@} is called {@{the [current yield](current%20yield.md)}@} \(this is {@{the [nominal yield](nominal%20yield.md)}@} {@{multiplied by the par value and divided by the price}@}\). There are {@{other yield measures that exist}@} such as {@{the yield to first call, yield to worst, yield to first par call}@}, {@{yield to put, cash flow yield and yield to maturity}@}. The relationship between {@{yield and term to maturity}@} \(or alternatively between {@{yield and the weighted mean term}@} allowing for {@{both interest and capital repayment}@}\) for {@{otherwise identical bonds}@} derives {@{the [yield curve](yield%20curve.md)}@}, {@{a graph plotting this relationship}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-09,3,303!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306-->

If the bond {@{includes [embedded options](embedded%20option.md)}@}, the valuation is {@{more difficult}@} and combines {@{[option pricing](option%20pricing.md) with discounting}@}. Depending on {@{the type of option}@}, {@{the [option price](option%20premium.md) as calculated}@} is either {@{added to or subtracted from the price of the "straight" portion}@}. See further under {@{[Bond option Â§ Embedded options](bond%20option.md#embedded%20options)}@}. {@{This total}@} is then {@{the value of the bond}@}. {@{More sophisticated [lattice-](lattice%20model%20(finance).md#hybrid%20securities) or [simulation-based techniques](Monte%20Carlo%20methods%20for%20option%20pricing.md)}@} may {@{\(also\) be employed}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274-->

{@{Bond markets}@}, unlike {@{stock or share markets}@}, sometimes {@{do not have a centralized exchange or trading system}@}.

Bonds are {@{bought and traded mostly by institutions}@} like {@{[central banks](central%20bank.md), [sovereign wealth funds](sovereign%20wealth%20fund.md), [pension funds](pension%20fund.md)}@}, {@{[insurance companies](insurance%20companies.md#insurance%20companies), [hedge funds](hedge%20fund.md), and [banks](bank.md)}@}. {@{Insurance companies and pension funds}@} have {@{liabilities}@} which essentially include {@{fixed amounts payable on predetermined dates}@}. They {@{buy the bonds}@} to {@{match their liabilities}@}, and may be {@{compelled by law to do this}@}. {@{Most individuals who want to own bonds}@} do so through {@{[bond funds](bond%20fund.md)}@}. Still, in {@{the U.S.}@}, {@{nearly 10% of all bonds outstanding}@} are {@{held directly by households}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,323!2025-07-10,4,306-->

{@{The volatility of bonds}@} \(especially {@{short and medium dated bonds}@}\) is {@{lower than that of equities \(stocks\)}@}. Thus, bonds are generally viewed as {@{safer investments than equities}@}, but {@{this perception is only partially correct}@}. Bonds do {@{suffer from less day-to-day volatility than stocks}@}, and {@{bonds' interest payments}@} are sometimes {@{higher than the general level of [dividend](dividend.md) payments}@}. Bonds are {@{often liquid}@} â it is often {@{fairly easy for an institution to sell a large quantity of bonds}@} without {@{affecting the price much}@}, which may be {@{more difficult for equities}@} â and {@{the comparative certainty of a fixed interest payment twice a year and a fixed lump sum at maturity}@} is {@{attractive}@}. Bondholders also {@{enjoy a measure of legal protection}@}: under {@{the law of most countries}@}, if {@{a company goes [bankrupt](bankruptcy.md)}@}, its bondholders will often {@{receive some money back \(the [recovery amount](recovery%20amount.md)\)}@}, whereas {@{the company's equity stock}@} often {@{ends up valueless}@}.

- {@{Bond prices can become volatile}@} depending on {@{the credit rating of the issuer}@} â for instance if {@{the [credit rating agencies](credit%20rating%20agency.md)}@} like {@{[Standard & Poor's](Standard%20&%20Poor's.md) and [Moody's](Moody's.md)}@} {@{upgrade or downgrade the credit rating of the issuer}@}. {@{An unanticipated downgrade}@} will cause {@{the market price of the bond to fall}@}. As with {@{interest rate risk}@}, this risk {@{does not affect the bond's interest payments}@} \(provided {@{the issuer does not actually default}@}\), but puts {@{at risk the market price}@}, which affects {@{mutual funds holding these bonds}@}, and {@{holders of individual bonds who may have to sell them}@}.
- {@{A company's bondholders}@} may {@{lose much or all their money}@} if {@{the company goes [bankrupt](bankrupt.md)}@}. Under {@{the laws of many countries \(including the United States and Canada\)}@}, bondholders are {@{in line to receive the proceeds of the sale of the assets of a liquidated company}@} {@{ahead of some other creditors}@}. {@{Bank lenders, deposit holders \(in the case of a deposit taking institution such as a bank\) and trade creditors}@} may {@{take precedence}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,323-->

  There is {@{no guarantee of how much money will remain}@} to {@{repay bondholders}@}. As an example, after {@{an accounting scandal and a [Chapter 11](Chapter%2011.md) bankruptcy}@} at {@{the giant telecommunications company [Worldcom](MCI%20Inc..md), in 2004}@} its bondholders {@{ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar}@}.<sup>[\[17\]](#^ref-17)</sup> In {@{a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation}@}, bondholders may {@{end up having the value of their bonds reduced}@}, often through {@{an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-11,4,294!2025-07-10,4,301!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,320!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306-->

- {@{Some bonds are callable}@}, meaning that even though the company has {@{agreed to make payments plus interest towards the debt for a certain period of time}@}, the company can {@{choose to pay off the bond early}@}. This {@{creates [reinvestment risk](reinvestment%20risk.md)}@}, meaning {@{the investor is forced to find a new place for their money}@}, and the investor {@{might not be able to find as good a deal}@}, especially because {@{this usually happens when interest rates are falling}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306-->

### bond indices

- See also: ::@:: [Bond market index](bond%20market%20index.md) <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306-->

{@{A number of bond indices exist}@} for the purposes of {@{managing portfolios and measuring performance}@}, similar to {@{the [S&P 500](S&P%20500.md) or [Russell Indexes](Russell%20Indexes.md) for companies' shares}@}. {@{The most common American benchmarks}@} are {@{the [Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate](Bloomberg%20Barclays%20US%20Aggregate%20Bond%20Index.md) \(ex Lehman Aggregate\), [Citigroup BIG](Citigroup%20BIG.md) and [Merrill Lynch Domestic Master](Merrill%20Lynch%20Domestic%20Master.md)}@}. Most indices are {@{parts of families of broader indices}@} that can be used to {@{measure global bond portfolios}@}, or may be further {@{subdivided by maturity or sector}@} for {@{managing specialized portfolios}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,274!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,306!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,325!2025-07-10,4,306-->
