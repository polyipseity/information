# optical telescope

## characteristics

### angular resolution

Ignoring {@{blurring of the image by turbulence in the atmosphere ([atmospheric seeing](astronomical%20seeing.md)) and optical imperfections of the telescope}@}, the [angular resolution](angular%20resolution.md) of an optical telescope is determined by {@{the diameter of the [primary mirror](primary%20mirror.md) or lens gathering the light (also termed its "aperture")}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-28,127,290!2025-07-12,270,330-->

{@{The [Rayleigh criterion](angular%20resolution.md#Rayleigh's%20criterion)}@} for the resolution limit {@{$\alpha_R$ (in radians)}@} is given by {@{$$\sin(\alpha_R) = 1.22 \frac \lambda D \qquad (\text{note that }\sin(\alpha_R) \approx \alpha_R\text{ for small }\alpha_R)$$}@}, where {@{$\lambda$ is the [wavelength](wavelength.md) and $D$ is the aperture}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-16,301,330!2025-02-09,148,310!2025-07-21,279,330!2025-07-21,279,330-->

### light-gathering power

- see: [etendue](etendue.md)

The light-gathering power of an optical telescope, also referred to as {@{light grasp or aperture gain}@}, is {@{the ability of a telescope to collect a lot more [light](light.md) than the [human eye](human%20eye.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-09,168,310!2025-09-10,292,290-->

It is proportional to {@{square of the aperture $D$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-13,248,330-->
