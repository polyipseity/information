# optical telescope

## characteristics

### angular resolution

Ignoring {@{blurring of the image by turbulence in the atmosphere ([atmospheric seeing](astronomical%20seeing.md)) and optical imperfections of the telescope}@}, the [angular resolution](angular%20resolution.md) of an optical telescope is determined by {@{the diameter of the [primary mirror](primary%20mirror.md) or lens gathering the light (also termed its "aperture")}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-28,516,310!2028-11-20,1227,350-->

{@{The [Rayleigh criterion](angular%20resolution.md#Rayleigh's%20criterion)}@} for the resolution limit {@{$\alpha_R$ (in radians)}@} is given by {@{$$\sin(\alpha_R) = 1.22 \frac \lambda D \qquad (\text{note that }\sin(\alpha_R) \approx \alpha_R\text{ for small }\alpha_R)$$}@}, where {@{$\lambda$ is the [wavelength](wavelength.md) and $D$ is the aperture}@}. <!--SR:!2029-05-26,1377,350!2026-05-14,459,310!2029-01-06,1265,350!2029-01-15,1274,350-->

### light-gathering power

- see: [etendue](etendue.md)

The light-gathering power of an optical telescope, also referred to as {@{light grasp or aperture gain}@}, is {@{the ability of a telescope to collect a lot more [light](light.md) than the [human eye](human%20eye.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-02-28,721,330!2025-09-10,292,290-->

It is proportional to {@{square of the aperture $D$}@}. <!--SR:!2028-07-15,1128,350-->
