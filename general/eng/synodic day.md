# synodic day

A __synodic day__ (or __synodic rotation period__ or __solar day__) is {@{the [period](rotation%20period.md) for a [celestial object](astronomical%20object.md) to rotate once in relation to the [star](star.md) it is [orbiting](orbit.md)}@}, and is the basis of {@{[solar time](solar%20time.md)}@}. As of 2008, a mean solar day for [Earth](Earth.md) is {@{about 86&nbsp;400.002 SI seconds, i.e., about 24.000&nbsp;0006 hours}@}.

The synodic day is distinguished from {@{the sidereal day, which is one complete rotation in relation to [distant stars](fixed%20stars.md)}@} and is the basis of {@{[sidereal time](sidereal%20time.md)}@}.

In the case of {@{a [tidally locked](tidal%20locking.md) [planet](planet.md), the same side always faces its parent star}@}, and its synodic day is {@{infinite. Its sidereal day, however, equals its [orbital period](orbital%20period.md)}@}.
