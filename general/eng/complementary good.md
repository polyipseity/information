In [economics](economics.md), a __complementary good__ is {@{a [good](goods.md) whose appeal increases with the popularity of its complement}@}.<!-- <sup>\[_[further explanation needed](Wikipedia:Please%20clarify.md)_\]</sup> --> Technically, it displays {@{a negative [cross elasticity of demand](cross%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md)}@} and that {@{[demand](demand.md) for it increases when the [price](price.md) of another good decreases}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> If {@{$A$ is a complement to $B$}@}, {@{an increase in the price of $A$}@} will result in {@{a negative movement along the demand curve of $A$ and cause the demand [curve](curve.md) for $B$ to [shift inward](demand%20curve.md#changes%20that%20decrease%20demand)}@}; {@{less of each good will be demanded}@}. Conversely, {@{a decrease in the price of $A$}@} will result in {@{a positive movement along the demand curve of $A$ and cause the demand curve of $B$ to [shift outward](demand%20curve.md#changes%20that%20increase%20demand)}@}; {@{more of each good will be demanded}@}. This is in contrast to {@{a [substitute good](substitute%20good.md)}@}, whose {@{demand decreases when its substitute's price decreases}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-11-16,1139,350!2027-12-26,814,330!2025-11-11,278,330!2028-07-27,1050,350!2027-12-24,855,330!2027-07-04,722,330!2025-11-24,290,330!2025-11-06,275,330!2025-10-08,253,330!2025-10-16,257,330!2027-08-28,773,330-->

When {@{two goods are complements}@}, they experience {@{_joint demand_ - the demand of one good is linked to the demand for another good}@}. Therefore, if {@{a higher quantity is demanded of one good, a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other, and _vice versa_}@}. For example, {@{the demand for razor blades}@} may {@{depend on the number of razors in use}@}; this is why {@{razors have sometimes been sold as [loss leaders](loss%20leader.md)}@}, to {@{increase demand for the associated blades}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> Another example is that {@{sometimes a toothbrush is packaged free with toothpaste}@}. The toothbrush is {@{a complement to the toothpaste}@}; the [cost of producing](manufacturing%20cost.md) a toothbrush {@{may be higher than toothpaste}@}, but {@{its sales depends on the demand of toothpaste}@}. <!--SR:!2028-11-14,1137,350!2025-10-10,255,330!2025-11-16,283,330!2025-10-21,261,330!2025-10-11,254,330!2025-10-27,266,330!2027-07-21,735,330!2025-10-06,251,330!2025-11-19,285,330!2027-04-26,682,330!2025-11-29,294,330-->

{@{All non-complementary goods}@} can be {@{considered substitutes}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> If {@{$x$ and $y$ are rough complements in an everyday sense}@}, then consumers are {@{[willing to pay](willingness%20to%20pay.md) more for each [marginal unit](marginal%20product.md) of good $x$ as they accumulate more $y$}@}. The opposite is {@{true for substitutes}@}: the consumer is {@{willing to pay less for each marginal unit of good "$z$" as it accumulates more of good "$y$"}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-17,258,330!2025-10-14,256,330!2025-11-23,289,330!2025-10-07,252,330!2025-10-23,263,330!2028-09-30,1101,350-->

Complementarity may be driven by {@{[psychological processes](psychology.md) in which the consumption of one good \(e.g., cola\) stimulates demand for its complements \(e.g., a cheeseburger\)}@}. Consumption of a food or beverage {@{[activates a goal](goal%20setting.md) to consume its complements}@}: {@{foods that consumers believe would taste better together}@}. {@{Drinking cola}@} increases {@{consumers' willingness to pay for a cheeseburger}@}. This effect appears to be {@{contingent on [consumer perceptions](consumer%20behaviour.md) of these relationships rather than their sensory properties}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2027-04-04,662,330!2028-10-23,1119,350!2028-11-11,1133,350!2027-05-23,699,330!2026-11-05,524,310!2025-11-29,294,330-->

## examples

> {@{![Supply and demand of cars when the price of petrol decreases](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Supply-and-demand.svg)}@}
>
> {@{Supply and demand of cars when the price of petrol decreases}@} <!--SR:!2025-10-20,260,330!2025-10-14,256,330-->

An example of this would be {@{the demand for [cars](car.md) and [petrol](gasoline.md)}@}. The [supply and demand](supply%20and%20demand.md) for cars is represented by {@{the figure, with the initial demand $D_{1}$}@}. Suppose that the initial price of cars is represented by {@{$P_{1}$ with a quantity demanded of $Q_{1}$}@}. If {@{the price of petrol were to decrease by some amount}@}, this would result in {@{a higher quantity of cars demanded}@}. This higher quantity demanded would {@{cause the demand curve to [shift rightward](demand%20curve.md#shift%20of%20a%20demand%20curve) to a new position $D_{2}$}@}. Assuming {@{a constant supply curve $S$ of cars}@}, {@{the new increased quantity demanded will be at $Q_{2}$ with a new increased price $P_{2}$}@}. Other examples include {@{automobiles and fuel, mobile phones and cellular service, printer and cartridge, among others}@}. <!--SR:!2028-09-19,1093,350!2025-11-13,280,330!2025-10-26,265,330!2025-11-23,289,330!2025-11-22,288,330!2025-10-13,255,330!2028-10-09,1108,350!2025-11-28,293,330!2025-11-18,285,330-->

## perfect complement

> {@{![Indifference curve for perfect complements](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Indifference-curves-perfect-complements.svg)}@}
>
> {@{[Indifference curve](indifference%20curve.md) for perfect complements}@} <!--SR:!2025-10-25,264,330!2025-11-07,276,330-->

{@{A _perfect complement_}@} is {@{a good that _must_ be consumed with another good}@}. {@{The [indifference curve](indifference%20curve.md) of a perfect complement}@} {@{exhibits a right angle}@}, as illustrated by the figure.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> Such preferences can be represented by {@{a [Leontief utility](Leontief%20utilities.md) function}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-11,254,330!2025-11-21,287,330!2025-10-15,256,330!2028-11-22,1144,350!2025-10-19,183,270-->

{@{Few goods}@} behave as {@{perfect complements}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> One example is {@{a left shoe and a right}@}; shoes are {@{naturally sold in pairs}@}, and the ratio between {@{sales of left and right shoes will never shift noticeably from 1:1}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-28,293,330!2025-11-12,279,330!2028-09-25,1097,350!2028-09-26,1099,350!2028-11-06,1131,350-->

{@{The degree of complementarity}@}, however, does not {@{have to be mutual}@}; it can be {@{measured by the [cross price elasticity of demand](cross%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md)}@}. In {@{the case of video games}@}, a specific video game \(the complement good\) {@{has to be consumed with a video game console \(the base good\)}@}. It does not {@{work the other way: a video game console does not have to be consumed with that game}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-28,267,330!2028-09-01,1078,350!2025-11-14,281,330!2028-11-21,1143,350!2025-10-13,255,330!2025-11-29,294,330-->

### example

In [marketing](marketing.md), complementary goods {@{give additional [market power](market%20power.md) to the producer}@}. It allows {@{[vendor lock-in](vendor%20lock-in.md) by increasing [switching costs](switching%20barriers.md)}@}. {@{A few types of [pricing strategy](pricing%20strategies.md) exist}@} for {@{a complementary good and its base good}@}: <!--SR:!2028-10-06,1106,350!2027-08-29,764,330!2025-11-10,277,330!2025-11-24,290,330-->

- Pricing the base good at a relatively low price - ::@:: this approach allows easy entry by consumers \(e.g. low-price consumer printer vs. high-price cartridge\) <!--SR:!2027-09-09,783,330!2025-10-26,264,330-->
- Pricing the base good at a relatively high price to the complementary good - ::@:: this approach creates a barrier to entry and exit \(e.g., a costly car vs inexpensive gas\) <!--SR:!2025-11-17,283,330!2025-10-09,254,330-->

## gross complements

Sometimes {@{the complement-relationship between two goods is not intuitive}@} and must be {@{verified by inspecting the cross-elasticity of demand using market data}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-09,276,330!2027-12-04,798,330-->

{@{Mosak's definition}@} states "{@{a good $x$ is a gross complement of $y$ if ${\frac {\partial f_{x}(p,\omega )}{\partial p_{y} } }$ is negative}@}, where {@{$f_{i}(p,\omega )$ for $i=1,2,\ldots ,n$ denotes the ordinary individual demand for a certain good}@}." In fact, in Mosak's case, $x$ is {@{not a gross complement of $y$ but $y$ is a gross complement of $x$}@}. The elasticity {@{does not need to be symmetrical}@}. Thus, $y$ is {@{a gross complement of $x$ while $x$ can simultaneously be a gross substitutes for $y$}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-18,259,330!2025-10-12,255,330!2027-10-08,808,330!2028-11-13,1137,350!2028-08-09,1060,350!2025-11-29,294,330-->

### proof

{@{The standard [Hicks](John%20Hicks.md) decomposition of the effect}@} on {@{the ordinary demand for a good $x$ of a simple price change in a good $y$}@}, {@{utility level $\tau ^{*}$ and chosen bundle $z^{*}=(x^{*},y^{*},\dots )$}@} is {@{$${\frac {\partial f_{x}(p,\omega )}{\partial p_{y} } }={\frac {\partial h_{x}(p,\tau ^{*})}{\partial p_{y} } }-y^{*}{\frac {\partial f_{x}(p,\omega )}{\partial \omega } }$$}@} (annotation: The first term of the right-hand side is {@{the complement/[substitution effect](substitution%20effect.md) while the second term is the [income effect](consumer%20choice.md#income%20effect)}@}.) If $x$ is {@{a gross substitute for $y$}@}, {@{the left-hand side of the equation and the first term of right-hand side are positive}@}. By {@{the symmetry of Mosak's perspective}@}, evaluating {@{the equation with respect to $x^{*}$}@}, {@{the first term of right-hand side stays the same}@} while {@{some extreme cases exist where $x^{*}$ is large enough to make the whole right-hand-side negative}@}. In this case, {@{$y$ is a gross complement of $x$}@}. Overall, {@{$x$ and $y$ are not symmetrical}@}. <!--SR:!2028-07-29,1051,350!2027-06-15,716,330!2028-09-06,1083,350!2026-06-14,380,290!2026-06-11,430,310!2025-11-29,294,330!2026-11-01,501,310!2027-06-30,719,330!2025-11-27,292,330!2027-06-12,646,310!2025-10-22,262,330!2025-10-10,255,330!2025-10-11,254,330-->
