# brown dwarf

__Brown dwarfs__ are {@{[substellar objects](substellar%20object.md) that have more mass than the biggest [gas giant](gas%20giant.md) planets, but less than the least massive [main-sequence](main%20sequence.md) [stars](star.md)}@}. Their mass is {@{approximately 13 to 80 [times that of Jupiter](jupiter%20mass.md) (M<sub>J</sub>)}@}â€”{@{not big enough to sustain [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) of ordinary [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) ([<sup>1</sup>H](isotopes%20of%20hydrogen.md#hydrogen-1%20(protium))) into [helium](helium.md) in their cores, but massive enough to emit some light and heat from the [fusion of deuterium](deuterium%20fusion.md) ([<sup>2</sup>H](deuterium.md))}@}. The most massive ones {@{(> 65 M<sub>J</sub>) can [fuse lithium](lithium%20burning.md) ([<sup>7</sup>Li](isotopes%20of%20lithium.md#lithium-7))}@}.
