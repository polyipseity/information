# adjusting entries

In [accounting](accounting.md), __adjusting entries__ are {@{[journal](general%20journal.md) entries usually made at the end of an accounting period to allocate [income](income.md) and [expenditure](expense.md) to the period in which they actually occurred}@}. {@{The [revenue recognition principle](revenue%20recognition.md)}@} is {@{the basis of making adjusting entries that pertain to unearned and accrued revenues under [accrual-basis accounting](accrual.md)}@}. They are sometimes called {@{Balance Day adjustments because they are made on balance day}@}.

Based on {@{the [matching principle](matching%20principle.md) of [accrual accounting](accrual.md)}@}, {@{[revenues](revenue.md) and associated [costs](cost.md) are recognized in the same accounting period}@}. However {@{the actual cash may be received or paid at a different time}@}.

## types of adjusting entries

Most adjusting entries could be classified this way: {@{prepaid expenses, accrued expenses, unearned revenues, accrued revenues}@}.

|          | __Prepayments__ ([Deferral](deferral.md) - cash paid or received before consumption)                | __[Accrual](accrual.md)__ - cash paid or received after consumption                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Expenses | Prepaid expenses: for expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used             | Accrued expenses: for expenses incurred but not yet paid in cash and not yet recorded   |
| Revenues | Unearned revenues: for revenues received in cash and recorded as liabilities before they are earned | Accrued revenues: for revenues earned but not yet recorded and not yet received in cash |

- prepaid expenses ::@:: for expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used
- accrued expenses ::@:: for expenses incurred but not yet paid in cash and not yet recorded
- unearned revenues ::@:: for revenues received in cash and recorded as liabilities before they are earned
- accrued revenues ::@:: for revenues earned but not yet recorded and not yet received in cash

### prepayments

{@{Adjusting entries for prepayments}@} are necessary to {@{account for cash that has been received prior to delivery of goods or completion of services}@}. When {@{this cash is paid, it is first recorded in a prepaid expense asset account}@}; the account is {@{to be expensed either with the passage of time (e.g. rent, insurance) or through use and consumption (e.g. supplies)}@}.

{@{A company receiving the cash for benefits yet to be delivered}@} will have to {@{record the amount in an unearned revenue [liability](liability%20(financial%20accounting).md) account}@}. Then, {@{an adjusting entry to recognize the revenue is used as necessary}@}.

#### example

Assume {@{a magazine publishing company charges an annual subscription fee of $12}@}. The cash is {@{paid up-front at the start of the subscription}@}. The income, based on {@{[sales basis method](revenue%20recognition.md), is recognized upon delivery}@}. Therefore, the initial reporting of the receipt of annual subscription fee is indicated as:

```text
                        Debit  |  Credit
                        ----------------
Cash                     $12   |         
  Unearned Revenue             |   $12
                               |
```

The adjusting entry reporting each month after the delivery is:

```text
                        Debit  |  Credit
                        ----------------
Unearned Revenue           $1  |   
  Revenue                      |    $1  
                               |
```

The unearned revenue after the first month is {@{therefore $11 and revenue reported in the income statement is $1}@}.

### accruals

Accrued revenues are {@{revenues that have been recognized (that is, services have been performed or goods have been delivered), but their cash payment have not yet been recorded or received}@}. When the revenue is recognized, it is recorded as {@{a receivable}@}.

Accrued expenses {@{have not yet been paid for, so they are recorded in a payable account}@}. {@{Expenses for interest, taxes, rent, and salaries}@} are commonly accrued for reporting purposes.

{@{An income which has been earned but it has not been received yet during the accounting period}@}, like {@{rent, interest on investments, commission etc.}@} are examples of accrued income.

### estimates

A third classification of adjusting entry occurs {@{where the exact amount of an expense cannot easily be determined}@}. {@{The [depreciation](depreciation.md) of fixed assets}@}, for example, is {@{an expense which has to be estimated}@}.

The entry for bad debt expense can also be classified as an estimate.

### inventory

In {@{a periodic [inventory](inventory.md) system}@}, an adjusting entry is used to {@{determine the [cost of goods sold](cost%20of%20goods%20sold.md) expense}@}. This entry is {@{not necessary for a company using [perpetual inventory](perpetual%20inventory.md)}@}.
