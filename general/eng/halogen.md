# halogen

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../../tools/utility.py.md
```

The __halogens__ {@{consist of the [chemical elements](chemical%20element.md) [fluorine](fluorine.md) (F), [chlorine](chlorine.md) (Cl), [bromine](bromine.md) (Br), [iodine](iodine.md) (I), [astatine](astatine.md) (As), and [tennessine](tennessine.md) (Ts)}@}. The halogens are {@{all colored, increasingly dark down the group, and [reactive](reactivity%20(chemistry).md)}@}.

The color darkens as the group is descended. Flourine is {@{very pale yellow, chlorine is greenish-yellow, bromine is reddish-brown, and iodine is violet}@}.

## representative reactions

Halogens {@{can form [ionic compounds](ionic%20compound.md) with [metals](metal.md) and [covalent compounds](covalent%20compound.md) with [nonmetals](nonmetal.md)}@}.

### reaction with hydrogen

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
i_or_below = 'reacts partially; virtually no reaction'
return await memorize_map(
  __env__.cwf_sects('49d8', '2394', '6900'),
  items_to_map(
    ('[fluorine](fluorine.md)', 'reacts explosively in the dark and cold',),
    ('[chlorine](chlorine.md)', 'reacts explosively in light and heat; slowly without',),
    ('[bromine](bromine.md)', 'reacts explosively in flames; moderately in light and heat',),
    ('[iodine](iodine.md)', i_or_below,),
    ('[astatine](astatine.md)', i_or_below,),
    ('[tennessine](tennessine.md)', 'unknown',),
  ),
)
```
