# reflection nebula

In [astronomy](astronomy.md), __reflection nebulae__ are {@{[clouds](interstellar%20cloud.md) of [interstellar dust](cosmic%20dust.md) which might reflect the light of a nearby [star](star.md) or stars}@}. The energy from the nearby stars is {@{insufficient to [ionize](ionization.md) the gas of the nebula to create an [emission nebula](emission%20nebula.md), but is enough to give sufficient [scattering](scattering.md) to make the dust visible}@}. Thus, the [frequency spectrum](spectral%20density.md#explanation) shown by reflection nebulae is {@{similar to that of the illuminating stars}@}.
