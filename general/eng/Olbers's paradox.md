# Olbers's paradox

__Olbers's paradox__, also known as {@{the __dark night paradox__ or __Olbers and Cheseaux's paradox__}@}, is {@{an argument in [astrophysics](astrophysics.md) and [physical cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md) that says that the [darkness](darkness.md) of the [night sky](night%20sky.md) conflicts with the assumption of an infinite and eternal [static universe](static%20universe.md)}@}. In {@{the hypothetical case that the universe is static, [homogeneous](homogeneity%20and%20heterogeneity.md) at a large scale, and populated by an infinite number of [stars](star.md)}@}, {@{any line of sight from [Earth](Earth.md) must end at the surface of a star}@} and hence {@{the night sky should be completely illuminated and very bright. This contradicts the observed darkness and non-uniformity of the night sky}@}. <!--SR:!2028-12-27,1238,350!2028-01-25,944,330!2026-09-08,524,310!2028-03-19,1017,350!2028-07-21,1116,350-->
