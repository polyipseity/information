# stellar evolution

__Stellar evolution__ is {@{the process by which a [star](star.md) changes over the course of its lifetime and how it can lead to the creation of a new star}@}. Depending on {@{the mass of the star}@}, its lifetime can range from {@{a few million years for the most massive to trillions of years for the least massive, which is considerably longer than the current [age of the universe](age%20of%20the%20universe.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-21,481,308!2025-12-25,389,328!2026-05-25,453,308-->

## mature stars

### mid-sized stars

Stars of {@{roughly 0.6–10 M<sub>☉</sub>}@} become {@{[red giants](red%20giant.md), which are large non-[main-sequence](main%20sequence.md) stars of [stellar classification](stellar%20classification.md) K or M}@}. Red giants lie {@{along the right edge of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram due to their red color and large luminosity}@}. Examples include [Aldebaran](aldebaran.md) in the constellation [Taurus](taurus%20(constellation).md) and [Arcturus](arcturus.md) in the constellation of [Boötes](boötes.md). <!--SR:!2025-12-21,329,268!2025-06-12,204,270!2025-03-10,164,310-->

Mid-sized stars are {@{red giants during two different phases of their post-main-sequence evolution}@}: {@{red-giant-branch stars, with inert cores made of helium and hydrogen-burning shells, and asymptotic-giant-branch stars, with inert cores made of carbon and helium-burning shells inside the hydrogen-burning shells}@}. Between these two phases, {@{stars spend a period on the [horizontal branch](horizontal%20branch.md) with a helium-fusing core}@}. Many of these helium-fusing stars {@{cluster towards the cool end of the horizontal branch as K-type giants and are referred to as [red clump](red%20clump.md) giants}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-01,234,328!2025-07-02,227,288!2026-01-16,370,308!2025-09-02,233,248-->

#### subgiant phase

- see: [subgiant](subgiant.md)

When {@{a star exhausts the hydrogen in its core}@}, it {@{leaves the main sequence and begins to fuse hydrogen in a shell outside the core (but also see below)}@}. The core {@{increases in mass as the shell produces more helium}@}. Depending on {@{the mass of the helium core, this continues for several million to one or two billion years}@}, with the star {@{expanding and cooling at a similar or slightly lower luminosity to its main sequence state (moving right in the HR diagram)}@}. Eventually {@{either the core becomes degenerate, in stars around the mass of the sun}@}, or {@{the outer layers cool sufficiently to become opaque, in more massive stars}@}. Either of these changes cause {@{the hydrogen shell to increase in temperature and the [luminosity](luminosity.md) of the star to increase}@}, at which point the {@{star expands onto the red-giant branch}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-30,393,328!2025-10-24,295,288!2025-10-02,281,288!2025-11-21,356,308!2025-12-14,322,270!2025-10-09,295,290!2025-03-02,160,310!2025-08-28,280,290!2026-06-14,520,328-->

For stars {@{similar to or larger (but not much larger) than the solar mass}@}, after core hydrogen is exhausted, it {@{does not immediately begin to fuse hydrogen in the shell and enter the subgiant phase}@}. Instead, {@{fusion ceases entirely, and the energy is provided by gravitational contraction}@}, with {@{the entire star contracting, but increasing in temperature enough that luminosity increases (moving left and slightly upward in the HR diagram)}@}. (For stars close to 1 solar mass, {@{only the core contracts, and the outer shell expands and cools instead, though the luminosity still increases}@}.) Only when, {@{after several million years, the core temperature heats up enough for hydrogen shell fusion to start again}@}, and {@{the subgiant phase starts}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-02,150,308!2025-04-26,207,328!2025-12-04,366,310!2025-03-04,135,268!2025-03-29,144,248!2025-09-13,293,290!2026-07-10,521,310-->

#### red-giant-branch phase

- see: [red-giant branch](red-giant%20branch.md)

The expanding outer layers of the star are {@{[convective](convection.md), with the material being mixed by turbulence from near the fusing regions up to the surface of the star}@}. For {@{all but the lowest-mass stars}@}, {@{the fused material has remained deep in the stellar interior}@} prior to this point, so the convecting envelope makes {@{fusion products visible at the star's surface for the first time}@}. At this stage of evolution, {@{the results are subtle, with the largest effects, alterations to the [isotopes](isotope.md) of hydrogen and helium, being unobservable}@}. {@{The effects of the [CNO cycle](CNO%20cycle.md)}@} appear at the surface during the first [dredge-up](dredge-up.md), with {@{lower <sup>12</sup>C/<sup>13</sup>C ratios and altered proportions of carbon and nitrogen}@}. These are {@{detectable with [spectroscopy](spectroscopy.md) and have been measured for many evolved stars}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-13,242,270!2027-02-25,728,348!2025-07-29,271,308!2025-12-23,380,310!2025-07-19,224,270!2026-06-26,486,310!2025-04-11,166,270!2025-11-09,332,290-->

The helium core {@{continues to grow}@} on the red-giant branch. It is {@{no longer in thermal equilibrium, either degenerate or above the [Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit](Schönberg–Chandrasekhar%20limit.md)}@}, so it {@{increases in temperature which causes the rate of fusion in the hydrogen shell to increase}@}. The star {@{increases in luminosity towards the [tip of the red-giant branch](tip%20of%20the%20red-giant%20branch.md)}@}. Red-giant-branch stars {@{with a degenerate helium core all reach the tip with very similar core masses and very similar luminosities}@}, although {@{the more massive of the red giants become hot enough to ignite helium fusion before that point}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,165,328!2026-02-13,382,290!2026-01-06,366,308!2026-02-16,392,308!2026-03-06,371,270!2025-03-01,134,268-->

#### horizontal branch

- see: [horizontal branch](horizontal%20branch.md), [red clump](red%20clump.md)

In {@{the helium cores of stars in the 0.6 to 2.0 solar mass range}@}, which are {@{largely supported by [electron degeneracy pressure](electron%20degeneracy%20pressure.md)}@}, helium fusion will {@{ignite on a timescale of days in a [helium flash](helium%20flash.md)}@}. In the nondegenerate cores of more massive stars, {@{the ignition of helium fusion occurs relatively slowly with no flash}@}. The nuclear power released during the helium flash is {@{very large, on the order of 10<sup>8</sup> times the luminosity of the Sun for a few days and 10<sup>11</sup> times the luminosity of the Sun (roughly the luminosity of the [Milky Way Galaxy](Milky%20Way.md)) for a few seconds}@}. However, the energy is {@{consumed by the thermal expansion of the initially degenerate core and thus cannot be seen from outside the star}@}. Due to the expansion of the core, {@{the hydrogen fusion in the overlying layers slows and total energy generation decreases}@}. The star {@{contracts, although not all the way to the main sequence, and it migrates to the [horizontal branch](horizontal%20branch.md) on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, gradually shrinking in radius, increasing its surface temperature, and decreasing its luminosity}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,147,250!2025-12-18,355,288!2025-08-25,286,308!2025-08-21,299,330!2025-08-01,216,248!2025-04-02,154,268!2026-01-21,351,248!2026-05-24,451,270-->

Core helium flash stars {@{evolve to the red end of the horizontal branch but do not migrate to higher temperatures before they gain a degenerate carbon-oxygen core and start helium shell burning}@}. These stars are {@{often observed as a [red clump](red%20clump.md) of stars in the colour-magnitude diagram of a cluster, hotter and less luminous than the red giants}@}. Higher-mass stars {@{with larger helium cores move along the horizontal branch to higher temperatures}@}, some becoming {@{unstable pulsating stars in the yellow [instability strip](instability%20strip.md) ([RR Lyrae variables](RR%20Lyrae%20variable.md)), whereas some become even hotter and can form a blue tail or blue hook to the horizontal branch}@}. The morphology of the horizontal branch depends on {@{parameters such as metallicity, age, and helium content}@}, but the exact details are still being modelled. <!--SR:!2025-04-07,140,230!2025-09-27,287,268!2025-08-23,266,268!2025-05-12,151,228!2026-01-14,386,308-->

#### asymptotic-giant-branch phase

- see: [asymptotic giant branch](asymptotic%20giant%20phase.md)

After a star {@{has consumed the helium at the core}@}, {@{hydrogen and helium fusion continues in shells around a hot core of [carbon](carbon.md) and [oxygen](oxygen.md)}@}. The star {@{follows the [asymptotic giant branch](asymptotic%20giant%20branch.md) on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, paralleling the original red-giant evolution, but with even faster energy generation (which lasts for a shorter time)}@}. Although helium is being burnt in a shell, {@{the majority of the energy is produced by hydrogen burning in a shell further from the core of the star}@}. Helium from these hydrogen burning shells {@{drops towards the center of the star}@} and {@{periodically the energy output from the helium shell increases dramatically}@}. This is known as {@{a [thermal pulse](asymptotic%20giant%20branch.md#AGB%20stage) and they occur towards the end of the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, sometimes even into the post-asymptotic-giant-branch phase}@}. Depending on mass and composition, there may be {@{several to hundreds of thermal pulses}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-23,480,328!2025-10-09,322,308!2026-01-15,339,268!2025-11-19,354,310!2026-10-31,623,328!2026-02-11,408,308!2025-12-07,368,308!2025-09-29,299,288-->

#### post-AGB

- see: [post-AGB star](post-AGB%20star.md)

These mid-range stars ultimately {@{reach the tip of the asymptotic-giant-branch and run out of fuel for shell burning}@}. They are {@{not sufficiently massive to start full-scale carbon fusion}@}, so they {@{contract again, going through a period of post-asymptotic-giant-branch superwind to produce a planetary nebula with an extremely hot central star}@}. The central star then {@{cools to a white dwarf}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,184,288!2026-09-02,556,310!2025-09-05,237,250!2025-04-12,195,328-->

### massive stars

- see: [supergiant](supergiant.md)

In massive stars, the core is {@{already large enough at the onset of the hydrogen burning shell that helium ignition will occur before electron degeneracy pressure has a chance to become prevalent}@}. Thus, when {@{these stars expand and cool}@}, they {@{do not brighten as dramatically as lower-mass stars}@}; however, they were {@{more luminous on the main sequence and they evolve to highly luminous supergiants}@}. Their cores become {@{massive enough that they cannot support themselves by [electron degeneracy](electron%20degeneracy%20pressure.md) and will eventually collapse to produce a [neutron star](neutron%20star.md) or [black hole](black%20hole.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,174,328!2025-04-08,192,328!2025-03-08,160,288!2025-04-22,169,268!2026-02-26,392,270-->

#### supernova

- see: [supernova](supernova.md)

When {@{the core of a massive star collapses}@}, it will {@{form a [neutron star](neutron%20star.md), or in the case of cores that exceed the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, a [black hole](black%20hole.md)}@}. Through {@{a process that is not completely understood}@}, some of the [gravitational potential energy](gravitational%20energy.md) {@{released by this core collapse is converted into a Type Ib, Type Ic, or Type II [supernova](supernova.md)}@}. It is known that the core collapse produces {@{a massive surge of [neutrinos](neutrino.md)}@}, as observed with supernova [SN 1987A](SN%201987A.md). <!--SR:!2026-06-29,530,328!2025-04-26,191,310!2025-05-14,218,328!2025-09-13,277,288!2025-04-22,196,310-->
