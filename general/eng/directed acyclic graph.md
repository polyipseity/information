In {@{[mathematics](mathematics.md), particularly [graph theory](graph%20theory.md), and [computer science](computer%20science.md)}@}, {@{a __directed acyclic graph__ \(__DAG__\)}@} is {@{a [directed graph](directed%20graph.md) with no [directed cycles](cycle%20graph.md#directed%20cycle%20graph)}@}. That is, it consists of {@{[vertices](vertex%20(graph%20theory).md) and [edges](glossary%20of%20graph%20theory.md#edge) \(also called _arcs_\), with each edge directed from one vertex to another}@}, such that {@{following those directions will never form a closed loop}@}. A directed graph is {@{a DAG if and only if it can be [topologically ordered](topological%20sorting.md)}@}, by {@{arranging the vertices as a linear ordering that is consistent with all edge directions}@}. DAGs have {@{numerous scientific and computational applications}@}, ranging from {@{biology \(evolution, family trees, epidemiology\) to information science \(citation networks\) to computation \(scheduling\)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-06,288,330!2025-11-09,268,350!2026-01-23,332,358!2028-05-01,956,350!2025-11-05,262,330!2026-02-17,351,350!2026-01-28,335,350!2025-11-27,281,330!2027-11-04,808,338-->

## definitions

A [graph](graph%20(discrete%20mathematics).md) is formed by {@{[vertices](vertex%20(graph%20theory).md) and by [edges](glossary%20of%20graph%20theory.md#edge) connecting pairs of vertices}@}, where {@{the vertices can be any kind of object that is connected in pairs by edges}@}. In {@{the case of a [directed graph](directed%20graph.md)}@}, {@{each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex}@}. {@{A [path](path%20(graph%20theory).md) in a directed graph}@} is {@{a sequence of edges having the property that the ending vertex of each edge in the sequence is the same as the starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence}@}; a path forms {@{a cycle if the starting vertex of its first edge equals the ending vertex of its last edge}@}. A directed acyclic graph is {@{a directed graph that has no cycles}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-04-17,401,367!2028-12-16,1148,350!2026-04-17,402,367!2026-05-01,415,370!2026-02-19,356,370!2027-05-24,697,338!2028-08-01,1052,367!2026-02-08,347,370-->

{@{A vertex _v_ of a directed graph}@} is {@{said to be [reachable](reachability.md) from another vertex _u_ when there exists a path that starts at _u_ and ends at _v_}@}.

If {@{a vertex can reach itself via a nontrivial path \(a path with one or more edges\)}@}, then {@{that path is a cycle}@}, so another way to define directed acyclic graphs is that {@{they are the graphs in which no vertex can reach itself via a nontrivial path}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-04-26,411,370!2026-03-16,372,358!2026-03-22,381,370!2025-10-29,258,350!2026-03-25,380,358!2025-11-18,276,330!2026-02-04,342,358-->

{@{The [reachability relation](reachability.md) of a DAG}@} can be formalized as {@{a [partial order](partially%20ordered%20set.md#partial%20order) ≤ on the vertices of the DAG}@}. In {@{this partial order}@}, {@{two vertices _u_ and _v_ are ordered as _u_ ≤ _v_ exactly when there exists a directed path from _u_ to _v_ in the DAG}@}; that is, when {@{_u_ can reach _v_ \(or _v_ is reachable from _u_\)}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> However, {@{different DAGs may give rise to the same reachability relation and the same partial order}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> For example, {@{a DAG with two edges _u_ → _v_ and _v_ → _w_}@} has the same reachability relation as {@{the DAG with three edges _u_ → _v_, _v_ → _w_, and _u_ → _w_}@}. Both of these DAGs {@{produce the same partial order}@}, in which {@{the vertices are ordered as _u_ ≤ _v_ ≤ _w_}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-02,416,370!2025-11-02,262,350!2026-04-15,401,370!2026-03-25,381,358!2026-04-18,404,370!2028-11-17,1128,350!2028-12-10,1160,370!2026-04-01,390,370!2026-05-02,415,370!2026-03-28,383,358-->

{@{The [transitive closure](transitive%20closure.md) of a DAG}@} is {@{the graph with the most edges that has the same reachability relation as the DAG}@}. It has {@{an edge _u_ → _v_ for every pair of vertices \(_u_, _v_\) in the reachability relation ≤ of the DAG}@}, and may therefore be {@{thought of as a direct translation of the reachability relation ≤ into graph-theoretic terms}@}. The same method of {@{translating partial orders into DAGs works more generally}@}: for {@{every finite partially ordered set \(_S_, ≤\)}@}, the graph that has {@{a vertex for every element of _S_ and an edge for every pair of elements in ≤}@} is {@{automatically a transitively closed DAG}@}, and has {@{\(_S_, ≤\) as its reachability relation}@}. In this way, {@{every finite partially ordered set can be represented as a DAG}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-12,346,350!2026-04-01,390,370!2026-03-10,370,370!2026-04-30,414,370!2025-11-26,283,350!2026-04-24,407,370!2025-11-01,261,350!2026-04-28,412,370!2028-11-21,1135,358!2026-03-26,382,358-->

{@{The [transitive reduction](transitive%20reduction.md) of a DAG}@} is {@{the graph with the fewest edges that has the same reachability relation as the DAG}@}. It has {@{an edge _u_ → _v_ for every pair of vertices \(_u_, _v_\)}@} in {@{the [covering relation](covering%20relation.md) of the reachability relation ≤ of the DAG}@}.

{@{Directed acyclic graph representations of partial orderings}@} have {@{many applications in [scheduling](schedule.md) for systems of tasks with ordering constraints}@}.<sup>[\[29\]](#^ref-29)</sup> An important class of problems of this type concern {@{collections of objects that need to be updated}@}, such as {@{the cells of a [spreadsheet](spreadsheet.md)}@} after one of the cells has been changed, or {@{the [object files](object%20file.md) of a piece of computer software}@} after its [source code](source%20code.md) has been changed. In this context, {@{a [dependency graph](dependency%20graph.md)}@} is {@{a graph that has a vertex for each object to be updated, and an edge connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other}@}. {@{A cycle in this graph}@} is {@{called a [circular dependency](circular%20dependency.md), and is generally not allowed}@}, because {@{there would be no way to consistently schedule the tasks involved in the cycle}@}. {@{Dependency graphs without circular dependencies}@} {@{form DAGs}@}.<sup>[\[30\]](#^ref-30)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-08,267,330!2026-02-02,342,370!2026-03-23,379,358!2026-03-16,376,370!2026-05-01,414,370!2026-03-27,385,370!2027-09-07,768,330!2026-01-23,332,358!2026-04-29,413,370!2026-03-05,367,367!2025-12-14,297,350!2026-03-12,372,370-->

### causal structures

- see: [Bayesian network](Bayesian%20network.md)

Graphs in which {@{vertices represent events occurring at a definite time, and where the edges always point from the early time vertex to a late time vertex of the edge}@}, are {@{necessarily directed and acyclic}@}. {@{The lack of a cycle follows}@} because {@{the time associated with a vertex always increases as you follow any [path](path%20(graph%20theory).md) in the graph}@} so {@{you can never return to a vertex on a path}@}. This reflects {@{our natural intuition that causality means events can only affect the future, they never affect the past}@}, and thus {@{we have no [causal loops](temporal%20paradox.md#causal%20loop)}@}. {@{An example of this type of directed acyclic graph}@} are those {@{encountered in the [causal set approach to quantum gravity](causal%20sets.md)}@} though in this case {@{the graphs considered are [transitively complete](#transitive%20closure%20and%20transitive%20reduction)}@}. In {@{the version history example below}@}, {@{each version of the software}@} is {@{associated with a unique time, typically the time the version was saved, committed or released}@}. In {@{the citation graph examples below}@}, the documents are {@{published at one time and can only refer to older documents}@}. <!--SR:!2026-09-08,474,310!2026-04-25,410,370!2026-02-15,353,370!2028-02-27,918,350!2026-02-12,348,358!2026-03-21,380,370!2026-03-03,363,358!2025-11-14,269,330!2026-03-30,388,370!2028-06-17,993,350!2025-11-16,274,330!2026-04-30,414,370!2028-01-04,869,350!2026-04-18,404,370!2026-03-07,367,358-->

Sometimes {@{events are not associated with a specific physical time}@}. Provided that {@{pairs of events have a purely causal relationship}@}, that is {@{edges represent [causal relations](causality.md) between the events}@}, we will {@{have a directed acyclic graph}@}.<sup>[\[38\]](#^ref-38)</sup> For instance, {@{a [Bayesian network](Bayesian%20network.md)}@} represents {@{a system of probabilistic events as vertices in a directed acyclic graph}@}, in which {@{the likelihood of an event may be calculated from the likelihoods of its predecessors in the DAG}@}.<sup>[\[39\]](#^ref-39)</sup> In this context, {@{the [moral graph](moral%20graph.md) of a DAG}@} is {@{the undirected graph created by adding an \(undirected\) edge between all parents of the same vertex \(sometimes called _marrying_\)}@}, and then {@{replacing all directed edges by undirected edges}@}.<sup>[\[40\]](#^ref-40)</sup> Another type of graph with a similar causal structure is {@{an [influence diagram](influence%20diagram.md)}@}, the vertices of which {@{represent either decisions to be made or unknown information, and the edges of which represent causal influences from one vertex to another}@}.<sup>[\[41\]](#^ref-41)</sup> In {@{[epidemiology](epidemiology.md)}@}, for instance, these diagrams are {@{often used to estimate the expected value of different choices for intervention}@}.<sup>[\[42\]](#^ref-42)</sup><sup>[\[43\]](#^ref-43)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-11-10,1137,370!2026-02-20,354,358!2026-03-28,386,370!2025-12-08,290,330!2025-11-27,283,350!2026-02-09,348,370!2028-09-22,1073,358!2026-03-27,383,358!2027-11-16,820,338!2026-02-13,351,370!2026-04-02,391,370!2025-10-30,259,350!2026-03-18,375,358!2026-01-22,330,350-->

{@{The converse is also true}@}. That is {@{in any application represented by a directed acyclic graph there is a causal structure}@}, either {@{an explicit order or time in the example or an order which can be derived from graph structure}@}.

For instance {@{[transitive reduction](#transitive%20closure%20and%20transitive%20reduction)}@} gives {@{new insights into the citation distributions found in different applications}@} highlighting {@{clear differences in the mechanisms creating citations networks in different contexts}@}.<sup>[\[51\]](#^ref-51)</sup> Another technique is {@{[main path analysis](main%20path%20analysis.md)}@}, which {@{traces the citation links and suggests the most significant citation chains in a given [citation graph](citation%20graph.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,274,330!2026-04-22,405,370!2025-11-16,272,330!2026-08-29,464,310!2027-08-28,764,350!2026-03-24,382,367!2026-03-11,371,370!2029-02-08,1211,370!2026-05-01,415,370!2026-04-24,409,370!2025-10-29,257,338!2026-04-02,389,358!2026-04-23,408,370!2029-03-08,1231,370!2025-11-06,265,330!2027-05-15,673,338!2026-03-16,375,370!2026-04-27,410,370!2026-01-01,295,350!2026-05-01,415,370-->

{@{The [Price model](Price's%20model.md)}@} is {@{too simple to be a realistic model of a [citation network](citation%20graph.md)}@} but {@{it is simple enough to allow for analytic solutions for some of its properties}@}. Many of these can be found by using {@{results derived from the undirected version of the [Price model](Price's%20model.md), the [Barabási–Albert model](Barabási–Albert%20model.md)}@}. However, since {@{[Price's model](Price's%20model.md) gives a directed acyclic graph}@}, it is {@{a useful model when looking for analytic calculations of properties unique to directed acyclic graphs}@}. For instance, {@{the length of the longest path}@}, from {@{the n-th node added to the network to the first node in the network}@}, scales {@{as<sup>[\[52\]](#^ref-52)</sup> $\ln(n)$}@}. <!--SR:!2028-11-12,1125,350!2026-03-14,370,358!2026-02-21,358,370!2028-10-24,1117,358!2025-10-31,260,350!2025-11-16,273,350!2025-11-26,280,330!2029-03-04,1231,370!2027-07-24,738,330-->

### data compression

{@{Directed acyclic graphs}@} may also be {@{used as a [compact representation](data%20compression.md) of a collection of sequences}@}. In this type of application, {@{one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences}@}. When {@{many of the sequences share the same subsequences}@}, {@{these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG}@}, allowing {@{the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately}@}. For example, {@{the [directed acyclic word graph](deterministic%20acyclic%20finite%20state%20automaton.md)}@} is {@{a [data structure](data%20structure.md) in computer science}@} formed by {@{a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols}@}; {@{the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph}@} represent {@{a set of [strings](string%20(computer%20science).md), such as English words}@}.<sup>[\[53\]](#^ref-53)</sup> {@{Any set of sequences}@} can be {@{represented as paths in a tree}@}, by {@{forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence}@} and {@{making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element}@}; {@{the tree formed in this way for a set of strings}@} is {@{called a [trie](trie.md)}@}. {@{A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie}@} by {@{allowing paths to diverge and rejoin}@}, so that {@{a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex}@}.<sup>[\[54\]](#^ref-54)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-04-12,397,367!2028-01-16,886,350!2026-03-15,375,370!2026-04-16,402,370!2028-08-02,1053,367!2029-02-02,1203,370!2026-02-28,360,358!2027-10-18,807,330!2028-06-05,983,350!2028-08-23,1060,350!2026-01-24,333,358!2025-12-13,296,350!2028-02-15,896,350!2026-03-26,384,370!2027-06-15,704,330!2026-04-29,413,370!2026-03-27,386,370!2026-04-15,401,370!2026-03-15,371,358!2029-01-12,1172,350-->

{@{The same idea of using a DAG to represent a family of paths}@} occurs in {@{the [binary decision diagram](binary%20decision%20diagram.md)}@},<sup>[\[55\]](#^ref-55)</sup><sup>[\[56\]](#^ref-56)</sup> {@{a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions}@}. In {@{a binary decision diagram}@}, each non-sink vertex is {@{labeled by the name of a binary variable, and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1}@}. {@{The function value for any [truth assignment](interpretation%20(logic).md) to the variables}@} is {@{the value at the sink found by following a path, starting from the single source vertex}@}, that {@{at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex's variable}@}. Just as {@{directed acyclic word graphs can be viewed as a compressed form of tries}@}, {@{binary decision diagrams}@} can be viewed as {@{compressed forms of [decision trees](decision%20tree.md) that save space}@} by allowing {@{paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions}@}.<sup>[\[57\]](#^ref-57)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-25,307,350!2025-11-03,263,350!2026-04-11,398,367!2027-07-28,741,330!2028-11-15,1131,358!2026-02-20,357,370!2026-03-20,379,370!2027-11-18,815,330!2028-01-04,865,350!2026-02-08,344,350!2026-02-17,126,318!2025-11-11,27,394-->
