In {@{[mathematics](mathematics.md), particularly [graph theory](graph%20theory.md), and [computer science](computer%20science.md)}@}, {@{a __directed acyclic graph__ \(__DAG__\)}@} is {@{a [directed graph](directed%20graph.md) with no [directed cycles](cycle%20graph.md#directed%20cycle%20graph)}@}. That is, it consists of {@{[vertices](vertex%20(graph%20theory).md) and [edges](glossary%20of%20graph%20theory.md#edge) \(also called _arcs_\), with each edge directed from one vertex to another}@}, such that {@{following those directions will never form a closed loop}@}. A directed graph is {@{a DAG if and only if it can be [topologically ordered](topological%20sorting.md)}@}, by {@{arranging the vertices as a linear ordering that is consistent with all edge directions}@}. DAGs have {@{numerous scientific and computational applications}@}, ranging from {@{biology \(evolution, family trees, epidemiology\) to information science \(citation networks\) to computation \(scheduling\)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-21,66,310!2025-11-09,268,350!2025-02-25,70,338!2025-02-20,65,330!2025-02-16,61,310!2025-03-03,76,330!2025-02-27,72,330!2025-02-19,64,310!2025-08-18,184,318-->

Directed acyclic graphs are also called {@{__acyclic directed graphs__<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> or __acyclic digraphs__}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-20,65,330-->

## definitions

A [graph](graph%20(discrete%20mathematics).md) is formed by {@{[vertices](vertex%20(graph%20theory).md) and by [edges](glossary%20of%20graph%20theory.md#edge) connecting pairs of vertices}@}, where {@{the vertices can be any kind of object that is connected in pairs by edges}@}. In {@{the case of a [directed graph](directed%20graph.md)}@}, {@{each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex}@}. {@{A [path](path%20(graph%20theory).md) in a directed graph}@} is {@{a sequence of edges having the property that the ending vertex of each edge in the sequence is the same as the starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence}@}; a path forms {@{a cycle if the starting vertex of its first edge equals the ending vertex of its last edge}@}. A directed acyclic graph is {@{a directed graph that has no cycles}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-12,84,347!2025-10-25,252,330!2025-03-11,84,347!2025-03-12,85,350!2025-02-28,73,350!2025-06-26,158,318!2025-09-14,221,347!2025-02-26,71,350-->

{@{A vertex _v_ of a directed graph}@} is {@{said to be [reachable](reachability.md) from another vertex _u_ when there exists a path that starts at _u_ and ends at _v_}@}. As {@{a special case}@}, {@{every vertex is considered to be reachable from itself \(by a path with zero edges\)}@}. If {@{a vertex can reach itself via a nontrivial path \(a path with one or more edges\)}@}, then {@{that path is a cycle}@}, so another way to define directed acyclic graphs is that {@{they are the graphs in which no vertex can reach itself via a nontrivial path}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-11,84,350!2025-03-09,81,338!2025-03-06,79,350!2025-10-29,258,350!2025-03-10,82,338!2025-11-18,276,330!2025-02-27,72,338-->

{@{The [reachability relation](reachability.md) of a DAG}@} can be formalized as {@{a [partial order](partially%20ordered%20set.md#partial%20order) ≤ on the vertices of the DAG}@}. In {@{this partial order}@}, {@{two vertices _u_ and _v_ are ordered as _u_ ≤ _v_ exactly when there exists a directed path from _u_ to _v_ in the DAG}@}; that is, when {@{_u_ can reach _v_ \(or _v_ is reachable from _u_\)}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> However, {@{different DAGs may give rise to the same reachability relation and the same partial order}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> For example, {@{a DAG with two edges _u_ → _v_ and _v_ → _w_}@} has the same reachability relation as {@{the DAG with three edges _u_ → _v_, _v_ → _w_, and _u_ → _w_}@}. Both of these DAGs {@{produce the same partial order}@}, in which {@{the vertices are ordered as _u_ ≤ _v_ ≤ _w_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-12,85,350!2025-11-02,262,350!2025-03-10,83,350!2025-03-09,82,338!2025-03-10,83,350!2025-10-16,248,330!2025-10-07,241,350!2025-03-07,80,350!2025-03-13,85,350!2025-03-10,82,338-->

{@{The [transitive closure](transitive%20closure.md) of a DAG}@} is {@{the graph with the most edges that has the same reachability relation as the DAG}@}. It has {@{an edge _u_ → _v_ for every pair of vertices \(_u_, _v_\) in the reachability relation ≤ of the DAG}@}, and may therefore be {@{thought of as a direct translation of the reachability relation ≤ into graph-theoretic terms}@}. The same method of {@{translating partial orders into DAGs works more generally}@}: for {@{every finite partially ordered set \(_S_, ≤\)}@}, the graph that has {@{a vertex for every element of _S_ and an edge for every pair of elements in ≤}@} is {@{automatically a transitively closed DAG}@}, and has {@{\(_S_, ≤\) as its reachability relation}@}. In this way, {@{every finite partially ordered set can be represented as a DAG}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-02,75,330!2025-03-07,80,350!2025-03-04,77,350!2025-03-12,85,350!2025-02-16,61,330!2025-03-13,85,350!2025-11-01,261,350!2025-03-12,85,350!2025-10-13,244,338!2025-03-09,82,338-->

{@{The [transitive reduction](transitive%20reduction.md) of a DAG}@} is {@{the graph with the fewest edges that has the same reachability relation as the DAG}@}. It has {@{an edge _u_ → _v_ for every pair of vertices \(_u_, _v_\)}@} in {@{the [covering relation](covering%20relation.md) of the reachability relation ≤ of the DAG}@}. It is {@{a subgraph of the DAG}@}, formed by {@{discarding the edges _u_ → _v_ for which the DAG also contains a longer directed path from _u_ to _v_}@}.

### scheduling

{@{Directed acyclic graph representations of partial orderings}@} have {@{many applications in [scheduling](schedule.md) for systems of tasks with ordering constraints}@}.<sup>[\[29\]](#^ref-29)</sup> An important class of problems of this type concern {@{collections of objects that need to be updated}@}, such as {@{the cells of a [spreadsheet](spreadsheet.md)}@} after one of the cells has been changed, or {@{the [object files](object%20file.md) of a piece of computer software}@} after its [source code](source%20code.md) has been changed. In this context, {@{a [dependency graph](dependency%20graph.md)}@} is {@{a graph that has a vertex for each object to be updated, and an edge connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other}@}. {@{A cycle in this graph}@} is {@{called a [circular dependency](circular%20dependency.md), and is generally not allowed}@}, because {@{there would be no way to consistently schedule the tasks involved in the cycle}@}. {@{Dependency graphs without circular dependencies}@} {@{form DAGs}@}.<sup>[\[30\]](#^ref-30)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-08,267,330!2025-02-25,70,350!2025-03-09,82,338!2025-03-05,78,350!2025-03-13,85,350!2025-03-07,80,350!2025-07-28,179,310!2025-02-25,70,338!2025-03-12,85,350!2025-03-03,76,347!2025-02-20,65,330!2025-03-05,78,350-->

### causal structures

- see: [Bayesian network](Bayesian%20network.md)

Graphs in which {@{vertices represent events occurring at a definite time, and where the edges always point from the early time vertex to a late time vertex of the edge}@}, are {@{necessarily directed and acyclic}@}. {@{The lack of a cycle follows}@} because {@{the time associated with a vertex always increases as you follow any [path](path%20(graph%20theory).md) in the graph}@} so {@{you can never return to a vertex on a path}@}. This reflects {@{our natural intuition that causality means events can only affect the future, they never affect the past}@}, and thus {@{we have no [causal loops](temporal%20paradox.md#causal%20loop)}@}. {@{An example of this type of directed acyclic graph}@} are those {@{encountered in the [causal set approach to quantum gravity](causal%20sets.md)}@} though in this case {@{the graphs considered are [transitively complete](#transitive%20closure%20and%20transitive%20reduction)}@}. In {@{the version history example below}@}, {@{each version of the software}@} is {@{associated with a unique time, typically the time the version was saved, committed or released}@}. In {@{the citation graph examples below}@}, the documents are {@{published at one time and can only refer to older documents}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-20,117,290!2025-03-11,84,350!2025-02-27,72,350!2025-08-23,202,330!2025-03-01,74,338!2025-03-06,79,350!2025-03-05,78,338!2025-02-18,63,310!2025-03-07,80,350!2025-02-22,67,330!2025-11-16,274,330!2025-03-12,85,350!2025-08-18,191,330!2025-03-10,83,350!2025-03-05,78,338-->

Sometimes {@{events are not associated with a specific physical time}@}. Provided that {@{pairs of events have a purely causal relationship}@}, that is {@{edges represent [causal relations](causality.md) between the events}@}, we will {@{have a directed acyclic graph}@}.<sup>[\[38\]](#^ref-38)</sup> For instance, {@{a [Bayesian network](Bayesian%20network.md)}@} represents {@{a system of probabilistic events as vertices in a directed acyclic graph}@}, in which {@{the likelihood of an event may be calculated from the likelihoods of its predecessors in the DAG}@}.<sup>[\[39\]](#^ref-39)</sup> In this context, {@{the [moral graph](moral%20graph.md) of a DAG}@} is {@{the undirected graph created by adding an \(undirected\) edge between all parents of the same vertex \(sometimes called _marrying_\)}@}, and then {@{replacing all directed edges by undirected edges}@}.<sup>[\[40\]](#^ref-40)</sup> Another type of graph with a similar causal structure is {@{an [influence diagram](influence%20diagram.md)}@}, the vertices of which {@{represent either decisions to be made or unknown information, and the edges of which represent causal influences from one vertex to another}@}.<sup>[\[41\]](#^ref-41)</sup> In {@{[epidemiology](epidemiology.md)}@}, for instance, these diagrams are {@{often used to estimate the expected value of different choices for intervention}@}.<sup>[\[42\]](#^ref-42)</sup><sup>[\[43\]](#^ref-43)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-09-30,235,350!2025-03-02,75,338!2025-03-07,80,350!2025-02-21,66,310!2025-02-17,61,330!2025-02-26,71,350!2025-02-25,70,338!2025-03-09,82,338!2025-08-18,185,318!2025-02-27,72,350!2025-03-07,80,350!2025-10-30,259,350!2025-03-08,81,338!2025-02-26,71,330-->

{@{The converse is also true}@}. That is {@{in any application represented by a directed acyclic graph there is a causal structure}@}, either {@{an explicit order or time in the example or an order which can be derived from graph structure}@}.

For instance {@{[transitive reduction](#transitive%20closure%20and%20transitive%20reduction)}@} gives {@{new insights into the citation distributions found in different applications}@} highlighting {@{clear differences in the mechanisms creating citations networks in different contexts}@}.<sup>[\[51\]](#^ref-51)</sup> Another technique is {@{[main path analysis](main%20path%20analysis.md)}@}, which {@{traces the citation links and suggests the most significant citation chains in a given [citation graph](citation%20graph.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,274,330!2025-03-13,85,350!2025-02-17,62,310!2025-05-18,115,290!2025-07-24,168,330!2025-03-07,80,347!2025-03-04,77,350!2025-10-16,252,350!2025-03-12,85,350!2025-03-11,84,350!2025-10-29,257,338!2025-03-09,82,338!2025-03-11,84,350!2025-10-24,256,350!2025-11-06,265,330!2025-07-07,153,318!2025-03-06,79,350!2025-03-13,85,350!2025-03-12,84,350!2025-03-12,85,350-->

{@{The [Price model](Price's%20model.md)}@} is {@{too simple to be a realistic model of a [citation network](citation%20graph.md)}@} but {@{it is simple enough to allow for analytic solutions for some of its properties}@}. Many of these can be found by using {@{results derived from the undirected version of the [Price model](Price's%20model.md), the [Barabási–Albert model](Barabási–Albert%20model.md)}@}. However, since {@{[Price's model](Price's%20model.md) gives a directed acyclic graph}@}, it is {@{a useful model when looking for analytic calculations of properties unique to directed acyclic graphs}@}. For instance, {@{the length of the longest path}@}, from {@{the n-th node added to the network to the first node in the network}@}, scales {@{as<sup>[\[52\]](#^ref-52)</sup> $\ln(n)$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-14,247,330!2025-03-09,81,338!2025-02-28,73,350!2025-10-03,240,338!2025-10-31,260,350!2025-02-16,60,330!2025-02-19,64,310!2025-10-20,256,350!2025-07-16,172,310-->

### data compression

{@{Directed acyclic graphs}@} may also be {@{used as a [compact representation](data%20compression.md) of a collection of sequences}@}. In this type of application, {@{one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences}@}. When {@{many of the sequences share the same subsequences}@}, {@{these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG}@}, allowing {@{the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately}@}. For example, {@{the [directed acyclic word graph](deterministic%20acyclic%20finite%20state%20automaton.md)}@} is {@{a [data structure](data%20structure.md) in computer science}@} formed by {@{a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols}@}; {@{the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph}@} represent {@{a set of [strings](string%20(computer%20science).md), such as English words}@}.<sup>[\[53\]](#^ref-53)</sup> {@{Any set of sequences}@} can be {@{represented as paths in a tree}@}, by {@{forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence}@} and {@{making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element}@}; {@{the tree formed in this way for a set of strings}@} is {@{called a [trie](trie.md)}@}. {@{A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie}@} by {@{allowing paths to diverge and rejoin}@}, so that {@{a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex}@}.<sup>[\[54\]](#^ref-54)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-11,83,347!2025-08-13,194,330!2025-03-05,78,350!2025-03-10,83,350!2025-09-14,221,347!2025-10-18,250,350!2025-03-04,77,338!2025-08-02,188,310!2025-02-22,67,330!2025-09-28,233,330!2025-02-25,70,338!2025-02-20,65,330!2025-02-17,61,330!2025-03-07,80,350!2025-07-07,164,310!2025-03-12,85,350!2025-03-06,79,350!2025-03-10,83,350!2025-03-09,81,338!2025-10-28,257,330-->

{@{The same idea of using a DAG to represent a family of paths}@} occurs in {@{the [binary decision diagram](binary%20decision%20diagram.md)}@},<sup>[\[55\]](#^ref-55)</sup><sup>[\[56\]](#^ref-56)</sup> {@{a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions}@}. In {@{a binary decision diagram}@}, each non-sink vertex is {@{labeled by the name of a binary variable, and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1}@}. {@{The function value for any [truth assignment](interpretation%20(logic).md) to the variables}@} is {@{the value at the sink found by following a path, starting from the single source vertex}@}, that {@{at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex's variable}@}. Just as {@{directed acyclic word graphs can be viewed as a compressed form of tries}@}, {@{binary decision diagrams can be viewed as compressed forms of [decision trees](decision%20tree.md)}@} that {@{save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions}@}.<sup>[\[57\]](#^ref-57)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-21,66,330!2025-11-03,263,350!2025-03-09,82,347!2025-07-17,173,310!2025-10-11,242,338!2025-02-28,73,350!2025-03-06,79,350!2025-02-17,62,310!2025-08-22,190,330!2025-03-01,74,330!2025-10-14,245,338-->
