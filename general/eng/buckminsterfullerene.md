# buckministerfullerene

__Buckministerfullerene__ is {@{a [fullerene](fullerene.md) with the [chemical formula](chemical%20formula.md) __C<sub>60</sub>__}@}. It has a structure of {@{[truncated icosahedron](truncated%20icosahedron.md) with 20 [hexagons](hexagon.md) and 12 [pentagons](pentagon.md)}@}.

## properties

It is {@{relatively [hard](hardness.md) and [strong](strength%20of%20materials.md)}@} compared to other [molecular solids](molecular%20solid.md). Its [melting point](melting%20point.md) is {@{1070 °C, which is lower than [graphite](graphite.md) (3730 °C) and [diamond](diamond.md) (3550 °C)}@}. It is [soluble](solubility.md) in {@{[aromatic](aromaticity.md) [solvents](solvent.md) but not [water](water.md)}@}. It is {@{an n-type [semiconductor](semiconductor.md) that when [doped](doping%20(semiconductor).md) by [alkali metals](alkali%20metal.md), becomes a [conductor](electrical%20conductor.md) or even a [superconductor](superconductivity.md)}@}.
