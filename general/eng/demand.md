In [economics](economics.md), __demand__ is {@{the quantity of a [good](goods.md) that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given time}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> In economics {@{"demand" for a commodity is not the same thing as "desire" for it}@}. It refers to {@{both the desire to purchase and the ability to pay for a commodity}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-12-25,1465,364!2029-10-18,1411,364!2029-10-13,1408,364-->

Demand is always expressed {@{in relation to a particular price and a particular time period}@} since {@{demand is a flow concept}@}. Flow is {@{any variable which is expressed per unit of time}@}. Demand thus {@{does not refer to a single isolated purchase, but a continuous flow of purchases}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2030-02-23,1502,364!2029-12-13,1453,364!2028-11-26,1143,350!2030-02-06,1485,364-->

## factors influencing demand

{@{The factors that influence the decisions of household \(individual consumers\) to purchase a commodity}@} are known as {@{the determinants of demand}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> Some important determinants of demand are: <!--SR:!2030-02-13,1492,364!2030-04-25,1561,364-->

__The price of the commodity__: {@{Most important determinant of the demand for a commodity}@} is {@{the price of the commodity itself}@}. Normally {@{there is an inverse relationship between the price of the commodity and its quantity demanded}@}. It implies that {@{the lower the price of the commodity, the larger is the quantity demanded}@} and {@{the higher the price, the lesser is the quantity demanded}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> This negative relationship is {@{embodied in the downward slope of the consumer demand curve}@}. {@{The assumption of an inverse relationship between price and demand}@} is {@{both reasonable and intuitive}@}. For instance, if {@{the price of a gallon of milk were to increase from \$5 to \$15}@}, this significant price rise would {@{render the commodity unaffordable for some consumers, thereby leading to a decrease in demand}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-25,1068,350!2028-09-10,1082,350!2027-05-29,699,330!2028-02-13,909,344!2030-06-20,1600,364!2030-03-17,1524,364!2030-03-21,1528,364!2030-06-24,1604,364!2029-10-25,1417,364!2030-02-22,1501,364-->

{@{__Price of related goods__}@}: {@{The principal related goods}@} are {@{complements and substitutes}@}. A complement is {@{a good that is used with the primary good}@}. Examples include {@{hotdogs and mustard, beer and pretzels, automobiles and gasoline}@}. \({@{Perfect complements}@} behave {@{as a single good}@}.\) If {@{the price of the complement goes up}@}, {@{the quantity demanded of the other good goes down}@}. <!--SR:!2030-05-16,1576,364!2029-10-22,1416,364!2030-07-05,1615,364!2030-03-13,1520,364!2027-03-24,638,324!2030-06-09,1589,364!2030-06-22,1602,364!2029-09-30,1397,364!2030-03-19,1526,364-->

Mathematically, {@{the variable representing the price of the complementary good}@} would have {@{a negative coefficient in the demand function}@}. For example, {@{Q<sub>d</sub> = a - P - P<sub>g</sub>}@} where {@{Q is the quantity of automobiles demanded, P is the price of automobiles and P<sub>g</sub> is the price of gasoline}@}. The other main category of related goods are {@{substitutes}@}. Substitutes are {@{goods that can be used in place of the primary good}@}. {@{The mathematical relationship between the price of the substitute and the demand for the good in question}@} is {@{positive}@}. If {@{the price of the substitute goes down the demand for the good in question goes down}@}. <!--SR:!2030-06-19,1599,364!2030-01-27,1475,364!2029-11-06,1427,364!2030-04-26,1562,364!2029-10-14,1409,364!2029-12-04,1447,364!2027-12-05,798,330!2030-05-22,1580,364!2030-07-11,1621,364-->

{@{__Income of the Consumer__}@}: Income of the consumer is {@{the basic determinant of the quantity demanded of a product}@} as it {@{determines the purchasing power of the consumer}@}. Generally, there is {@{a direct relationship between the income of the consumer and his demand for a product}@}, i.e., {@{with an increase in income, the demand for the commodity increases}@}. However, {@{this may not always be the case}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2030-06-10,1590,364!2030-03-03,1510,364!2030-01-29,1477,364!2030-02-09,1488,364!2030-01-17,1465,364!2030-01-20,1468,364-->

{@{__Consumers' Tastes or Preferences__}@}: {@{The greater the desire to own a good}@} the more likely {@{one is to buy the good}@}. There is {@{a basic distinction between desire and demand}@}. {@{Tastes and preferences}@} depend on {@{social customs, habits of the people, fashion, general lifestyle of the people, advertisement, new inventions, etc.}@} Some of these factors like fashion {@{keep on changing, leading to change in consumers' tastes and preferences}@}. As a result, {@{the demand for different goods changes}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2030-07-07,1617,364!2029-11-02,1424,364!2029-11-11,1431,364!2029-10-01,1398,364!2029-10-25,1417,364!2030-06-23,1603,364!2029-10-30,1422,364!2030-04-05,1543,364-->

{@{__Consumers' Expectations__}@}: {@{Consumers' expectations regarding factors}@} such as {@{future prices, income, and availability of goods}@} play a crucial role in {@{determining the demand for goods and services in the present period}@}. For instance, if {@{consumers anticipate a future increase in the price of a commodity}@}, they are {@{likely to demand a greater quantity of that commodity now to avoid paying a higher price later}@}. Similarly, if {@{people expect an increase in their income}@}, they will {@{buy more commodities in anticipation of a rise in their income}@}. In the same way if {@{consumers expect scarcity of certain goods in future}@} on account of {@{their expectation that its production may fall in future}@} due to {@{strike, crop failure, etc.}@}, {@{the current demand for such goods would increase}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2030-01-21,1469,364!2027-11-05,835,344!2028-09-21,1068,344!2029-11-07,1428,364!2029-11-12,1432,364!2030-04-29,1563,364!2030-02-12,1491,364!2030-02-28,1507,364!2029-10-28,1420,364!2029-10-15,1408,364!2030-02-25,1504,364!2030-03-02,1509,364-->

{@{__Consumer-Credit Facilities__}@}: If {@{consumers are able to get credit facilities or they are able to borrow from the banks}@}, they would be {@{tempted to purchase certain good they could not have purchased otherwise}@}. For instance, {@{the demand for cars in [India](india.md) has increased partly}@} because {@{people are able to get loans from the banks to purchase cars}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2030-04-15,1551,364!2030-06-30,1610,364!2029-10-09,1404,364!2030-03-14,1521,364!2029-11-09,1429,364-->

{@{__Demonstration Effect__}@}: Demonstration effect refers to {@{the tendency of a person to emulate the consumption style of other persons}@} such as {@{their friends, neighbours, etc.}@} For instance, {@{the demand for luxury cars and expensive mobile sets has increased in recent years}@} partly because of {@{the desire of the people to follow the consumption style of others}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2030-02-17,1496,364!2029-10-17,1410,364!2028-07-18,1037,350!2030-03-09,1516,364!2028-06-15,992,344-->

{@{__Distribution of Income__}@}: {@{Distribution of income in the country}@} also affects the demand for goods. If {@{the distribution of income in a country is unequal}@}, there will be {@{more demand for luxury goods like cars and LED televisions}@}. On the other hand, if {@{the income is evenly distributed}@}, there will be {@{less demand for luxury goods and more demand for essential goods \(necessities\)}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2030-02-16,1495,364!2030-06-13,1593,364!2028-05-19,971,344!2029-10-11,1406,364!2030-01-19,1467,364!2029-11-14,1434,364-->

{@{__Size and Composition of population__}@}: Market demand for a commodity depends on {@{the size and composition of the population}@}. {@{The population size of a country}@} determines {@{the number of consumers}@}. The {@{larger the population, the larger is likely to be the number of consumers}@}. {@{An increase in the size of population}@} will {@{increase the demand for a commodity by increasing the number of consumers and, vice versa}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-02-28,924,344!2029-10-10,1405,364!2029-10-23,1417,364!2029-10-20,1413,364!2029-12-16,1456,364!2030-04-08,1546,364!2026-03-03,368,362-->

{@{__Climatic factors__}@}: Demand for different goods depends on {@{the climatic factors because different goods are needed for different climates}@}. For instance, {@{the demand for ice, fans, air conditioners, cold drinks, cotton clothes, etc increases in summer}@}. Likewise, in {@{winter, the demand for heaters, blowers, hot drinks, woollen cloths, etc increases}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2030-02-13,1492,364!2029-11-01,1423,364!2028-07-08,1011,344!2029-12-01,1445,364-->

{@{__Government Policy__}@}: {@{Economic policy of the government}@} also influences the demand for commodities. If {@{the government imposes taxes on various commodities in the form}@} of {@{VAT, excise duties, etc.}@}, {@{the prices of these commodities will increase}@}, As a result, {@{demand for these commodities will fall}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2030-01-29,1477,364!2030-05-15,1575,364!2030-01-26,1474,364!2030-03-04,1511,364!2029-10-26,1418,364!2030-03-12,1519,364-->

## demand function equation

A demand function states {@{the relationship between the demand for a product and its various determinants}@}. It is a shorthand way of {@{saying that quantity demanded depends on various determinants}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> It gives {@{functional relationship \(i.e., cause and effect relationship\)}@} between {@{the demand for a commodity and various factors affecting demand}@}. {@{The algebraic expression of the demand function}@} is given in the form of the following equation: {@{__D<sub>n</sub> = f \(P<sub>n</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>...P<sub>n-1</sub>, Y, T, E, H, G...\)__}@} where {@{'D<sub>n</sub>' denotes the demand for a particular commodity 'n', 'f' shows the functional relation between the demand for the commodity 'n' and the factors affecting its demand}@}, {@{'P<sub>n</sub>' is the price of commodity 'n', 'P<sub>1</sub>... P<sub>n-1</sub>' indicates the price of all other commodities}@}, {@{'Y' is the income, 'T' stands for the taste, 'E' stands for expectations, 'H' is the size of population, 'G' stands for government's policy}@}. In this demand function, {@{D<sub>n</sub> is treated as dependent variable}@}, and {@{all the factors on the right-hand side are treated as independent variables}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2030-05-27,1585,364!2030-04-07,1545,364!2030-07-12,1622,364!2030-01-20,1468,364!2030-04-15,1553,364!2027-02-16,613,324!2030-02-20,1499,364!2026-08-18,482,324!2030-01-13,1461,364!2028-09-28,1073,344-->

## demand curve

- see: [demand curve](demand%20curve.md)

Demand curve is {@{a graphical presentation of the "[law of demand](law%20of%20demand.md)"}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> The curve shows {@{how the price of a commodity or service changes as the quantity demanded increases}@}. Every point on the curve is {@{an amount of consumer demand and the corresponding market price}@}. The graph shows {@{the law of demand, which states that people will buy less of something if the price goes up and vice versa}@}. According to {@{Kotler, eight demand states are possible}@}: <!--SR:!2029-10-16,1411,364!2029-11-03,1425,364!2028-07-25,1043,350!2029-10-11,1406,364!2029-10-20,1414,364-->

1. Negative demand — ::@:: Consumers dislike the product and may even pay to avoid it. <!--SR:!2030-01-24,1472,364!2027-08-24,703,324-->
2. Nonexistent demand — ::@:: Consumers may be unaware of or uninterested in the product. <!--SR:!2030-04-04,1542,364!2030-06-18,1598,364-->
3. Latent demand — ::@:: Consumers may share a strong need that cannot be satisfied by an existing product. <!--SR:!2028-12-06,1150,350!2030-02-02,1481,364-->
4. Declining demand — ::@:: Consumers begin to buy the product less frequently or not at all. <!--SR:!2029-10-12,1408,364!2030-07-03,1613,364-->
5. Irregular demand — ::@:: Consumer purchases vary on a seasonal, monthly, weekly, daily, or even hourly basis. <!--SR:!2028-02-01,904,344!2030-04-16,1554,364-->
6. Full demand — ::@:: Consumers are adequately buying all products put into the marketplace. <!--SR:!2030-05-21,1579,364!2030-02-04,1483,364-->
7. Overfull demand — ::@:: More consumers would like to buy the product than can be satisfied. <!--SR:!2030-01-09,1457,364!2029-10-03,1399,364-->
8. Unwholesome demand — ::@:: Consumers may be attracted to products that have undesirable social consequences.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-03-23,939,344!2028-10-12,1106,350-->

## price elasticity of demand

- see: [price elasticity of demand](price%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md)

{@{The price elasticity of demand}@} is {@{a measure of the sensitivity of the quantity variable, Q, to changes in the price variable, P}@}. It shows {@{the percent by which the quantity demanded will change as a result of a given percentage change in the price}@}. Thus, {@{a demand elasticity of -2}@} says that {@{the quantity demanded will fall 2% if the price rises 1%}@}. For {@{infinitesimal changes, the elasticity is \(∂Q/∂P\)×\(P/Q\)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-11-10,1431,364!2030-06-25,1605,364!2029-10-17,1412,364!2029-10-16,1409,364!2029-09-27,1394,364!2028-09-10,1058,344-->

### elasticity along linear demand curve

{@{The slope of a linear demand curve}@} is {@{constant}@}. {@{The elasticity of demand}@} {@{changes continuously as one moves down the demand curve}@} because {@{the ratio of price to quantity continuously falls}@}. At {@{the point the demand curve intersects the y-axis}@}, demand becomes {@{infinitely elastic, because the variable _Q_ appearing in the denominator of the elasticity formula is zero}@}. At {@{the point the demand curve intersects the x-axis}@}, the elasticity is {@{zero, because the variable _P_ appearing in the numerator of the elasticity formula is zero}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> At {@{one point on a linear demand curve}@}, demand is {@{unitary elastic: an elasticity of one}@}. For {@{higher prices, the elasticity is greater than 1 in magnitude}@}: demand is {@{said to be elastic because percentage quantity changes are bigger than price changes}@}. For {@{prices below the point of unit elasticity}@}, the elasticity is {@{less than 1 and demand is said to be inelastic}@}. <!--SR:!2030-03-01,1508,364!2027-04-06,448,324!2029-11-08,1429,364!2028-08-12,1037,344!2030-01-24,1472,364!2029-10-10,1406,364!2026-08-17,431,304!2028-10-22,1115,350!2030-04-22,1558,364!2026-11-26,541,310!2029-10-06,1403,364!2029-12-12,1453,364!2029-12-11,1452,364!2026-02-17,128,401!2026-02-17,128,401-->

### constant price elasticity demand

{@{Constant elasticity of demand}@} occurs {@{when $Q=aP^{c}$}@} where {@{_a_ and _c_ are parameters}@}, and {@{the constant price elasticity is $c\leq 0$}@}. <!--SR:!2030-06-21,1601,364!2029-09-26,1393,364!2026-06-03,141,407!2026-05-23,130,407-->

### perfectly inelastic demand

{@{Perfectly inelastic demand}@} is represented by {@{a vertical demand curve}@}. Under perfect price inelasticity of demand, {@{the price has no effect on the quantity demanded}@}. The demand for the good {@{remains the same regardless of how low or high the price}@}. {@{Goods with \(nearly\) perfectly inelastic demand}@} are {@{typically goods with no substitutes}@}. For instance, {@{insulin is nearly perfectly inelastic}@}. Diabetics need {@{insulin to survive so a change in price would not effect the quantity demanded}@}. Insulin is {@{not perfectly inelastic, however}@}, as {@{a prohibitively high price}@} would cause {@{some individuals to be incapable of purchasing insulin entirely}@}. On the other hand, if {@{insulin was sold at a very low price}@}, it is possible that {@{some individuals would purchase more insulin}@} if they were {@{not able to afford it before}@}. Because of {@{the effects of extreme pricing}@}, {@{no good}@} can be {@{considered truly perfectly inelastic}@}. <!--SR:!2030-06-28,1608,364!2030-04-20,1556,364!2030-01-22,1470,364!2030-01-31,1479,364!2029-10-13,1406,364!2029-03-07,1141,344!2029-12-17,1457,364!2029-11-16,1436,364!2029-10-23,1417,364!2028-09-04,1077,350!2029-11-15,1435,364!2029-10-07,1403,364!2030-06-18,1598,364!2029-09-27,1394,364!2026-05-28,135,407!2026-05-28,135,407!2026-06-03,141,407-->

## market structure and the demand curve

In {@{perfectly competitive markets}@} {@{the demand curve, the average revenue curve, and the marginal revenue curve}@} all {@{coincide and are horizontal at the market-given price (in the long run)}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> {@{The demand curve}@} is {@{perfectly elastic}@} and coincides with {@{the average and marginal revenue curves}@}. Economic actors are {@{price-takers}@}. Perfectly competitive firms have {@{zero market power; that is, they have no ability to affect the terms and conditions of exchange}@}. A perfectly competitive firm's decisions are {@{limited to whether to produce and if so, how much}@}. In {@{less than perfectly competitive markets}@} the demand curve is {@{negatively sloped and there is a separate marginal revenue curve}@}. A firm in {@{a less than perfectly competitive market is a price-setter}@}. The firm can decide {@{how much to produce or what price to charge}@}. In deciding one variable {@{the firm is necessarily determining the other variable}@}. <!--SR:!2030-01-28,1476,364!2030-02-27,1506,364!2030-01-18,1466,364!2028-09-10,1011,344!2030-07-10,1620,364!2029-11-16,1436,364!2030-05-10,1570,364!2028-12-03,1149,350!2030-06-15,1595,364!2028-08-05,1052,350!2030-03-31,1538,364!2029-09-26,1393,364!2026-06-02,140,407!2026-05-27,134,407-->

## inverse demand function

- see: [inverse demand function](inverse%20demand%20function.md)

In {@{its standard form}@} a linear demand equation is {@{Q = a - bP}@}. That is, {@{quantity demanded is a function of price}@}. {@{The inverse demand equation, or price equation}@}, treats {@{price as a function f of quantity demanded: P = f\(Q\)}@}. To {@{compute the inverse demand equation}@}, simply {@{solve for P from the demand equation}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> For example, if {@{the demand equation is Q = 240 - 2P}@} then {@{the inverse demand equation would be P = 120 - .5Q}@}, the right side of which is {@{the inverse demand function}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> <!--SR:!2030-05-17,1577,364!2029-10-05,1401,364!2030-07-09,1619,364!2029-10-21,1414,364!2030-02-24,1503,364!2030-03-28,1535,364!2027-06-04,660,324!2030-02-12,1491,364!2028-08-03,1050,350!2029-11-05,1426,364-->

The inverse demand function is useful in {@{deriving the total and marginal revenue functions}@}. {@{Total revenue}@} equals {@{price, P, times quantity, Q, or TR = P×Q}@}. Multiply {@{the inverse demand function by Q to derive the total revenue function}@}: {@{TR = \(120 - .5Q\) × Q = 120Q - 0.5Q²}@}. {@{The marginal revenue function}@} is {@{the first derivative of the total revenue function}@}; here {@{MR = 120 - Q}@}. Note that the MR function has {@{the same y-intercept as the inverse demand function in this linear example}@}; the x-intercept of the MR function is {@{one-half the value of that of the demand function}@}, and the slope of the MR function is {@{twice that of the inverse demand function}@}. This relationship holds {@{true for all linear demand equations}@}. The importance of being able to quickly calculate MR is that {@{the profit-maximizing condition for firms regardless of market structure is to produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost \(MC\)}@}. To derive MC {@{the first derivative of the total cost function is taken}@}. For example, assume cost, C, equals {@{420 + 60Q + Q<sup>2</sup>}@}. Then {@{MC = 60 + 2Q}@}. Equating MR to MC and solving for Q gives {@{Q = 20}@}. So {@{20 is the profit maximizing quantity}@}: to {@{find the profit-maximizing price}@} simply {@{plug the value of Q into the inverse demand equation and solve for P}@}. <!--SR:!2029-11-05,1427,364!2029-10-08,1403,364!2028-04-11,944,344!2029-10-19,1412,364!2028-02-04,906,344!2029-09-28,1395,364!2030-06-19,1599,364!2029-09-29,1396,364!2030-06-27,1607,364!2030-06-23,1603,364!2030-02-15,1494,364!2030-06-29,1609,364!2027-06-21,716,330!2028-02-12,910,344!2029-10-26,1418,364!2030-07-13,1623,364!2030-02-26,1505,364!2030-02-03,1482,364!2029-10-29,1421,364!2030-05-11,1571,364-->

## residual demand curve

{@{The demand curve facing a particular firm}@} is called {@{the residual demand curve}@}. The residual demand curve is {@{the market demand that is not met by other firms in the industry at a given price}@}. The residual demand curve is {@{the market demand curve D\(p\), minus the [supply](supply%20(economics).md) of other organizations, So\(p\)}@}: {@{Dr\(p\) = D\(p\) - So\(p\)}@}<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> <!--SR:!2030-02-18,1497,364!2029-11-13,1433,364!2030-03-27,1534,364!2030-02-08,1487,364!2029-10-19,1413,364-->

## demand function and total revenue

If {@{the demand curve is linear}@}, then {@{it has the form: Qd = a - b\*p}@}, where {@{p is the price of the good and q is the quantity demanded}@}. {@{The intercept of the curve and the vertical axis}@} is {@{represented by a, meaning the price when no quantity demanded}@}. and b is {@{the slope of the demand function}@}. If {@{the demand function has the form like that}@}, then the total revenue should {@{equal quantity demanded times the price of the good}@}, which can be represented by: {@{TR= q\*p = q\(a-bq\)}@}. <!--SR:!2030-05-04,1567,364!2030-01-30,1478,364!2030-03-24,1531,364!2029-11-07,1428,364!2029-10-12,1407,364!2030-05-26,1584,364!2030-06-14,1594,364!2030-04-28,1562,364!2030-02-11,1490,364-->

## Is the demand curve for PC firm really flat?

{@{Practically every introductory microeconomics text}@} describes {@{the demand curve facing a perfectly competitive firm as being flat or horizontal}@}. A horizontal demand curve is {@{perfectly elastic}@}. If {@{there are n identical firms in the market}@} then the elasticity of demand PED facing any one firm is {@{PED<sub>mi</sub> = nPED<sub>m</sub> - \(n - 1\) PES}@} where {@{PED<sub>m</sub> is the market elasticity of demand, PES is the elasticity of supply of the market<!-- each of the other firms -->, and \(n -1\) is the number of other firms}@}. (annotation: This formula is more easily understandably by making it into the following form: {@{$$\text{PED}_{\text{mi} } = n \left( \text{PED}_{\text m} - \frac {n - 1} n \text{PES} \right) \,.$$}@} The above says {@{the market demand elasticity subtracted by the market supply elasticity of all other firms excluding the firm we are considering is the market _residual demand_ elasticity}@}. Finally, {@{multiply the market _residual demand_ elasticity by _n_ to get the demand curve for the firm}@} because {@{a firm supplies 1/_n_ of the supplied quantity in the market}@}.) This formula {@{suggests two things}@}. The demand curve is {@{not perfectly elastic}@} and if {@{there are a large number of firms in the industry}@} {@{the elasticity of demand for any individual firm will be extremely high and the demand curve facing the firm will be nearly flat}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> <!--SR:!2030-07-04,1614,364!2030-07-03,1613,364!2029-10-31,1422,364!2028-08-10,1056,350!2030-03-02,1509,364!2030-03-05,1512,364!2027-08-13,697,324!2027-01-01,577,324!2028-08-25,1046,344!2028-07-11,1013,344!2029-10-02,1399,364!2030-05-14,1574,364!2028-09-19,1018,344!2030-04-06,1544,364-->

For example, assume that {@{there are 80 firms in the industry}@} and that {@{the demand elasticity for industry is -1.0 and the price elasticity of supply is 3}@}. Then {@{PED<sub>mi</sub> = \(80 x \(-1\)\) - \(79 x 3\) = -80 - 237 = -317}@}. That is {@{the firm PED is 317 times as elastic as the market PED}@}. If a firm raised its price "by one tenth of one percent {@{demand would drop by nearly one third}@}."<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> if {@{the firm raised its price by three tenths of one percent}@} {@{the quantity demanded would drop by nearly 100%}@}. Three tenths of one percent marks {@{the effective range of [pricing power](market%20power.md) the firm has}@} because {@{any attempt to raise prices by a higher percentage will effectively reduce quantity demanded to zero}@}. <!--SR:!2027-11-23,845,344!2028-06-21,947,304!2026-11-06,539,324!2026-05-09,390,304!2028-03-30,933,344!2030-02-02,1481,364!2029-10-27,1419,364!2029-12-06,1448,364!2028-05-18,970,344-->

## demand management in economics

{@{[Demand management in economics](demand%20management.md#demand%20management%20in%20economics)}@} is {@{the art or science of controlling economic or [aggregate demand](aggregate%20demand.md) to avoid a [recession](recession.md)}@}. Such management is inspired by {@{[Keynesian](John%20Maynard%20Keynes.md) [macroeconomics](macroeconomics.md)}@}, and [Keynesian economics](Keynesian%20economics.md) is sometimes referred to as {@{[demand-side economics](demand-side%20economics.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2030-07-06,1616,364!2030-02-07,1486,364!2030-06-25,1605,364!2028-09-23,1069,344-->

Demand management has {@{a defined set of processes, capabilities and recommended behaviors}@} for {@{companies that produce goods and services}@}. {@{Consumer electronics and goods companies}@} often {@{lead in the application of demand management practices to their demand chains}@}; {@{demand management outcomes}@} are {@{a reflection of policies and programs to influence demand}@} as well as {@{competition and options available to users and consumers}@}. Effective demand management follows {@{the concept of a "closed loop"}@} where {@{feedback from the results of the demand plans is fed back into the planning process to improve the predictability of outcomes}@}. Many practices reflect {@{elements of systems dynamics}@}. Volatility is {@{being recognized as significant}@} an issue as the focus on {@{variance of demand to plans and forecasts}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-27,1419,364!2030-02-05,1484,364!2029-12-04,1446,364!2030-06-29,1609,364!2029-11-30,1444,364!2030-02-01,1480,364!2030-04-21,1556,364!2030-03-04,1511,364!2030-02-19,1498,364!2026-02-08,26,391!2026-05-18,104,391!2026-02-08,26,391-->

## different types of goods demand

{@{__Negative demand:__}@} If {@{the market response to a product is negative}@}, it shows that people are {@{not aware of the features of the service and the benefits offered}@}. Under {@{such circumstances}@}, {@{the marketing unit of a service firm}@} has to understand {@{the [psyche](psyche%20(psychology).md) of the potential buyers}@} and find out {@{the prime reason for the rejection of the service}@}. For example: if passengers {@{refuse a bus conductor's call to board the bus}@}, the service firm has to come up with {@{an appropriate strategy to remove the misunderstandings of the potential buyers}@}. A strategy needs to be designed to {@{transform the negative demand into a positive demand}@}. <!--SR:!2030-07-08,1618,364!2029-10-22,1416,364!2030-02-10,1489,364!2028-09-23,1021,344!2030-01-19,1467,364!2030-05-05,1569,364!2030-02-14,1493,364!2026-06-03,141,407!2026-06-03,141,407!2026-06-01,139,407-->

{@{__No demand:__}@} If {@{people are unaware, have insufficient information about a service or due to the consumer's indifference}@} this type of a demand situation could occur. The marketing unit of the firm should focus on {@{promotional campaigns and communicating reasons for potential customers to use the firm's services}@}. {@{Service differentiation}@} is {@{one of the popular strategies used to compete}@} in {@{a no demand situation in the market}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-02,1399,364!2030-04-09,1547,364!2028-06-30,1002,344!2029-10-08,1404,364!2028-10-10,1035,344!2026-02-08,26,391-->

{@{__Latent demand:__}@} At any given time it is {@{impossible to have a set of services}@} that offer {@{total satisfaction to all the needs and wants of society}@}. In the market there exists {@{a gap between desirable and the available}@}. There is always {@{a search on for better and newer offers to fill the gap between desirability and availability}@}. Latent demand is {@{a phenomenon of any economy at any given time}@}, it should be looked upon as {@{a business opportunity by service firms}@} and they should {@{orient themselves to identify and exploit such opportunities at the right time}@}. For example, a passenger traveling in an ordinary bus {@{dreams of traveling in a luxury bus}@}. Therefore, latent demand is {@{nothing but the gap between desirability and availability}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-04,1400,364!2028-10-30,1047,344!2029-11-02,1424,364!2029-10-15,1410,364!2030-02-07,1486,364!2027-12-17,868,344!2029-11-03,1425,364!2028-06-09,988,344!2026-03-24,384,362!2026-02-08,26,391-->

{@{__Seasonal demand:__}@} Some services {@{do not have a year-round demand, and might be required only at a certain period of time}@}. Seasons all over the world are {@{diverse}@}. Seasonal demands create {@{many problems for service organizations}@}, such as {@{idling the capacity, fixed cost and excess expenditure on marketing and promotions}@}. {@{Strategies used by firms to overcome this}@} may include nurturing {@{the service consumption habit of customers so as to make the demand unseasonal}@}, or {@{recognizing markets elsewhere in the world}@} during {@{the off-season period}@}. Hence, this presents {@{an opportunity to target different markets with the appropriate season in different parts of the world}@}. For example, the need for Christmas cards {@{comes around once a year}@}. <!--SR:!2029-11-04,1426,364!2030-06-24,1604,364!2030-07-01,1611,364!2030-01-14,1462,364!2027-03-02,622,324!2029-10-09,1405,364!2029-10-06,1402,364!2029-10-18,1412,364!2030-03-10,1517,364!2026-05-22,129,407!2026-05-23,130,407-->

{@{[Demand patterns](demand%20patterns.md)}@} need to be {@{studied in different segments of the market}@}. Service organizations need to {@{constantly study changing demands related to their service offerings over various time periods}@}. They have to {@{develop a system to chart these demand fluctuations}@}, which helps them in {@{predicting the demand cycles}@}. Demands {@{do fluctuate randomly}@}; therefore, they should be {@{followed on a daily, weekly or monthly basis}@}. <!--SR:!2028-12-12,1155,350!2030-02-21,1500,364!2030-06-08,1588,364!2029-12-02,1446,364!2029-12-05,1448,364!2030-07-01,1611,364!2029-12-16,1457,364-->

## criticism

{@{[E. F. Schumacher](E.%20F.%20Schumacher.md)}@} challenges {@{the prevailing economic assumption that fulfilling demand is the purpose of economic activity}@}, offering {@{a framework of what he calls "[Buddhist economics](Buddhist%20economics.md)"}@} in which {@{wise demands, fulfilling genuine human needs}@}, are {@{distinguished from unwise demands}@}, arising from {@{the [five intellectual impairments](five%20hindrances.md) recognized by Buddhism}@}:<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-03-01,342,304!2030-03-01,1508,364!2030-02-21,1500,364!2029-11-01,1423,364!2028-09-23,1092,350!2026-02-08,26,391-->

> {@{The cultivation and expansion of needs}@} is {@{the antithesis of wisdom}@}. It is also {@{the antithesis of freedom and peace}@}. {@{Every increase of needs}@} tends to {@{increase one's dependence on outside forces over which one cannot have control}@}, and therefore {@{increases existential fear}@}.
