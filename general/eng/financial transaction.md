# financial transaction

A __financial transaction__ is {@{an [agreement](contract.md), or [communication](communication.md), between a buyer and seller to exchange [goods](goods.md), [services](service%20(economics).md), or [assets](asset.md) for payment}@}. Any transaction {@{involves a change in the status of the finances of two or more businesses or individuals}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> A financial transaction {@{always involves one or more financial asset, most commonly [money](money.md) or another valuable item such as [gold](gold.md) or [silver](silver.md)}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2027-10-04,845,330!2026-01-17,365,310!2028-05-17,1036,350-->

There are {@{many types of financial transactions}@}. The most common type, {@{purchases, occur when a good, service, or other commodity is sold to a consumer in exchange for money}@}. Most purchases are {@{made with cash payments, including [physical currency](cash.md), [debit cards](debit%20card.md), or [cheques](cheque.md)}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> The other main form of payment is {@{[credit](credit.md), which gives immediate access to funds in exchange for repayment at a later date}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2027-06-13,755,330!2026-08-11,512,310!2027-06-17,747,310!2026-08-06,504,310-->

## history

- see: [history of money](history%20of%20money.md)

There is no evidence to support the theory that ancient civilizations worked on systems of [barter](barter.md). Instead, most historians believe that ancient cultures worked on principles of [gift economy](gift%20economy.md) and [debt](debt.md).<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> In a gift economy, valuables are given without any formal declaration of repayment, often thought to be a form of [reciprocal altruism](reciprocal%20altruism.md).<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> Official systems of credit and debt were first created around 1800 [BCE](Common%20Era.md) by the [Babylonians](babylonia.md), who established the first formal interest rate limits with the [Code of Hammurabi](Code%20of%20Hammurabi.md).<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup>

Many cultures around the world began using [commodity money](commodity%20money.md)—objects whose value comes from their intrinsic value.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> These often included gold or silver coins, along with non-metal objects such as [cowrie shells](cowrie.md), [beaver pelts](beaver.md), and dried corn.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup><sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> Between 1000 BCE and the first millennium CE, coinage became increasingly common throughout Europe and Asia.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> In England, banknotes were introduced starting in the 17th century. Each note promised to pay the bearer the value in gold upon demand—this is called a [gold standard](gold%20standard.md).<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> In the 20th century, many countries gradually phased out the gold standard in favour of [fiat money](fiat%20money.md)—money that is not backed by any commodity.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup>

Since the start of the 21st century, [online banking](online%20banking.md) has become much more widespread. By 2001, tens of millions of people were doing their banking on the [internet](internet.md).<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> By 2012, between 46 and 82 percent of all transactions were done electronically.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> [Digital currencies](digital%20currency.md), currency that is stored on electronic systems, have gained popularity. [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md), invented in 2009, reached a cap of over [US$](United%20States%20dollar.md)1 trillion in 2021.<sup>[\[16\]](#^ref-16)</sup> One of the downsides of [cryptocurrencies](cryptocurrency.md) is that since they are not tethered to any tangible assets, their price can fluctuate wildly, sometimes by 20% or more in a single day.<sup>[\[17\]](#^ref-17)</sup>

## types of transactions

### cash transactions

A cash transaction is {@{any transaction where money is exchanged for a good, service, or other commodity}@}. Cash transactions can refer to {@{items bought with [physical money](cash.md), such as [coins](coin.md) or cash, or with a [debit card](debit%20card.md)}@}. These differ from {@{credit transactions because the money is immediately taken from the buyer and given to the seller}@}.<sup>[\[18\]](#^ref-18)</sup><sup>[\[19\]](#^ref-19)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-08-26,1401,350!2027-01-09,644,330!2027-06-22,764,330-->

### credit transactions

- see: [credit](credit.md)

Transactions that {@{use credit involve a deferred payment for the goods or services rendered}@}. When {@{something is bought using credit}@}, it {@{gives the seller an asset (the payment at a later date) and gives the buyer a liability (the amount that must be paid at a later date)}@}.<sup>[\[20\]](#^ref-20)</sup> [Credit cards](credit%20card.md) are {@{an example of when credit is used, where the card issuer (usually a bank) gives the customer a [line of credit](line%20of%20credit.md) with which they can make purchases}@}. The liabilities the customer accrues with the card are {@{usually paid off at a set date, and any unpaid liabilities create [interest](interest.md) for the issuer}@}.<sup>[\[21\]](#^ref-21)</sup> <!--SR:!2027-04-21,702,330!2029-03-03,1265,350!2028-04-27,1020,350!2027-12-16,900,330!2028-08-07,1102,350-->

{@{[Loans](loan.md) and [mortgages](mortgage.md)}@} are examples of credit. The lender {@{agrees to give out a lump sum (the "[principal](debt.md#principal)") to the borrower, who pays back the loaned amount over a set period of time (called a "term")}@}. The lender {@{usually charges an additional percentage on top of the initial amount borrowed, called the "[interest rate](interest%20rate.md)"}@}.<sup>[\[22\]](#^ref-22)</sup> Mortgages are {@{similar to loans}@}, but are usually {@{for a larger amount of money and over a longer term, often for buying [real estate](real%20estate.md)}@}.<sup>[\[23\]](#^ref-23)</sup> Mortgages are {@{almost always secured by [collateral](collateral%20(finance).md), most commonly the real estate they are being used to purchase}@}. If {@{the borrower fails to make the necessary payments on the mortgage}@}, the lender {@{has the right to claim and sell the property in a process known as [foreclosure](foreclosure.md)}@}.<sup>[\[24\]](#^ref-24)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-30,313,330!2026-09-24,551,310!2028-10-17,1156,350!2026-01-24,133,270!2028-08-15,1108,350!2028-05-13,1033,350!2026-08-20,516,310!2026-01-11,96,375-->

### internal and external transactions

External transactions are {@{any business transactions that involve more than one party}@}. For example, {@{a company buying [inventory](inventory.md) from a supplier}@} would be considered external. {@{All cash and credit transactions}@} are external, since {@{they affect the finances of more than one person or group}@}.<sup>[\[25\]](#^ref-25)</sup> On the other hand, internal transactions {@{only affect one business}@}. {@{Shifting goods between different [departments](departmentalization.md) in a business}@} is an internal transaction, since it {@{does not change the overall finances of the company}@}.<sup>[\[26\]](#^ref-26)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-06-03,1338,350!2025-11-02,315,330!2029-08-15,1395,350!2026-11-15,601,330!2028-09-15,1132,350!2026-10-17,579,330!2027-08-31,819,330-->
