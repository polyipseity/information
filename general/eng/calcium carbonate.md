# calcium carbonate

__Calcium carbonate__, also known as {@{limestone}@}, is a solid [ionic compound](ionic%20compound.md). Its molecular formula is {@{CaCO<sub>3</sub>}@}. It looks like a {@{white solid}@}.

It is commonly found in {@{the [rocks](rock%20(geology).md) [limestone](limestone.md), [chalk](chalk.md), and [marble](marble.md)}@} as {@{the [minerals](mineral.md) [calcite](calcite.md), [aragonite](aragonite.md), and [dolomite](dolomite%20(mineral).md)}@}.

## reactions

Calcium carbonate {@{[decomposes](thermal%20decomposition.md) under heating}@}.
> {@{CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) $\xrightarrow{\text{heat} }$ CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)}@}

It also {@{reacts with [acids](acid.md)}@}.
> {@{CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2HCl(aq) → CaCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)}@}

### tests

To test for calcium carbonate, both {@{calcium ions and carbonate ions}@} are tested for. The former can be detected by the {@{[flame test](flame%20test.md)}@}, in which a {@{brick red flame}@} can be observed. The latter can be tested by adding {@{[dilute hydrochloric acid](dilute%20hydrochloric%20acid)}@}, in which {@{colorless gas}@} that {@{turns [limewater](calcium%20hydroxide.md) milky}@} is given out.
