# calcium carbonate

__Calcium carbonate__, also known as {@{limestone}@}, is a solid [ionic compound](ionic%20compound.md). Its molecular formula is {@{CaCO<sub>3</sub>}@}. It looks like a {@{white solid}@}. <!--SR:!2033-04-14,2987,339!2030-05-06,2034,317!2026-06-26,1116,298-->

It is commonly found in {@{the [rocks](rock%20(geology).md) [limestone](limestone.md), [chalk](chalk.md), and [marble](marble.md)}@} as {@{the [minerals](mineral.md) [calcite](calcite.md), [aragonite](aragonite.md), and [dolomite](dolomite%20(mineral).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-02-23,1222,300!2027-07-18,943,250-->

## reactions

Calcium carbonate {@{[decomposes](thermal%20decomposition.md) under heating}@}.
> {@{CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) $\xrightarrow{\text{heat} }$ CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)}@} <!--SR:!2027-11-12,1407,270!2028-10-31,1764,310-->

It also {@{reacts with [acids](acid.md)}@}.
> {@{CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2HCl(aq) â†’ CaCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)}@} <!--SR:!2030-08-09,2099,277!2027-09-16,1422,299-->

### tests

To test for calcium carbonate, both {@{calcium ions and carbonate ions}@} are tested for. The former can be detected by the {@{[flame test](flame%20test.md)}@}, in which a {@{brick red flame}@} can be observed. The latter can be tested by adding {@{[dilute hydrochloric acid](dilute%20hydrochloric%20acid)}@}, in which {@{colorless gas}@} that {@{turns [limewater](calcium%20hydroxide.md) milky}@} is given out. <!--SR:!2034-10-08,3332,298!2034-07-05,3260,298!2034-08-22,3300,299!2029-02-23,1267,230!2028-04-15,1293,250!2026-04-22,1065,299-->
