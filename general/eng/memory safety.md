# memory safety

- This article is about protection of memory in software development. For hardware protection of memory, see [memory protection](memory%20protection.md).

__Memory safety__ is {@{the state of being protected from various [software bugs](software%20bug.md) and [security vulnerabilities](vulnerability%20(computer%20security).md) when dealing with [memory](random-access%20memory.md) access}@}, such as {@{[buffer overflows](buffer%20overflow.md) and [dangling pointers](dangling%20pointer.md)}@}. For example, [Java](java%20(programming%20language).md) is said {@{to be memory-safe}@} because {@{its [runtime error detection](runtime%20error%20detection.md) checks array bounds and pointer dereferences}@}. In contrast, [C](c%20(programming%20language).md) and [C++](C++.md) {@{allow arbitrary [pointer arithmetic](pointer%20(computer%20programming).md) with pointers implemented as direct memory addresses with no provision for [bounds checking](bounds%20checking.md)}@}, and thus {@{are potentially __memory-unsafe__}@}. <!--SR:!2027-06-03,763,330!2027-12-15,914,330!2028-08-10,1120,350!2025-08-28,279,330!2028-10-04,1162,350!2027-08-24,828,330-->

## types of memory errors

Many different types of memory errors can occur. Important one includes {@{access errors, uninitialized variables, and memory leak}@}. <!--SR:!2027-04-01,716,330-->

- __access errors__ ::@:: Invalid read/write of a pointer. Includes buffer overflow, buffer over-read, invalid page fault, use after free, etc. <!--SR:!2027-07-14,797,330!2027-09-07,837,330-->
  - __[buffer overflow](buffer%20overflow.md)__ ::@:: Out-of-bound writes can corrupt the content of adjacent objects, or internal data (like bookkeeping information for the [heap](memory%20management.md#HEAP)) or [return](return%20statement.md) addresses. <!--SR:!2027-05-31,761,330!2028-02-23,984,350-->
  - __[buffer over-read](buffer%20over-read.md)__ ::@:: Out-of-bound reads can reveal sensitive data or help attackers bypass [address space layout randomization](address%20space%20layout%20randomization.md). <!--SR:!2028-03-18,1006,350!2028-05-27,1060,350-->
  - __[invalid page fault](page%20fault.md#invalid)__ ::@:: Accessing a pointer outside the virtual memory space. A null pointer dereference will often cause an exception or program termination in most environments, but can cause corruption in operating system [kernels](kernel%20(operating%20system).md) or systems without [memory protection](memory%20protection.md), or when use of the null pointer involves a large or negative offset. <!--SR:!2026-06-05,424,290!2026-05-03,448,310-->
  - __use after free__ ::@:: Dereferencing a [dangling pointer](dangling%20pointer.md) storing the address of an object that has been deleted. <!--SR:!2028-04-14,1027,350!2025-08-16,267,330-->
- __[uninitialized variables](uninitialized%20variable.md)__ ::@:: A variable that has not been assigned a value is used. It may contain an undesired or, in some languages, a corrupt value. Includes null pointer deference, wild pointers, etc. <!--SR:!2026-09-30,547,290!2028-04-04,1018,350-->
  - __[null pointer](null%20pointer.md) dereference__ ::@:: Dereferencing an invalid pointer or a pointer to memory that has not been allocated <!--SR:!2028-08-21,1128,350!2028-09-09,1142,350-->
  - __[wild pointers](dangling%20pointer.md)__ ::@:: Arises when a pointer is used prior to initialization to some known state. They show the same erratic behaviour as dangling pointers, though they are less likely to stay undetected. <!--SR:!2025-08-15,266,330!2027-06-29,789,330-->
- __[memory leak](memory%20leak.md)__ ::@:: When memory usage is not tracked or is tracked incorrectly. Includes stack exhaustion, heap exhaustion, double free, invalid free, mismatched free, unwanted aliasing, etc. <!--SR:!2027-03-04,695,330!2027-08-20,824,330-->
  - __[stack exhaustion](stack%20overflow.md)__ ::@:: It occurs when a program runs out of stack space, typically because of too deep [recursion](recursion%20(computer%20science).md). A [guard page](memory%20protection.md) typically halts the program, preventing memory corruption, but functions with large [stack frames](call%20stack.md#STACK-FRAME) may bypass the page. <!--SR:!2027-09-02,832,330!2026-09-12,553,310-->
  - __[heap exhaustion](out%20of%20memory.md)__ ::@:: The program tries to [allocate](memory%20management.md) more memory than the amount available. In some languages, this condition must be checked for manually after each allocation. <!--SR:!2025-08-20,270,330!2025-08-25,274,330-->
  - __double free__ ::@:: Repeated calls to [free](c%20dynamic%20memory%20allocation.md) may prematurely free a new object at the same address. If the exact address has not been reused, other corruption may occur, especially in allocators that use [free lists](free%20list.md). <!--SR:!2026-11-28,626,330!2027-02-01,674,330-->
  - __invalid free__ ::@:: Passing an invalid address to [free](c%20dynamic%20memory%20allocation.md) can corrupt the [heap](memory%20management.md#heap). <!--SR:!2028-04-29,1038,350!2025-11-26,332,310-->
  - __mismatched free__ ::@:: When multiple allocators are in use, attempting to free memory with a deallocation function of a different allocator. <!--SR:!2027-11-28,918,350!2027-11-30,919,350-->
  - __unwanted [aliasing](aliasing%20(computing).md)__ ::@:: When the same memory location is allocated and modified twice for unrelated purposes. <!--SR:!2027-06-28,788,330!2026-03-31,426,310-->

Some lists may also {@{include __[race conditions](race%20condition.md)__ (concurrent reads/writes to shared memory)}@} as being part of memory safety (e.g., for access control). The Rust programming language {@{prevents many kinds of memory-based race conditions by default, because it ensures there is at most one writer _or_ one or more readers}@}. Many other programming languages, such as Java, {@{do _not_ automatically prevent memory-based race conditions, yet are still generally considered "memory safe" languages}@}. Therefore, {@{countering race conditions}@} is {@{generally _not_ considered necessary for a language to be considered memory safe}@}. <!--SR:!2028-02-09,942,330!2025-09-28,302,330!2028-01-25,964,350!2025-08-21,271,330!2025-09-25,299,330-->
