# sales

In {@{[bookkeeping](bookkeeping.md), [accounting](accounting.md), and [financial accounting](financial%20accounting.md)}@}, {@{__net sales__}@} are {@{operating [revenues](revenue.md) earned by a company for selling its products or rendering its services}@}. Also referred to as {@{__revenue__}@}, they are reported directly on {@{the [income statement](income%20statement.md) as _Sales_ or _Net sales_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-26,266,330!2025-12-03,250,330!2027-06-12,668,330!2025-12-04,251,330!2025-12-29,269,330-->

In {@{financial ratios that use income statement sales values}@}, "sales" refers to {@{net sales, not [gross sales](gross%20sales.md#gross%20sales%20and%20net%20sales)}@}. [Sales](sales.md) are {@{the unique transactions that occur in professional [selling](selling.md) or during [marketing](marketing.md) initiatives}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-01,272,330!2025-11-26,244,330!2027-01-19,541,310-->

Revenue is {@{earned when goods are delivered or services are rendered}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> The term sales in {@{a [marketing](marketing.md), [advertising](advertising.md) or a general business context}@} often refers to {@{a fee in which a buyer has agreed to purchase some products at a set time in the future}@}. From {@{an accounting standpoint}@}, sales do not {@{occur until the product is delivered}@}. "{@{Outstanding orders}@}" refers to {@{sales orders that have not been filled}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-09,255,330!2026-01-04,274,330!2026-01-23,290,330!2028-10-09,1061,350!2026-01-05,275,330!2026-01-04,275,330!2026-01-06,276,330-->

A sale is {@{a transfer of property for money or credit}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> In {@{[double-entry bookkeeping](double-entry%20bookkeeping.md)}@}, {@{a sale of [merchandise](merchandise.md)}@} is recorded {@{in the [general journal](general%20journal.md) as a [debit](debits%20and%20credits.md) to cash or [accounts receivable](accounts%20receivable.md) and a [credit](debits%20and%20credits.md) to the sales account}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> The amount recorded is {@{the actual monetary value of the transaction, not the [list price](list%20price.md) of the merchandise}@}. {@{A [discount](discounts%20and%20allowances.md) from list price}@} {@{might be noted if it applies to the sale}@}. <!--SR:!2027-11-28,802,330!2025-11-24,242,330!2025-12-09,255,330!2027-06-14,606,310!2026-01-23,290,330!2028-11-11,1087,350!2027-06-08,665,330-->

{@{Fees for services}@} are {@{recorded separately from sales of merchandise}@}, but {@{the bookkeeping transactions for recording "sales" of services}@} are {@{similar to those for recording sales of tangible goods}@}.<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> <!--SR:!2028-09-29,1051,350!2028-10-04,1055,350!2026-01-07,275,330!2027-06-29,681,330-->
