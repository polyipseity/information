# Henyey track

The __Henyey track__ is {@{a path taken by [pre-main-sequence stars](pre-main-sequence%20star.md) with masses greater than 0.5 [solar masses](solar%20mass.md) in the [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md) after the end of the [Hayashi track](Hayashi%20track.md)}@}. {@{The astronomer [Louis G. Henyey](Louis%20G.%20Henyey.md) and his colleagues in the 1950s}@} showed that {@{the pre-main-sequence star can remain in [radiative equilibrium](radiative%20equilibrium.md) throughout some period of its contraction to the main sequence}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-18,148,230!2025-03-11,51,230!2025-11-18,350,310-->

The Henyey track is characterized by {@{a slow collapse in near [hydrostatic equilibrium](hydrostatic%20equilibrium.md)}@}, approaching the main sequence {@{almost horizontally in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (i.e. the [luminosity](luminosity.md) remains almost constant)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-29,179,270!2025-03-10,153,270-->
