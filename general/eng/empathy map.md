- thinks ::@:: What the user thinks. Can overlap with says. Take note of thoughts that the user is unwilling to vocalize, such as body language, choice of words, tone, etc. <!--SR:!2025-04-01,207,270!2025-08-21,333,290-->
- does ::@:: The user's actions and behaviors. This is simply what the user is doing. <!--SR:!2028-04-05,1110,350!2025-04-24,269,330-->
- feels ::@:: The user's emotional state and its context, like the thing causing the emotional state. <!--SR:!2025-10-05,342,290!2025-06-10,297,310-->
