# empathy map

The empathy map can create {@{a shared understanding of user pains and gains, and uncover latent ones}@}.

## structure

The empathy map consists of {@{the user or persona at the center, and in Z order of the 4 quadrants: says, thinks, does, and feels}@}. The user is in the center to {@{remind who are we researching for}@}.

- says ::@:: What the user says, ideally verbatim. Can overlap with thinks.
- thinks ::@:: What the user thinks. Can overlap with says. Take note of thoughts that the user is unwilling to vocalize, such as body language, choice of words, tone, etc.
- does ::@:: The user's actions and behaviors. This is simply what the user is doing.
- feels ::@:: The user's emotional state and its context, like the thing causing the emotional state.
