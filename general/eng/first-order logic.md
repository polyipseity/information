{@{__First-order logic__, also called __predicate logic__, __predicate calculus__, or __quantificational logic__}@}, is {@{a collection of [formal systems](formal%20system.md) used in [mathematics](mathematics.md), [philosophy](philosophy.md), [linguistics](linguistics.md), and [computer science](computer%20science.md)}@}. First-order logic uses {@{[quantified variables](quantification%20(logic).md) over non-logical objects}@}, and allows {@{the use of sentences that contain variables}@}. Rather than {@{propositions such as "all humans are mortal"}@}, in first-order logic one can have {@{expressions in the form "for all _x_, if _x_ is a human, then _x_ is mortal"}@}, where {@{"for all _x"_ is a quantifier}@}, {@{_x_ is a variable}@}, and {@{"... _is a human_" and "... _is mortal_" are predicates}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> This distinguishes it from {@{[propositional logic](propositional%20logic.md)}@}, which {@{does not use quantifiers or [relations](finitary%20relation.md)}@};<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>:&hairsp;161&hairsp;</sup> in this sense, {@{propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic}@}.

{@{A theory about a topic}@}, such as {@{[set theory](set%20theory.md), a theory for groups,<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> or a formal theory of [arithmetic](arithmetic.md)}@}, is {@{usually a first-order logic together with a specified [domain of discourse](domain%20of%20discourse.md) \(over which the quantified variables range\)}@}, {@{finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many [predicates](predicate%20(mathematical%20logic).md) defined on that domain}@}, and {@{a set of axioms believed to hold about them}@}. {@{"Theory"}@} is sometimes {@{understood in a more formal sense as just a set of sentences in first-order logic}@}.

{@{The term "first-order"}@} distinguishes first-order logic from {@{[higher-order logic](higher-order%20logic.md)}@}, in which there are {@{predicates having predicates or functions as arguments}@}, or in which {@{quantification over predicates, functions, or both, are permitted}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup><sup>:&hairsp;56&hairsp;</sup> In {@{first-order theories}@}, predicates are often {@{associated with sets}@}. In {@{interpreted higher-order theories}@}, predicates may be {@{interpreted as sets of sets}@}.

There are {@{many [deductive systems](deductive%20system.md#deductive%20system) for first-order logic}@} which are both {@{[sound](soundness.md#logical%20systems), i.e. all provable statements are true in all models}@}; and {@{[complete](completeness%20(logic).md), i.e. all statements which are true in all models are provable}@}. Although {@{the [logical consequence](logical%20consequence.md) relation is only [semidecidable](semidecidability.md#semidecidability)}@}, much progress has been made in {@{[automated theorem proving](automated%20theorem%20proving.md) in first-order logic}@}. First-order logic also satisfies {@{several [metalogical](metalogic.md) theorems}@} that make it {@{amenable to analysis in [proof theory](proof%20theory.md)}@}, such as {@{the [Löwenheim–Skolem theorem](Löwenheim–Skolem%20theorem.md) and the [compactness theorem](compactness%20theorem.md)}@}.

First-order logic is {@{the standard for the formalization of mathematics into [axioms](axiomatic%20system.md)}@}, and is studied in {@{the [foundations of mathematics](foundations%20of%20mathematics.md)}@}. {@{[Peano arithmetic](Peano%20arithmetic.md) and [Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory](Zermelo–Fraenkel%20set%20theory.md)}@} are {@{axiomatizations of [number theory](number%20theory.md) and set theory, respectively, into first-order logic}@}. {@{No first-order theory}@}, however, has the strength to {@{uniquely describe a structure with an infinite domain}@}, such as {@{the [natural numbers](natural%20number.md) or the [real line](real%20line.md)}@}. {@{Axiom systems that do fully describe these two structures}@}, i.e. {@{[categorical](categorical%20theory.md) axiom systems}@}, can be obtained in {@{stronger logics such as [second-order logic](second-order%20logic.md)}@}.

{@{The foundations of first-order logic}@} were developed {@{independently by [Gottlob Frege](Gottlob%20Frege.md) and [Charles Sanders Peirce](Charles%20Sanders%20Peirce.md)}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> For {@{a history of first-order logic and how it came to dominate formal logic}@}, see {@{José Ferreirós \(2001\)}@}.

While {@{[propositional logic](propositional%20logic.md)}@} {@{deals with simple declarative propositions}@}, {@{first-order logic}@} additionally {@{covers [predicates](predicate%20(mathematical%20logic).md) and [quantification](quantification%20(logic).md)}@}. {@{A predicate}@} evaluates to {@{[true](true%20(logic).md) or [false](false%20(logic).md) for an entity or entities in the [domain of discourse](domain%20of%20discourse.md)}@}.

Consider {@{the two sentences "[Socrates](Socrates.md) is a philosopher"}@} and {@{"[Plato](Plato.md) is a philosopher"}@}. In {@{[propositional logic](propositional%20calculus.md)}@}, these sentences themselves are {@{viewed as the individuals of study}@}, and might be denoted, for example, by {@{variables such as _p_ and _q_}@}. They are not {@{viewed as an application of a predicate}@}, such as {@{${\text{isPhil} }$, to any particular objects in the domain of discourse}@}, instead viewing them as {@{purely an utterance which is either true or false}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> However, in {@{first-order logic}@}, these two sentences may be framed as {@{statements that a certain individual or non-logical object has a property}@}. In this example, {@{both sentences}@} happen to {@{have the common form ${\text{isPhil} }(x)$ for some individual $x$}@}, in {@{the first sentence}@} {@{the value of the variable _x_ is "Socrates"}@}, and in {@{the second sentence it is "Plato"}@}. Due to the ability to {@{speak about non-logical individuals along with the original logical connectives}@}, first-order logic {@{includes propositional logic}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup><sup>:&hairsp;29–30&hairsp;</sup>

{@{The truth of a formula}@} such as {@{"_x_ is a philosopher"}@} depends on {@{which object is denoted by _x_}@} and on {@{the interpretation of the predicate "is a philosopher"}@}. Consequently, {@{"_x_ is a philosopher" alone}@} {@{does not have a definite truth value of true or false}@}, and is akin to {@{a sentence fragment}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> {@{Relationships between predicates}@} can be stated using {@{[logical connectives](logical%20connective.md)}@}. For example, {@{the first-order formula}@} "if {@{_x_ is a philosopher}@}, then {@{_x_ is a scholar}@}", is {@{a [conditional](material%20conditional.md) statement}@} with {@{"_x_ is a philosopher" as its hypothesis, and "_x_ is a scholar" as its conclusion}@}, which again needs {@{specification of _x_ in order to have a definite truth value}@}.

{@{Quantifiers}@} can be {@{applied to variables in a formula}@}. {@{The variable _x_ in the previous formula}@} can be {@{universally quantified}@}, for instance, with {@{the first-order sentence}@} "For {@{every _x_}@}, if {@{_x_ is a philosopher, then _x_ is a scholar}@}". {@{The [universal quantifier](universal%20quantifier.md) "for every"}@} in this sentence expresses the idea that {@{the claim "if _x_ is a philosopher, then _x_ is a scholar" holds for _all_ choices of _x_}@}.

{@{The _[negation](negation.md)_ of the sentence}@} "For every _x_, if _x_ is a philosopher, then _x_ is a scholar" is {@{logically equivalent to the sentence "There exists _x_ such that _x_ is a philosopher and _x_ is not a scholar"}@}. {@{The [existential quantifier](existential%20quantifier.md) "there exists"}@} expresses the idea that {@{the claim "_x_ is a philosopher and _x_ is not a scholar" holds for _some_ choice of _x_}@}.

{@{The predicates "is a philosopher" and "is a scholar"}@} each {@{take a single variable}@}. In general, predicates can {@{take several variables}@}. In {@{the first-order sentence}@} {@{"Socrates is the teacher of Plato"}@}, {@{the predicate "is the teacher of"}@} {@{takes two variables}@}.

{@{An interpretation \(or model\) of a first-order formula}@} specifies {@{what each predicate means}@}, and {@{the entities that can instantiate the variables}@}. These entities form {@{the [domain of discourse](domain%20of%20discourse.md) or universe}@}, which is {@{usually required to be a nonempty set}@}. For example, consider {@{the sentence "There exists _x_ such that _x_ is a philosopher."}@} This sentence is {@{seen as being true in an interpretation}@} such that {@{the domain of discourse consists of all human beings}@}, and that {@{the predicate "is a philosopher"}@} is understood as {@{"was the author of the _[Republic](Republic%20(Plato).md)_."}@} It is {@{true, as witnessed by Plato in that text}@}.<sup>\[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please%20clarify)_\]</sup>

There are {@{two key parts}@} of first-order logic. {@{The [syntax](syntax.md)}@} determines {@{which finite sequences of symbols are well-formed expressions in first-order logic}@}, while {@{the [semantics](semantics.md)}@} determines {@{the meanings behind these expressions}@}.

Unlike {@{natural languages, such as English}@}, {@{the language of first-order logic}@} is {@{completely formal}@}, so that it can be {@{mechanically determined whether a given expression is [well formed](well-formedness.md)}@}. There are {@{two key types of well-formed expressions}@}: {@{_terms_}@}, which {@{intuitively represent objects}@}, and {@{_formulas_}@}, which {@{intuitively express statements that can be true or false}@}. {@{The terms and formulas of first-order logic}@} are {@{strings of _[symbols](symbol%20(formal).md)_}@}, where all the symbols together {@{form the _[alphabet](alphabet%20(formal%20languages).md)_ of the language}@}.

### alphabet

- See also: ::@:: [Alphabet \(formal languages\)](alphabet%20(formal%20languages).md) and [Symbol \(formal\)](symbol%20(formal).md)

As with {@{all [formal languages](formal%20language.md)}@}, {@{the nature of the symbols themselves}@} is {@{outside the scope of formal logic}@}; they are often {@{regarded simply as letters and punctuation symbols}@}.

It is common to {@{divide the symbols of the alphabet into _logical symbols_, which always have the same meaning}@}, and {@{_non-logical symbols_, whose meaning varies by interpretation}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> For example, {@{the logical symbol $\land$}@} {@{always represents "and"}@}; it is {@{never interpreted as "or"}@}, which is {@{represented by the logical symbol $\lor$}@}. However, {@{a non-logical predicate symbol such as Phil\(_x_\)}@} could be {@{interpreted to mean "_x_ is a philosopher", "_x_ is a man named Philip"}@}, or {@{any other unary predicate depending on the interpretation at hand}@}.

#### logical symbols

- Main article: ::@:: [List of logical symbols](list%20of%20logical%20symbols.md)

{@{Logical symbols}@} are {@{a set of characters that vary by author}@}, but usually include the following:<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup>

- {@{[Quantifier](quantifier%20(logic).md) symbols}@}: {@{[∀](universal%20quantification.md)}@} for {@{universal quantification}@}, and {@{[∃](existential%20quantification.md)}@} for {@{existential quantification}@}
- {@{[Logical connectives](logical%20connective.md)}@}: {@{∧}@} for {@{[conjunction](logical%20conjunction.md)}@}, {@{∨}@} for {@{[disjunction](disjunction.md)}@}, {@{→}@} for {@{[implication](material%20conditional.md)}@}, {@{↔}@} for {@{[biconditional](logical%20biconditional.md)}@}, {@{¬}@} for {@{negation}@}. Some authors<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> use {@{C<!-- markdown separator -->_pq_ instead of →}@} and {@{E<!-- markdown separator -->_pq_ instead of ↔}@}, especially in {@{contexts where → is used for other purposes}@}. Moreover, {@{the horseshoe ⊃}@} may {@{replace →}@};<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> {@{the triple-bar ≡}@} may {@{replace ↔}@}; {@{a tilde \(~\), N<!-- markdown separator -->_p_, or F<!-- markdown separator -->_p_}@} may {@{replace ¬}@}; {@{a double bar $\|$, $+$,<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> or A<!-- markdown separator -->_pq_}@} may {@{replace ∨}@}; and {@{an ampersand &, K<!-- markdown separator -->_pq_, or the middle dot ⋅}@} may {@{replace ∧}@}, especially if {@{these symbols are not available for technical reasons}@}.
- {@{Parentheses, brackets, and other punctuation symbols}@}. {@{The choice of such symbols}@} varies {@{depending on context}@}.
- {@{An infinite set of _variables_}@}, often denoted by {@{lowercase letters at the end of the alphabet _x_, _y_, _z_, ...}@} . {@{Subscripts}@} are {@{often used to distinguish variables}@}: {@{_x_<sub>0</sub>, _x_<sub>1</sub>, _x_<sub>2</sub>, ...}@} .
- {@{An _equality symbol_ \(sometimes, _identity symbol_\) =}@} \(see {@{[§ Equality and its axioms](#equality%20and%20its%20axioms)}@} below\).

{@{Not all of these symbols}@} are {@{required in first-order logic}@}. {@{Either one of the quantifiers}@} along with {@{negation, conjunction \(or disjunction\)}@}, {@{variables, brackets, and equality}@} suffices.

Other logical symbols include the following:

- Truth constants: ::@:: T, or ⊤ for "true" and F, or ⊥ for "false". Without any such logical operators of valence 0, these two constants can only be expressed using quantifiers.
- Additional logical connectives ::@:: such as the [Sheffer stroke](Sheffer%20stroke.md), D<!-- markdown separator -->_pq_ \(NAND\), and [exclusive or](exclusive%20or.md), J<!-- markdown separator -->_pq_.

#### non-logical symbols

{@{[Non-logical symbols](non-logical%20symbol.md)}@} represent {@{predicates \(relations\), functions and constants}@}. It used to be {@{standard practice}@} to use {@{a fixed, infinite set of non-logical symbols for all purposes}@}:

- For every integer _n_ ≥ 0, there is a collection of [_n_-_ary_](arity.md), or _n_-_place_, _[predicate symbols](predicate%20symbol.md)_. Because they represent [relations](finitary%20relation.md) between _n_ elements, they are also called _relation symbols_. For each arity _n_, there is an infinite supply of them: <p> ::@:: &emsp; _P_<sup>_n_</sup><sub>0</sub>, _P_<sup>_n_</sup><sub>1</sub>, _P_<sup>_n_</sup><sub>2</sub>, _P_<sup>_n_</sup><sub>3</sub>, ...
- For every integer _n_ ≥ 0, there are infinitely many _n_-ary _function symbols_: <p> ::@:: &emsp; _f<sup> n</sup>_<sub>0</sub>, _f<sup> n</sup>_<sub>1</sub>, _f<sup> n</sup>_<sub>2</sub>, _f<sup> n</sup>_<sub>3</sub>, ...

When {@{the arity of a predicate symbol or function symbol is clear from context}@}, {@{the superscript _n_}@} is {@{often omitted}@}.

In {@{this traditional approach}@}, there is {@{only one language of first-order logic}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> This approach is {@{still common}@}, especially in {@{philosophically oriented books}@}.

{@{A more recent practice}@} is to {@{use different non-logical symbols}@} according to {@{the application one has in mind}@}. Therefore, it has become {@{necessary to name the set of all non-logical symbols used in a particular application}@}. {@{This choice}@} is made via {@{a _[signature](signature%20(logic).md)_}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup>

{@{Typical signatures in mathematics}@} are {@{<!-- flashcard separator -->{1, ×} or just {×}<!-- flashcard separator -->}@} for {@{[groups](group%20(mathematics).md)}@},<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> or {@{<!-- flashcard separator -->{0, 1, +, ×, \<}<!-- flashcard separator -->}@} for {@{[ordered fields](ordered%20field.md)}@}. There are {@{no restrictions}@} on {@{the number of non-logical symbols}@}. {@{The signature}@} can be {@{[empty](empty%20set.md), finite, or infinite, even [uncountable](uncountable.md)}@}. {@{Uncountable signatures occur}@} for example in {@{modern proofs of the [Löwenheim–Skolem theorem](Löwenheim–Skolem%20theorem.md)}@}.

Though {@{signatures}@} might {@{in some cases imply how non-logical symbols are to be interpreted}@}, {@{[interpretation](#semantics) of the non-logical symbols in the signature}@} is {@{separate \(and not necessarily fixed\)}@}. Signatures concern {@{syntax rather than semantics}@}.

In this approach, {@{every non-logical symbol}@} is {@{of one of the following types}@}:

- A _predicate symbol_ \(or _relation symbol_\) with some _valence_ \(or _arity_, number of arguments\) greater than or equal to 0. ::@:: These are often denoted by uppercase letters such as _P_, _Q_ and _R_. Examples:
  - In _P_\(_x_\), ::@:: _P_ is a predicate symbol of valence 1. One possible interpretation is "_x_ is a man".
  - In _Q_\(_x_,_y_\), ::@:: _Q_ is a predicate symbol of valence 2. Possible interpretations include "_x_ is greater than _y_" and "_x_ is the father of _y_".
  - Relations of valence 0 ::@:: can be identified with [propositional variables](propositional%20variable.md), which can stand for any statement. One possible interpretation of _R_ is "Socrates is a man".
- A _function symbol_, with some valence greater than or equal to 0. ::@:: These are often denoted by lowercase [roman letters](Latin%20script.md) such as _f_, _g_ and _h_. Examples:
  - _f_\(_x_\) ::@:: may be interpreted as "the father of _x_". In [arithmetic](arithmetic.md), it may stand for "-x". In set theory, it may stand for "the [power set](power%20set.md) of x".
  - In arithmetic, _g_\(_x_,_y_\) ::@:: may stand for "_x_+_y_". In set theory, it may stand for "the union of _x_ and _y_".
  - Function symbols of valence 0 are called _constant symbols_, and are often denoted by lowercase letters at the beginning of the alphabet such as _a_, _b_ and _c_. ::@:: The symbol _a_ may stand for Socrates. In arithmetic, it may stand for 0. In set theory, it may stand for the [empty set](empty%20set.md).

{@{The traditional approach}@} can be {@{recovered in the modern approach}@}, by {@{simply specifying the "custom" signature}@} to {@{consist of the traditional sequences of non-logical symbols}@}.

{@{The [formation rules](formation%20rule.md)}@} define {@{the terms and formulas of first-order logic}@}.<sup>[\[16\]](#^ref-16)</sup> When {@{terms and formulas}@} are {@{represented as strings of symbols}@}, these rules can be {@{used to write a [formal grammar](formal%20grammar.md) for terms and formulas}@}. These rules are {@{generally [context-free](context-free%20grammar.md)}@} \({@{each production}@} has {@{a single symbol on the left side}@}\), except that {@{the set of symbols}@} may be {@{allowed to be infinite}@} and there may be {@{many start symbols}@}, for example {@{the variables in the case of [terms](#terms)}@}.

#### terms

{@{The set of _[terms](term%20(logic).md)_}@} is {@{[inductively defined](inductive%20definition.md) by the following rules}@}:<sup>[\[17\]](#^ref-17)</sup>

1. _Variables_. ::@:: Any variable symbol is a term.
2. _Functions_. ::@:: If _f_ is an _n_-ary function symbol, and _t_<sub>1</sub>, ..., _t_<sub>_n_</sub> are terms, then _f_\(_t_<sub>1</sub>,...,_t_<sub>_n_</sub>\) is a term. In particular, symbols denoting individual constants are nullary function symbols, and thus are terms.

{@{Only expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1 and 2}@} are {@{terms}@}. For example, {@{no expression involving a predicate symbol}@} is {@{a term}@}.

#### formulas

{@{The set of _[formulas](formula%20(mathematical%20logic).md)_}@} \(also called {@{_[well-formed formulas](well-formed%20formula.md)_<sup>[\[18\]](#^ref-18)</sup> or _WFFs_}@}\) is {@{inductively defined by the following rules}@}:

1. _Predicate symbols_. ::@:: If _P_ is an _n_-ary predicate symbol and _t_<sub>1</sub>, ..., _t_<sub>_n_</sub> are terms then _P_\(_t_<sub>1</sub>,...,_t_<sub>_n_</sub>\) is a formula.
    - _[Equality](equality%20(mathematics).md)_. ::@:: If the equality symbol is considered part of logic, and _t_<sub>1</sub> and _t_<sub>2</sub> are terms, then _t_<sub>1</sub> = _t_<sub>2</sub> is a formula.
2. _Negation_. ::@:: If $\varphi$ is a formula, then $\lnot \varphi$ is a formula.
3. _Binary connectives_. ::@:: If ⁠$\varphi$⁠ and ⁠$\psi$⁠ are formulas, then \($\varphi \rightarrow \psi$\) is a formula. Similar rules apply to other binary logical connectives.
4. _Quantifiers_. ::@:: If $\varphi$ is a formula and _x_ is a variable, then $\forall x\varphi$ \(for all x, $\varphi$ holds\) and $\exists x\varphi$ \(there exists x such that $\varphi$\) are formulas.

{@{Only expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1–5}@} are {@{formulas}@}. {@{The formulas obtained from the first two rules \(annotation: predicate symbols, negation\)}@} are said to be {@{_[atomic formulas](atomic%20formula.md)_}@}.

For example: {@{$$\forall x\forall y(P(f(x))\rightarrow \neg (P(x)\rightarrow Q(f(y),x,z)))$$}@} is {@{a formula}@}, if {@{_f_ is a unary function symbol, _P_ a unary predicate symbol, and _Q_ a ternary predicate symbol}@}. However, {@{$\forall x\,x\rightarrow$}@} is {@{not a formula}@}, although it is {@{a string of symbols from the alphabet}@}.

{@{The role of the parentheses in the definition}@} is to {@{ensure that any formula can only be obtained in one way}@}—by {@{following the inductive definition}@} \(i.e., there is {@{a unique [parse tree](parse%20tree.md) for each formula}@}\). This property is known as {@{_unique readability_ of formulas}@}. There are {@{many conventions for where parentheses are used in formulas}@}. For example, some authors use {@{colons or full stops instead of parentheses}@}, or change {@{the places in which parentheses are inserted}@}. {@{Each author's particular definition}@} must be {@{accompanied by a proof of unique readability}@}.

#### notational conventions

For {@{convenience}@}, {@{conventions have been developed}@} about {@{the precedence of the logical operators}@}, to {@{avoid the need to write parentheses in some cases}@}. These rules are similar to {@{the [order of operations](order%20of%20operations.md) in arithmetic}@}. A common convention is: \(annotation: 4 ordered items: {@{$\lnot$ &gt; $\land$, $\lor$ &gt; quantifiers &gt; $\to$}@}\)

- $\lnot$ is evaluated first
- $\land$ and $\lor$ are evaluated next
- Quantifiers are evaluated next
- $\to$ is evaluated last.

Moreover, {@{extra punctuation not required by the definition}@} may be {@{inserted—to make formulas easier to read}@}. Thus the formula: {@{$$\lnot \forall xP(x)\to \exists x\lnot P(x)$$}@} might be written as: {@{$$(\lnot [\forall xP(x)])\to \exists x[\lnot P(x)].$$}@}

### free and bound variables

- Main article: ::@:: [Free variables and bound variables](free%20variables%20and%20bound%20variables.md)

In {@{a formula}@}, {@{a variable}@} may {@{occur _free_ or _bound_ \(or both\)}@}. {@{One formalization of this notion}@} is {@{due to Quine}@}, first {@{the concept of a variable occurrence is defined}@}, then whether {@{a variable occurrence is free or bound}@}, then whether {@{a variable symbol overall is free or bound}@}. In order to {@{distinguish different occurrences of the identical symbol _x_}@}, {@{each occurrence of a variable symbol _x_}@} in a formula φ is {@{identified with the initial substring of φ}@} up to {@{the point at which said instance of the symbol _x_ appears}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup><sup>p.297</sup> Then, {@{an occurrence of _x_ is said to be bound}@} if {@{that occurrence of _x_ lies within the scope of at least one of either $\exists x$ or $\forall x$}@}. Finally, {@{_x_ is bound in φ}@} if {@{all occurrences of _x_ in φ are bound}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup><sup>pp.142--143</sup>

Intuitively, {@{a variable symbol is free}@} in a formula if {@{at no point is it quantified}@}:<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup><sup>pp.142--143</sup> in {@{∀<!-- markdown separator -->_y_ _P_\(_x_, _y_\)}@}, {@{the sole occurrence of variable _x_ is free}@} while {@{that of _y_ is bound}@}. {@{The free and bound variable occurrences}@} in a formula are {@{defined inductively as follows}@}.

__Atomic formulas__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; If _φ_ is an atomic formula, then _x_ occurs free in _φ_ if and only if _x_ occurs in _φ_. Moreover, there are no bound variables in any atomic formula.

__Negation__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; _x_ occurs free in ¬<!-- markdown separator -->_φ_ if and only if _x_ occurs free in _φ_. _x_ occurs bound in ¬<!-- markdown separator -->_φ_ if and only if _x_ occurs bound in _φ_ \(annotation: i.e. both freeness and boundedness are preserved\)

__Binary connectives__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; _x_ occurs free in \(_φ_ → _ψ_\) if and only if _x_ occurs free in either _φ_ or _ψ_. _x_ occurs bound in \(_φ_ → _ψ_\) if and only if _x_ occurs bound in either _φ_ or _ψ_. The same rule applies to any other binary connective in place of →.

__Quantifiers__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; _x_ occurs free in ∀<!-- markdown separator -->_y_ _φ_, if and only if x occurs free in _φ_ and _x_ is a different symbol from _y_. Also, _x_ occurs bound in ∀<!-- markdown separator -->_y_ _φ_, if and only if _x_ is _y_ or _x_ occurs bound in _φ_. The same rule holds with ∃ in place of ∀.

For example, in {@{∀<!-- markdown separator -->_x_ ∀<!-- markdown separator -->_y_ \(_P_\(_x_\) → _Q_\(_x_,_f_\(_x_\),_z_\)\)}@}, {@{_x_ and _y_ occur only bound}@},<sup>[\[19\]](#^ref-19)</sup> {@{_z_ occurs only free}@}, and {@{_w_ is neither because it does not occur in the formula}@}.

{@{Free and bound variables of a formula}@} {@{need not be disjoint sets}@}: in {@{the formula _P_\(_x_\) → ∀<!-- markdown separator -->_x_ _Q_\(_x_\)}@}, {@{the first occurrence of _x_, as argument of _P_}@}, is {@{free}@} while {@{the second one, as argument of _Q_, is bound}@}.

{@{A formula in first-order logic with no free variable occurrences}@} is called {@{a _first-order [sentence](sentence%20(mathematical%20logic).md)_}@}. These are {@{the formulas that will have well-defined [truth values](truth%20value.md) under an interpretation}@}. For example, whether {@{a formula such as Phil\(_x_\) is true}@} must {@{depend on what _x_ represents}@}. But {@{the sentence ∃<!-- markdown separator -->_x_ Phil\(_x_\)}@} will be {@{either true or false in a given interpretation}@}.

### example: ordered abelian groups

In {@{mathematics}@}, {@{the language of ordered [abelian groups](abelian%20group.md)}@} has {@{one constant symbol 0, one unary function symbol −, one binary function symbol +, and one binary relation symbol ≤}@}. Then:

- The expressions {@{+\(_x_, _y_\) and +\(_x_, +\(_y_, −\(_z_\)\)\)}@} are {@{_terms_}@}. These are usually written as {@{_x_ + _y_ and _x_ + _y_ − _z_}@}.
- The expressions {@{+\(_x_, _y_\) = 0 and ≤\(+\(_x_, +\(_y_, −\(_z_\)\)\), +\(_x_, _y_\)\)}@} are {@{_atomic formulas_}@}. These are usually written as {@{_x_ + _y_ = 0 and _x_ + _y_ − _z_  ≤  _x_ + _y_}@}.
- The expression {@{$(\forall x\forall y\,[\mathop {\leq } (\mathop {+} (x,y),z)\to \forall x\,\forall y\,\mathop {+} (x,y)=0)]$}@} is {@{a _formula_}@}, which is usually written as {@{$\forall x\forall y(x+y\leq z)\to \forall x\forall y(x+y=0)$}@}. This formula has {@{one free variable, _z_}@}.

{@{The axioms for ordered abelian groups}@} can be {@{expressed as a set of sentences in the language}@}. For example, {@{the axiom stating that the group is commutative}@} is usually written {@{$(\forall x)[\forall y](x+y=y+x)$}@}.

## semantics

{@{An [interpretation](interpretation%20(logic).md) of a first-order language}@} assigns {@{a denotation to each non-logical symbol}@} \({@{predicate symbol, function symbol, or constant symbol}@}\) in {@{that language}@}. It also determines {@{a [domain of discourse](domain%20of%20discourse.md)}@} that {@{specifies the range of the quantifiers}@}. The result is that {@{each term}@} is {@{assigned an object that it represents}@}, {@{each predicate}@} is {@{assigned a property of objects}@}, and {@{each sentence}@} is {@{assigned a truth value}@}. In this way, {@{an interpretation}@} provides {@{semantic meanin to the terms, predicates, and formulas of the language}@}. {@{The study of the interpretations of formal languages}@} is called {@{[formal semantics](formal%20semantics%20(logic).md)}@}. What follows is a description of {@{the standard or [Tarskian](truth%20definition.md#Tarski's%20theory%20of%20truth) semantics for first-order logic}@}. \(It is also possible to {@{define [game semantics for first-order logic](game%20semantics.md#classical%20logic)}@}, but aside from {@{requiring the [axiom of choice](axiom%20of%20choice.md)}@}, {@{game semantics agree with Tarskian semantics for first-order logic}@}, so {@{game semantics will not be elaborated herein}@}.\)

### first-order structures

- Main article: ::@:: [Structure \(mathematical logic\)](structure%20(mathematical%20logic).md)

{@{The most common way of specifying an interpretation}@} \(especially in {@{mathematics}@}\) is to {@{specify a _structure_ \(also called a _model_; see below\)}@}. The structure consists of {@{a domain of discourse _D_ and an interpretation function _I_}@} mapping {@{non-logical symbols to predicates, functions, and constants}@}.

{@{The domain of discourse _D_}@} is {@{a nonempty set of "objects" of some kind}@}. Intuitively, given {@{an interpretation}@}, {@{a first-order formula}@} becomes {@{a statement about these objects}@}; for example, {@{$\exists xP(x)$}@} states {@{the existence of some object in _D_ for which the predicate _P_ is true}@} \(or, more precisely, for which {@{the predicate assigned to the predicate symbol _P_ by the interpretation is true}@}\). For example, one can take {@{_D_ to be the set of [integers](integer.md)}@}.

Non-logical symbols are interpreted as follows:

- {@{The interpretation of an _n_-ary function symbol}@} is {@{a function from _D_<sup>_n_</sup> to _D_}@}. For example, if {@{the domain of discourse}@} is {@{the set of integers}@}, {@{a function symbol _f_ of arity 2}@} can be {@{interpreted as the function that gives the sum of its arguments}@}. In other words, {@{the symbol _f_}@} is {@{associated with the function ⁠$I(f)$}@}⁠ which, {@{in this interpretation, is addition}@}.
- {@{The interpretation of a constant symbol \(a function symbol of arity 0\)}@} is {@{a function from _D_<sup>0</sup> \(a set whose only member is the empty [tuple](tuple.md)\) to _D_}@}, which can be {@{simply identified with an object in _D_}@}. For example, an interpretation may assign {@{the value $I(c)=10$ to the constant symbol $c$}@}.
- {@{The interpretation of an _n_-ary predicate symbol}@} is {@{a set of _n_-tuples of elements of _D_}@}, giving {@{the arguments for which the predicate is true}@}. For example, {@{an interpretation $I(P)$ of a binary predicate symbol _P_}@} may be {@{the set of pairs of integers}@} such that {@{the first one is less than the second}@}. According to this interpretation, the predicate _P_ {@{would be true}@} if {@{its first argument is less than its second argument}@}. Equivalently, predicate symbols may be {@{assigned [Boolean-valued functions](Boolean-valued%20function.md) from _D_<sup>_n_</sup> to $\{\mathrm {true,false} \}$}@}.

### evaluation of truth values

<!-- | ![](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Question%20book-new.svg) | This section __does not [cite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing%20sources) any [sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability)__. Please help [improve this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:EditPage/First-order%20logic) by [adding citations to reliable sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Referencing%20for%20beginners). Unsourced material may be challenged and [removed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence). _\(July 2023\)__\([Learn how and when to remove this message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Maintenance%20template%20removal)\)_ | -->

A formula {@{evaluates to true or false}@} given {@{an interpretation and a __variable assignment__ μ}@} that {@{associates an element of the domain of discourse with each variable}@}. The reason that {@{a variable assignment is required}@} is to {@{give meanings to formulas with free variables}@}, such as {@{$y=x$}@}. {@{The truth value of this formula}@} {@{changes depending on the values that _x_ and _y_ denote}@}.

First, {@{the variable assignment μ}@} can be {@{extended to all terms of the language}@}, with the result that {@{each term maps to a single element of the domain of discourse}@}. {@{The following rules}@} are used to make this assignment:

- _Variables_. ::@:: Each variable _x_ evaluates to _μ_\(_x_\)
- _Functions_. ::@:: Given terms $t_{1},\ldots ,t_{n}$ that have been evaluated to elements $d_{1},\ldots ,d_{n}$ of the domain of discourse, and a _n_-ary function symbol _f_, the term $f(t_{1},\ldots ,t_{n})$ evaluates to $(I(f))(d_{1},\ldots ,d_{n})$.

Next, {@{each formula}@} is {@{assigned a truth value}@}. {@{The inductive definition used to make this assignment}@} is called {@{the [T-schema](T-schema.md)}@}.

- _Atomic formulas \(1\)_. ::@:: A formula $P(t_{1},\ldots ,t_{n})$ is associated the value true or false depending on whether $\langle v_{1},\ldots ,v_{n}\rangle \in I(P)$, where $v_{1},\ldots ,v_{n}$ are the evaluation of the terms $t_{1},\ldots ,t_{n}$ and $I(P)$ is the interpretation of $P$, which by assumption is a subset of $D^{n}$.
- _Atomic formulas \(2\)_. ::@:: A formula $t_{1}=t_{2}$ is assigned true if $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ evaluate to the same object of the domain of discourse \(see the section on equality below\).
- _Logical connectives_. ::@:: A formula in the form $\neg \varphi$, $\varphi \rightarrow \psi$, etc. is evaluated according to the [truth table](truth%20table.md) for the connective in question, as in propositional logic.
- _Existential quantifiers_. ::@:: A formula $\exists x\varphi (x)$ is true according to _M_ and $\mu$ if there exists an evaluation $\mu '$ of the variables that differs from $\mu$ at most regarding the evaluation of _x_ and such that φ is true according to the interpretation _M_ and the variable assignment $\mu '$. This formal definition captures the idea that $\exists x\varphi (x)$ is true if and only if there is a way to choose a value for _x_ such that φ\(_x_\) is satisfied.
- _Universal quantifiers_. ::@:: A formula $\forall x\varphi (x)$ is true according to _M_ and $\mu$ if φ\(_x_\) is true for every pair composed by the interpretation _M_ and some variable assignment $\mu '$ that differs from $\mu$ at most on the value of _x_. This captures the idea that $\forall x\varphi (x)$ is true if every possible choice of a value for _x_ causes φ\(_x_\) to be true.

If {@{a formula does not contain free variables}@}, and thus is {@{a sentence}@}, then {@{the initial variable assignment}@} {@{does not affect its truth value}@}. In {@{other words}@}, a sentence is {@{true according to _M_ and $\mu$}@} {@{if and only if it is true according to _M_ and every other variable assignment $\mu '$}@}.

There is {@{a second common approach}@} to {@{defining truth values that does not rely on variable assignment functions}@}. Instead, given {@{an interpretation _M_}@}, one first {@{adds to the signature}@} {@{a collection of constant symbols}@}, one for {@{each element of the domain of discourse in _M_}@}; say that for {@{each _d_ in the domain}@} {@{the constant symbol _c_<sub>_d_</sub> is fixed}@}. {@{The interpretation is extended}@} so that {@{each new constant symbol is assigned to its corresponding element of the domain}@}. One now defines {@{truth for quantified formulas syntactically}@}, as follows:

- _Existential quantifiers \(alternate\)_. ::@:: A formula $\exists x\varphi (x)$ is true according to _M_ if there is some _d_ in the domain of discourse such that $\varphi (c_{d})$ holds. Here $\varphi (c_{d})$ is the result of substituting _c_<sub>_d_</sub> for every free occurrence of _x_ in φ.
- _Universal quantifiers \(alternate\)_. ::@:: A formula $\forall x\varphi (x)$ is true according to _M_ if, for every _d_ in the domain of discourse, $\varphi (c_{d})$ is true according to _M_.

{@{This alternate approach}@} gives {@{exactly the same truth values to all sentences}@} as {@{the approach via variable assignments}@}.

### validity, satisfiability, and logical consequence

- See also: ::@:: [Satisfiability](satisfiability.md)

If {@{a sentence φ evaluates to _true_}@} under {@{a given interpretation _M_}@}, one says that {@{_M_ _satisfies_ φ}@}; this is denoted<sup>[\[20\]](#^ref-20)</sup> {@{$M\vDash \varphi$}@}. {@{A sentence is _satisfiable_}@} if {@{there is some interpretation under which it is true}@}. This is {@{a bit different from the symbol $\vDash$ from model theory}@}, where {@{$M\vDash \phi$ denotes satisfiability in a model}@}, i.e. "there is {@{a suitable assignment of values in $M$<!-- LaTeX separator -->'s domain}@} to {@{variable symbols of $\phi$}@}".<sup>[\[21\]](#^ref-21)</sup>

{@{Satisfiability of formulas with free variables}@} is {@{more complicated}@}, because {@{an interpretation on its own}@} {@{does not determine the truth value of such a formula}@}. {@{The most common convention}@} is that {@{a formula φ with free variables $x_{1}$, ..., $x_{n}$}@} is {@{said to be satisfied by an interpretation}@} if {@{the formula φ remains true}@} regardless {@{which individuals from the domain of discourse are assigned to its free variables $x_{1}$, ..., $x_{n}$}@}. This has the same effect as saying that {@{a formula φ is satisfied}@} {@{if and only if its [universal closure](universal%20closure.md#universal%20closure) $\forall x_{1}\dots \forall x_{n}\phi (x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})$ is satisfied}@}.

{@{A formula is _logically valid_ \(or simply _valid_\)}@} if {@{it is true in every interpretation}@}.<sup>[\[22\]](#^ref-22)</sup> These formulas play {@{a role similar to [tautologies](tautology%20(logic).md) in propositional logic}@}.

{@{A formula φ is a _logical consequence_ of a formula ψ}@} if {@{every interpretation that makes ψ true also makes φ true}@}. In this case one says that {@{φ is logically implied by ψ}@}.

### algebraizations

{@{An alternate approach to the semantics}@} of first-order logic proceeds via {@{[abstract algebra](abstract%20algebra.md)}@}. This approach {@{generalizes the [Lindenbaum–Tarski algebras](Lindenbaum–Tarski%20algebra.md) of propositional logic}@}. There are {@{three ways of eliminating quantified variables}@} from first-order logic that {@{do not involve replacing quantifiers with other variable binding term operators}@}: \(annotation: 3 items: {@{cylindric algebra, polyadic algebra, predicate functor logic}@}\)

- [Cylindric algebra](cylindric%20algebra.md), ::@:: by [Alfred Tarski](Alfred%20Tarski.md), et al.;
- [Polyadic algebra](polyadic%20algebra.md), ::@:: by [Paul Halmos](Paul%20Halmos.md);
- [Predicate functor logic](predicate%20functor%20logic.md), ::@:: primarily by [Willard Quine](Willard%20Van%20Orman%20Quine.md).

{@{These [algebras](algebra.md)}@} are {@{all [lattices](lattice%20(order).md)}@} that {@{properly extend the [two-element Boolean algebra](Two-element%20Boolean%20algebra.md)}@}.

{@{Tarski and Givant \(1987\)}@} showed that {@{the fragment of first-order logic}@} that {@{has no [atomic sentence](atomic%20sentence.md) lying in the scope of more than three quantifiers}@} has {@{the same expressive power as [relation algebra](relation%20algebra.md)}@}.<sup>[\[23\]](#^ref-23)</sup><sup>:&hairsp;32–33&hairsp;</sup> This fragment is {@{of great interest}@} because it {@{suffices for [Peano arithmetic](Peano%20arithmetic.md) and most [axiomatic set theory](axiomatic%20set%20theory.md#formalized%20set%20theory)}@}, including {@{the canonical [Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory](Zermelo–Fraenkel%20set%20theory.md) \(ZFC\)}@}. They also prove that {@{first-order logic with a primitive [ordered pair](ordered%20pair.md)}@} is {@{equivalent to a relation algebra with two ordered pair [projection functions](projection%20function.md)}@}.<sup>[\[24\]](#^ref-24)</sup><sup>:&hairsp;803&hairsp;</sup>

### first-order theories, models, and elementary classes

{@{A _first-order theory_}@} of {@{a particular signature}@} is {@{a set of [axioms](axiom.md)}@}, which are {@{sentences consisting of symbols from that signature}@}. {@{The set of axioms}@} is often {@{finite or [recursively enumerable](recursively%20enumerable.md)}@}, in which case {@{the theory is called _effective_}@}. Some authors require theories to {@{also include all logical consequences of the axioms}@}. {@{The axioms}@} are {@{considered to hold within the theory}@} and from them {@{other sentences that hold within the theory can be derived}@}.

{@{A first-order structure}@} that {@{satisfies all sentences in a given theory}@} is said to be {@{a _model_ of the theory}@}. {@{An _[elementary class](elementary%20class.md)_}@} is {@{the set of all structures satisfying a particular theory}@}. These classes are {@{a main subject of study in [model theory](model%20theory.md)}@}.

{@{Many theories}@} have {@{an _[intended interpretation](intended%20interpretation.md#intended%20interpretations)_}@}, {@{a certain model}@} that is {@{kept in mind when studying the theory}@}. For example, {@{the intended interpretation of [Peano arithmetic](Peano%20arithmetic.md)}@} consists of {@{the usual [natural numbers](natural%20number.md) with their usual operations}@}. However, {@{the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem}@} shows that {@{most first-order theories}@} will also {@{have other, [nonstandard models](nonstandard%20model.md)}@}.

{@{A theory is _[consistent](consistency.md)_}@} \(within {@{a [deductive system](#deductive%20systems)}@}\) if {@{it is not possible to prove a contradiction from the axioms of the theory}@}. {@{A theory is _[complete](complete%20theory.md)_}@} if, for {@{every formula in its signature}@}, {@{either that formula or its negation}@} is {@{a logical consequence of the axioms of the theory}@}. {@{[Gödel's incompleteness theorem](Gödel's%20incompleteness%20theorem.md)}@} shows that {@{effective first-order theories}@} that {@{include a sufficient portion of the theory of the natural numbers}@} can {@{never be both consistent and complete}@}.

### empty domains

- Main article: ::@:: [Empty domain](empty%20domain.md)

{@{The definition above}@} requires that {@{the domain of discourse of any interpretation must be nonempty}@}. There are {@{settings, such as [inclusive logic](inclusive%20logic.md)}@}, where {@{empty domains are permitted}@}. Moreover, if {@{a class of algebraic structures includes an empty structure}@} \(for example, there is {@{an empty [poset](poset.md)}@}\), that class can {@{only be an elementary class in first-order logic}@} if {@{empty domains are permitted or the empty structure is removed from the class}@}.

There are {@{several difficulties with empty domains}@}, however:

- {@{Many common rules of inference}@} are {@{valid only when the domain of discourse is required to be nonempty}@}. One example is the rule stating that {@{$\varphi \lor \exists x\psi$ implies $\exists x(\varphi \lor \psi )$}@} when {@{_x_ is not a free variable in $\varphi$}@}. This rule, which is used to {@{put formulas into [prenex normal form](prenex%20normal%20form.md)}@}, is {@{sound in nonempty domains, but unsound if the empty domain is permitted}@}.
- {@{The definition of truth in an interpretation}@} that uses {@{a variable assignment function}@} {@{cannot work with empty domains}@}, because there are {@{no variable assignment functions whose range is empty}@}. \(Similarly, one cannot {@{assign interpretations to constant symbols}@}.\) {@{This truth definition}@} requires that {@{one must select a variable assignment function \(μ above\)}@} before {@{truth values for even atomic formulas can be defined}@}. Then {@{the truth value of a sentence}@} is {@{defined to be its truth value under any variable assignment}@}, and it is proved that {@{this truth value does not depend on which assignment is chosen}@}. {@{This technique}@} {@{does not work}@} if {@{there are no assignment functions at all}@}; it must be {@{changed to accommodate empty domains}@}.

Thus, when {@{the empty domain is permitted}@}, it must {@{often be treated as a special case}@}. {@{Most authors}@}, however, {@{simply exclude the empty domain by definition}@}.

{@{A _deductive system_}@} is used to {@{demonstrate, on a purely syntactic basis}@}, that {@{one formula is a logical consequence of another formula}@}. There are {@{many such systems for first-order logic}@}, including {@{[Hilbert-style deductive systems](Hilbert-style%20deductive%20system.md), [natural deduction](natural%20deduction.md)}@}, {@{the [sequent calculus](sequent%20calculus.md), the [tableaux method](method%20of%20analytic%20tableaux.md), and [resolution](resolution%20(logic).md)}@}. These share the common property that {@{a deduction is a finite syntactic object}@}; {@{the format of this object}@}, and {@{the way it is constructed}@}, {@{vary widely}@}. {@{These finite deductions themselves}@} are often called {@{_derivations_ in proof theory}@}. They are also often called {@{_proofs_}@} but are {@{completely formalized unlike natural-language [mathematical proofs](mathematical%20proofs.md)}@}.

{@{A deductive system is _sound_}@} if {@{any formula that can be derived in the system is logically valid}@}. Conversely, {@{a deductive system is _complete_}@} if {@{every logically valid formula is derivable}@}. {@{All of the systems discussed in this article}@} are {@{both sound and complete}@}. They also share the property that {@{it is possible to effectively verify}@} that {@{a purportedly valid deduction is actually a deduction}@}; such deduction systems are called {@{_effective_}@}.

{@{A key property of deductive systems}@} is that {@{they are purely syntactic}@}, so that {@{derivations can be verified without considering any interpretation}@}. Thus, {@{a sound argument}@} is {@{correct in every possible interpretation of the language}@}, regardless of {@{whether that interpretation is about mathematics, economics, or some other area}@}.

In general, {@{logical consequence in first-order logic}@} is {@{only [semidecidable](semidecidability.md#semidecidability)}@}: if {@{a sentence A logically implies a sentence B}@} then {@{this can be discovered}@} \(for example, by {@{searching for a proof until one is found}@}, using {@{some effective, sound, complete proof system}@}\). However, if {@{A does not logically imply B}@}, this does not mean that {@{A logically implies the negation of B}@}. There is {@{no effective procedure}@} that, given {@{formulas A and B}@}, {@{always correctly decides whether A logically implies B}@}.

### rules of inference

- Further information: ::@:: [List of rules of inference](list%20of%20rules%20of%20inference.md)

{@{A _[rule of inference](rule%20of%20inference.md)_}@} states that, given {@{a particular formula \(or set of formulas\) with a certain property}@} as {@{a hypothesis}@}, {@{another specific formula \(or set of formulas\)}@} can be {@{derived as a conclusion}@}. {@{The rule}@} is {@{sound \(or truth-preserving\)}@} if {@{it preserves validity}@} in the sense that {@{whenever any interpretation satisfies the hypothesis}@}, {@{that interpretation also satisfies the conclusion}@}.

For example, {@{one common rule of inference}@} is {@{the _rule of substitution_}@}. If {@{_t_ is a term}@} and {@{φ is a formula possibly containing the variable _x_}@}, then {@{φ\[_t_<!-- markdown separator -->/<!-- markdown separator -->_x_\]}@} is {@{the result of replacing all free instances of _x_ by _t_ in φ}@}. {@{The substitution rule}@} states that for {@{any φ and any term _t_}@}, one can {@{conclude φ\[_t_<!-- markdown separator -->/<!-- markdown separator -->_x_\] from φ}@} provided that {@{no free variable of _t_ becomes bound during the substitution process}@}. \(If {@{some free variable of _t_ becomes bound}@}, then to {@{substitute _t_ for _x_}@} it is first {@{necessary to change the bound variables of φ}@} to {@{differ from the free variables of _t_}@}.\)

To see {@{why the restriction on bound variables is necessary}@}, consider {@{the logically valid formula φ}@} given by {@{$\exists x(x=y)$}@}, in {@{the signature of \(0,1,+,×,=\) of arithmetic}@}. If {@{_t_ is the term "x + 1"}@}, {@{the formula φ\[_t_<!-- markdown separator -->/<!-- markdown separator -->_y_\] is $\exists x(x=x+1)$}@}, which {@{will be false in many interpretations}@}. The problem is that {@{the free variable _x_ of _t_}@} {@{became bound during the substitution}@}. {@{The intended replacement}@} can be obtained by {@{renaming the bound variable _x_ of φ to something else, say _z_}@}, so that {@{the formula after substitution is $\exists z(z=x+1)$}@}, which is {@{again logically valid}@}.

{@{The substitution rule}@} demonstrates {@{several common aspects of rules of inference}@}. It is {@{entirely syntactical}@}; one can tell {@{whether it was correctly applied without appeal to any interpretation}@}. It has {@{\(syntactically defined\) limitations on when it can be applied}@}, which must be {@{respected to preserve the correctness of derivations}@}. Moreover, as is {@{often the case}@}, {@{these limitations are necessary}@} because of {@{interactions between free and bound variables}@} that {@{occur during syntactic manipulations of the formulas involved in the inference rule}@}.

### Hilbert-style systems and natural deduction

{@{A deduction in a Hilbert-style deductive system}@} is {@{a list of formulas}@}, each of which is {@{a _logical axiom_}@}, a hypothesis that {@{has been assumed for the derivation at hand}@} or {@{follows from previous formulas via a rule of inference}@}. {@{The logical axioms}@} consist of {@{several [axiom schemas](axiom%20schema.md) of logically valid formulas}@}; these {@{encompass a significant amount of propositional logic}@}. {@{The rules of inference}@} {@{enable the manipulation of quantifiers}@}. {@{Typical Hilbert-style systems}@} have {@{a small number of rules of inference}@}, along with {@{several infinite schemas of logical axioms}@}. It is common to have {@{only [modus ponens](modus%20ponens.md) and [universal generalization](universal%20generalization.md) as rules of inference}@}.

{@{Natural deduction systems}@} {@{resemble Hilbert-style systems}@} in that {@{a deduction is a finite list of formulas}@}. However, {@{natural deduction systems have no logical axioms}@}; they {@{compensate by adding additional rules of inference}@} that can be used to {@{manipulate the logical connectives in formulas in the proof}@}.

### sequent calculus

- Further information: ::@:: [Sequent calculus](sequent%20calculus.md)

{@{The sequent calculus}@} was developed to {@{study the properties of natural deduction systems}@}.<sup>[\[25\]](#^ref-25)</sup> Instead of {@{working with one formula at a time}@}, it uses {@{_sequents_, which are expressions of the form}@}: {@{$$A_{1},\ldots ,A_{n}\vdash B_{1},\ldots ,B_{k},$$}@} where {@{A<sub>1</sub>, ..., A<sub>_n_</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, ..., B<sub>_k_</sub> are formulas}@} and {@{the turnstile symbol $\vdash$ is used as punctuation to separate the two halves}@}. Intuitively, {@{a sequent}@} expresses the idea that {@{$(A_{1}\land \cdots \land A_{n})$ implies $(B_{1}\lor \cdots \lor B_{k})$}@}.

### tableaux method

> {@{![A tableaux proof for the [propositional](propositional%20logic.md) formula \(\(a ∨ ¬b\) ∧ b\) → a](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Prop-tableau-4.svg)}@}
>
> {@{A tableaux proof}@} for {@{the [propositional](propositional%20logic.md) formula}@} {@{\(\(a ∨ ¬b\) ∧ b\) → a}@}

- Further information: [Method of analytic tableaux](method%20of%20analytic%20tableaux.md)

Unlike {@{the methods just described}@} {@{the derivations in the tableaux method}@} are {@{not lists of formulas}@}. Instead, {@{a derivation is a tree of formulas}@}. To show that {@{a formula A is provable}@}, the tableaux method attempts to {@{demonstrate that the negation of A is unsatisfiable}@}. {@{The tree of the derivation}@} has {@{$\lnot A$ at its root}@}; the tree {@{branches in a way}@} that {@{reflects the structure of the formula}@}. For example, to show that {@{$C\lor D$ is unsatisfiable}@} requires {@{showing that C and D are each unsatisfiable}@}; this corresponds to {@{a branching point in the tree}@} with {@{parent $C\lor D$ and children C and D}@}.

### resolution

- Main article: ::@:: [Resolution \(logic\)](resolution%20(logic).md)

{@{The [resolution rule](resolution%20(logic).md)}@} is {@{a single rule of inference that}@}, together with {@{[unification](unification%20(computing).md#definition%20of%20unification%20for%20first-order%20logic)}@}, is {@{sound and complete for first-order logic}@}. As with {@{the tableaux method}@}, {@{a formula is proved}@} by showing that {@{the negation of the formula is unsatisfiable}@}. Resolution is {@{commonly used in automated theorem proving}@}.

The resolution method {@{works only with formulas that are disjunctions of atomic formulas}@}; {@{arbitrary formulas}@} must first be {@{converted to this form through [Skolemization](Skolemization.md)}@}. The resolution rule states that from {@{the hypotheses $A_{1}\lor \cdots \lor A_{k}\lor C$ and $B_{1}\lor \cdots \lor B_{l}\lor \lnot C$}@}, {@{the conclusion $A_{1}\lor \cdots \lor A_{k}\lor B_{1}\lor \cdots \lor B_{l}$}@} can be obtained.

### provable identities

{@{Many identities can be proved}@}, which {@{establish equivalences between particular formulas}@}. These identities allow for {@{rearranging formulas by moving quantifiers across other connectives}@} and are useful for {@{putting formulas in [prenex normal form](prenex%20normal%20form.md)}@}. Some provable identities include:

- \(annotation: negate for all\) ::@:: $$\lnot \forall x\,P(x)\Leftrightarrow \exists x\,\lnot P(x)$$
- \(annotation: negate there exists\) ::@:: $$\lnot \exists x\,P(x)\Leftrightarrow \forall x\,\lnot P(x)$$
- \(annotation: swap for all\) ::@:: $$\forall x\,\forall y\,P(x,y)\Leftrightarrow \forall y\,\forall x\,P(x,y)$$
- \(annotation: swap there exists\) ::@:: $$\exists x\,\exists y\,P(x,y)\Leftrightarrow \exists y\,\exists x\,P(x,y)$$
- \(annotation: and for all\) ::@:: $$\forall x\,P(x)\land \forall x\,Q(x)\Leftrightarrow \forall x\,(P(x)\land Q(x))$$
- \(annotation: or there exists\) ::@:: $$\exists x\,P(x)\lor \exists x\,Q(x)\Leftrightarrow \exists x\,(P(x)\lor Q(x))$$
- \(annotation: move inside there exists; note the "or" case is already covered by above\) ::@:: $P\land \exists x\,Q(x)\Leftrightarrow \exists x\,(P\land Q(x))$ \(where $x$ must not occur free in $P$\)
- \(annotation: move inside for all; note the "and" case is already covered by above\) ::@:: $P\lor \forall x\,Q(x)\Leftrightarrow \forall x\,(P\lor Q(x))$ \(where $x$ must not occur free in $P$\)

## equality and its axioms

- See also: ::@:: [Equality \(mathematics\) § In logic](equality%20(mathematics).md#in%20logic)

There are {@{several different conventions}@} for {@{using equality \(or identity\) in first-order logic}@}. {@{The most common convention}@}, known as {@{__first-order logic with equality__}@}, includes {@{the equality symbol as a primitive logical symbol}@} which is {@{always interpreted as the real equality relation between members of the domain of discourse}@}, such that {@{the "two" given members are the same member}@}. This approach also {@{adds certain axioms about equality}@} to {@{the deductive system employed}@}. These equality axioms are:<sup>[\[26\]](#^ref-26)</sup><sup>:&hairsp;198–200&hairsp;</sup>

- _Reflexivity_. ::@:: For each variable _x_, _x_ = _x_.
- _Substitution for functions_. ::@:: For all variables _x_ and _y_, and any function symbol _f_, <p> _x_ = _y_ → _f_\(..., _x_, ...\) = _f_\(..., _y_, ...\).
- _Substitution for formulas_. ::@:: For any variables _x_ and _y_ and any formula φ\(_z_\) with a free variable z, then: <p> _x_ = _y_ → \(φ\(x\) → φ\(y\)\).

These are {@{[axiom schemas](axiom%20schema.md)}@}, each of which {@{specifies an infinite set of axioms}@}. {@{The third schema}@} is known as {@{_[Leibniz's law](identity%20of%20indiscernibles.md#indiscernibility%20of%20identicals)_}@}, {@{"the principle of substitutivity", "the indiscernibility of identicals", or "the replacement property"}@}. {@{The second schema}@}, involving {@{the function symbol _f_}@}, is {@{\(equivalent to\) a special case of the third schema}@}, using the formula: <p> {@{φ\(z\): _f_\(..., _x_, ...\) = _f_\(..., _z_, ...\)}@} <p> Then <p> {@{_x_ = _y_ → \(_f_\(..., _x_, ...\) = _f_\(..., _x_, ...\) → _f_\(..., _x_, ...\) = _f_\(..., _y_, ...\)\)}@}. <p> Since {@{_x_ = _y_ is given}@}, and {@{_f_\(..., _x_, ...\) = _f_\(..., _x_, ...\) true by reflexivity}@}, we have {@{_f_\(..., _x_, ...\) = _f_\(..., _y_, ...\)}@}

{@{Many other properties of equality}@} are {@{consequences of the axioms above}@}, for example:

- _Symmetry_. ::@:: If _x_ = _y_ then _y_ = _x_.<sup>[\[27\]](#^ref-27)</sup>
- _Transitivity_. ::@:: If _x_ = _y_ and _y_ = _z_ then _x_ = _z_.<sup>[\[28\]](#^ref-28)</sup>

### first-order logic without equality

{@{An alternate approach}@} considers {@{the equality relation to be a non-logical symbol}@}. This convention is known as {@{_first-order logic without equality_}@}. If {@{an equality relation is included in the signature}@}, {@{the axioms of equality}@} must now be {@{added to the theories under consideration, if desired}@}, instead of {@{being considered rules of logic}@}. {@{The main difference between this method and first-order logic with equality}@} is that {@{an interpretation may now interpret two distinct individuals as "equal"}@} \(although, by {@{Leibniz's law}@}, these will {@{satisfy exactly the same formulas under any interpretation}@}\). That is, {@{the equality relation}@} may now be {@{interpreted by an arbitrary [equivalence relation](equivalence%20relation.md) on the domain of discourse}@} that is {@{[congruent](congruence%20relation.md) with respect to the functions and relations of the interpretation}@}.

When {@{this second convention is followed}@}, {@{the term _normal model_}@} is used to {@{refer to an interpretation where no distinct individuals _a_ and _b_ satisfy _a_ = _b_}@}. In {@{first-order logic with equality}@}, {@{only normal models are considered}@}, and so there is {@{no term for a model other than a normal model}@}. When {@{first-order logic without equality is studied}@}, it is necessary to {@{amend the statements of results such as the [Löwenheim–Skolem theorem](Löwenheim–Skolem%20theorem.md)}@} so that {@{only normal models are considered}@}.

{@{First-order logic without equality}@} is often employed in {@{the context of [second-order arithmetic](second-order%20arithmetic.md) and other higher-order theories of arithmetic}@}, where {@{the equality relation between sets of natural numbers is usually omitted}@}.

### defining equality within a theory

If {@{a theory has a binary formula _A_\(_x_,_y_\)}@} which {@{satisfies reflexivity and Leibniz's law}@}, the theory is {@{said to have equality, or to be a theory with equality}@}. The theory may {@{not have all instances of the above schemas as axioms}@}, but rather as {@{derivable theorems}@}. For example, in {@{theories with no function symbols and a finite number of relations}@}, it is possible to {@{[define](definitional%20extension.md) equality in terms of the relations}@}, by {@{defining the two terms _s_ and _t_ to be equal}@} if {@{any relation is unchanged by changing _s_ to _t_ in any argument}@}.

Some theories allow {@{other _ad hoc_ definitions of equality}@}:

- In {@{the theory of [partial orders](partial%20order.md) with one relation symbol ≤}@}, one could {@{define _s_ = _t_}@} to be {@{an abbreviation for _s_ ≤ _t_ $\wedge$ _t_ ≤ _s_}@}.
- In {@{set theory with one relation ∈}@}, one may {@{define _s_ = _t_}@} to be {@{an abbreviation for ∀<!-- markdown separator -->_x_ \(_s_ ∈ _x_ ↔ _t_ ∈ _x_\) $\wedge$ ∀<!-- markdown separator -->_x_ \(_x_ ∈ _s_ ↔ _x_ ∈ _t_\)}@}. {@{This definition of equality}@} then {@{automatically satisfies the axioms for equality}@}. In this case, one should {@{replace the usual [axiom of extensionality](axiom%20of%20extensionality.md)}@}, which can be stated as {@{$\forall x\forall y[\forall z(z\in x\Leftrightarrow z\in y)\Rightarrow x=y]$}@}, with {@{an alternative formulation $\forall x\forall y[\forall z(z\in x\Leftrightarrow z\in y)\Rightarrow \forall z(x\in z\Leftrightarrow y\in z)]$}@}, which says that if {@{sets _x_ and _y_ have the same elements}@}, then {@{they also belong to the same sets}@}.

## metalogical properties

{@{One motivation for the use of first-order logic}@}, rather than {@{[higher-order logic](higher-order%20logic.md)}@}, is that {@{first-order logic has many [metalogical](metalogic.md) properties}@} that {@{stronger logics do not have}@}. These results concern {@{general properties of first-order logic itself}@}, rather than {@{properties of individual theories}@}. They provide {@{fundamental tools}@} for {@{the construction of models of first-order theories}@}.

### completeness and undecidability

{@{[Gödel's completeness theorem](Gödel's%20completeness%20theorem.md), proved by [Kurt Gödel](Kurt%20Gödel.md) in 1929}@}, establishes that there are {@{sound, complete, effective deductive systems for first-order logic}@}, and thus {@{the first-order logical consequence relation}@} is {@{captured by finite provability}@}. Naively, {@{the statement that a formula φ logically implies a formula ψ}@} depends on {@{every model of φ}@}; these models will {@{in general be of arbitrarily large cardinality}@}, and so {@{logical consequence cannot be effectively verified by checking every model}@}. However, it is possible to {@{enumerate all finite derivations}@} and {@{search for a derivation of ψ from φ}@}. If {@{ψ is logically implied by φ}@}, {@{such a derivation will eventually be found}@}. Thus {@{first-order logical consequence is [semidecidable](semidecidable.md)}@}: it is possible to {@{make an effective enumeration of all pairs of sentences \(φ,ψ\)}@} such that {@{ψ is a logical consequence of φ}@}.

Unlike {@{[propositional logic](propositional%20logic.md)}@}, first-order logic is {@{[undecidable](decidability%20(logic).md) \(although semidecidable\)}@}, provided that {@{the language has at least one predicate of arity at least 2 \(other than equality\)}@}. This means that there is {@{no [decision procedure](decision%20procedure.md) that determines whether arbitrary formulas are logically valid}@}. This result was established {@{independently by [Alonzo Church](Alonzo%20Church.md) and [Alan Turing](Alan%20Turing.md) in 1936 and 1937}@}, respectively, giving {@{a negative answer to the [Entscheidungsproblem](Entscheidungsproblem.md)}@} posed by {@{[David Hilbert](David%20Hilbert.md) and [Wilhelm Ackermann](Wilhelm%20Ackermann.md) in 1928}@}. Their proofs demonstrate {@{a connection between the unsolvability of the decision problem for first-order logic}@} and {@{the unsolvability of the [halting problem](halting%20problem.md)}@}.

There are {@{systems weaker than full first-order logic}@} for which {@{the logical consequence relation is decidable}@}. These include {@{propositional logic and [monadic predicate logic](monadic%20predicate%20logic.md)}@}, which is {@{first-order logic restricted to unary predicate symbols and no function symbols}@}. {@{Other logics with no function symbols which are decidable}@} are {@{the [guarded fragment](guarded%20fragment.md) of first-order logic, as well as [two-variable logic](two-variable%20logic.md)}@}. {@{The [Bernays–Schönfinkel class](Bernays–Schönfinkel%20class.md) of first-order formulas}@} is {@{also decidable}@}. {@{Decidable subsets of first-order logic}@} are also studied in {@{the framework of [description logics](description%20logics.md)}@}.

### The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem

{@{The [Löwenheim–Skolem theorem](Löwenheim–Skolem%20theorem.md)}@} shows that if {@{a first-order theory of [cardinality](cardinality.md) λ has an infinite model}@}, then it has {@{models of every infinite cardinality greater than or equal to λ}@}. One of {@{the earliest results in [model theory](model%20theory.md)}@}, it implies that it is {@{not possible to characterize [countability](countable%20set.md) or uncountability}@} in {@{a first-order language with a countable signature}@}. That is, there is {@{no first-order formula φ\(_x_\)}@} such that {@{an arbitrary structure M satisfies φ}@} {@{if and only if the domain of discourse of M is countable \(or, in the second case, uncountable\)}@}.

{@{The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies}@} that {@{infinite structures}@} {@{cannot be [categorically](categorical%20theory.md) axiomatized in first-order logic}@}. For example, there is {@{no first-order theory whose only model is the real line}@}: {@{any first-order theory with an infinite model}@} also has {@{a model of cardinality larger than the continuum}@}. Since {@{the real line is infinite}@}, {@{any theory satisfied by the real line}@} is also satisfied by {@{some [nonstandard models](nonstandard%20model.md)}@}. When {@{the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem is applied to first-order set theories}@}, {@{the nonintuitive consequences}@} are known as {@{[Skolem's paradox](Skolem's%20paradox.md)}@}.

### the compactness theorem

{@{The [compactness theorem](compactness%20theorem.md)}@} states that {@{a set of first-order sentences has a model}@} {@{if and only if every finite subset of it has a model}@}.<sup>[\[29\]](#^ref-29)</sup> This implies that if {@{a formula is a logical consequence of an infinite set of first-order axioms}@}, then {@{it is a logical consequence of some finite number of those axioms}@}. This theorem was proved first {@{by Kurt Gödel as a consequence of the completeness theorem}@}, but {@{many additional proofs have been obtained over time}@}. It is {@{a central tool in model theory}@}, providing {@{a fundamental method for constructing models}@}.

The compactness theorem has {@{a limiting effect}@} on {@{which collections of first-order structures are elementary classes}@}. For example, the compactness theorem implies that {@{any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models}@} has {@{an infinite model}@}. Thus, {@{the class of all finite [graphs](graph%20(discrete%20mathematics).md)}@} is {@{not an elementary class \(the same holds for many other algebraic structures\)}@}.

There are also {@{more subtle limitations of first-order logic}@} that are {@{implied by the compactness theorem}@}. For example, in {@{computer science}@}, many situations can be modeled as {@{a [directed graph](directed%20graph.md) of states \(nodes\) and connections \(directed edges\)}@}. {@{Validating such a system}@} may require {@{showing that no "bad" state can be reached from any "good" state}@}. Thus, one seeks to {@{determine if the good and bad states are in different [connected components](connected%20component%20(graph%20theory).md) of the graph}@}. However, the compactness theorem can be used to show that {@{connected graphs are not an elementary class in first-order logic}@}, and there is {@{no formula φ\(_x_,_y_\) of first-order logic, in the [logic of graphs](logic%20of%20graphs.md)}@}, that {@{expresses the idea that there is a path from _x_ to _y_}@}. {@{Connectedness}@} can be {@{expressed in [second-order logic](second-order%20logic.md)}@}, however, but {@{not with only existential set quantifiers}@}, as {@{$\Sigma _{1}^{1}$}@} also {@{enjoys compactness}@}.

### Lindström's theorem

- Main article: ::@:: [Lindström's theorem](Lindström's%20theorem.md)

{@{[Per Lindström](Per%20Lindström.md)}@} showed that {@{the metalogical properties just discussed}@} actually {@{characterize first-order logic in the sense that no stronger logic can also have those properties}@} \(Ebbinghaus and Flum 1994, Chapter XIII\). Lindström defined {@{a class of abstract logical systems}@}, and {@{a rigorous definition of the relative strength of a member of this class}@}. He established {@{two theorems for systems of this type}@}:

- {@{A logical system satisfying Lindström's definition}@} that {@{contains first-order logic and satisfies both the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem}@} must be {@{equivalent to first-order logic}@}.
- {@{A logical system satisfying Lindström's definition}@} that {@{has a semidecidable logical consequence relation and satisfies the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem}@} must be {@{equivalent to first-order logic}@}.

## limitations

Although {@{first-order logic is sufficient for formalizing much of mathematics}@} and is commonly used in {@{computer science and other fields}@}, it has {@{certain limitations}@}. These include limitations on {@{its expressiveness}@} and limitations of {@{the fragments of natural languages that it can describe}@}.

For instance, {@{first-order logic is undecidable}@}, meaning {@{a sound, complete and terminating decision algorithm for provability is impossible}@}. This has led to {@{the study of interesting decidable fragments}@}, such as {@{C<sub>2</sub>: first-order logic}@} with {@{two variables and the [counting quantifiers](counting%20quantifiers.md) $\exists ^{\geq n}$ and $\exists ^{\leq n}$}@}.<sup>[\[30\]](#^ref-30)</sup>

### expressiveness

{@{The [Löwenheim–Skolem theorem](Löwenheim–Skolem%20theorem.md)}@} shows that if {@{a first-order theory has any infinite model}@}, then it has {@{infinite models of every cardinality}@}. In particular, {@{no first-order theory with an infinite model}@} can be {@{[categorical](Morley's%20categoricity%20theorem.md)}@}. Thus, there is {@{no first-order theory whose only model has the set of natural numbers as its domain}@}, or whose {@{only model has the set of real numbers as its domain}@}. {@{Many extensions of first-order logic}@}, including {@{infinitary logics and higher-order logics}@}, are {@{more expressive}@} in the sense that {@{they do permit categorical axiomatizations of the natural numbers or real numbers}@}<sup>\[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please%20clarify)_\]</sup>. This expressiveness {@{comes at a metalogical cost}@}, however: by {@{[Lindström's theorem](Lindström's%20theorem.md)}@}, {@{the compactness theorem and the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem}@} {@{cannot hold in any logic stronger than first-order}@}.

### formalizing natural languages

- Main article: ::@:: [Logic translation § Natural language formalization](logic%20translation.md#natural%20language%20formalization)

First-order logic is able to {@{formalize many simple quantifier constructions in natural language}@}, such as {@{"every person who lives in Perth lives in Australia"}@}. Hence, first-order logic is used as {@{a basis for [knowledge representation languages](knowledge%20representation%20language.md)}@}, such as {@{[FO\(.\)](FO(.).md)}@}.

Still, there are {@{complicated features of natural language}@} that {@{cannot be expressed in first-order logic}@}. "{@{Any logical system which is appropriate}@} as {@{an instrument for the analysis of natural language}@} needs {@{a much richer structure than first-order predicate logic}@}".<sup>[\[31\]](#^ref-31)</sup>

## restrictions, extensions, and variations

There are {@{many variations of first-order logic}@}. Some of these are {@{inessential}@} in the sense that {@{they merely change notation without affecting the semantics}@}. Others {@{change the expressive power more significantly}@}, by {@{extending the semantics}@} through {@{additional quantifiers or other new logical symbols}@}. For example, {@{infinitary logics}@} permit {@{formulas of infinite size}@}, and {@{modal logics}@} add {@{symbols for possibility and necessity}@}.

### restricted languages

First-order logic can be studied in {@{languages with fewer logical symbols than were described above}@}:

- Because {@{$\exists x\varphi (x)$ can be expressed as $\neg \forall x\neg \varphi (x)$}@}, and {@{$\forall x\varphi (x)$ can be expressed as $\neg \exists x\neg \varphi (x)$}@}, {@{either of the two quantifiers $\exists$ and $\forall$}@} can be dropped.
- Since {@{$\varphi \lor \psi$ can be expressed as $\lnot (\lnot \varphi \land \lnot \psi )$}@} and {@{$\varphi \land \psi$ can be expressed as $\lnot (\lnot \varphi \lor \lnot \psi )$}@}, {@{either $\vee$ or $\wedge$}@} can be dropped. In other words, it is sufficient to {@{have $\neg$ and $\vee$, or $\neg$ and $\wedge$}@}, as {@{the only logical connectives}@}.
- Similarly, it is sufficient to have {@{only $\neg$ and $\rightarrow$ as logical connectives}@}, or to have {@{only the [Sheffer stroke](Sheffer%20stroke.md) \(NAND\) or the [Peirce arrow](Peirce%20arrow.md) \(NOR\) operator}@}.
- It is possible to {@{entirely avoid function symbols and constant symbols}@}, rewriting them via {@{predicate symbols in an appropriate way}@}. For example, instead of {@{using a constant symbol $\;0$}@} one may {@{use a predicate $\;0(x)$ \(interpreted as $\;x=0$ \)}@} and replace {@{every predicate such as $\;P(0,y)$}@} with {@{$\forall x\;(0(x)\rightarrow P(x,y))$}@}. {@{A function such as $f(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$}@} will similarly be replaced by {@{a predicate $F(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n},y)$ interpreted as $y=f(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$}@}. This change requires {@{adding additional axioms to the theory at hand}@}, so that {@{interpretations of the predicate symbols used have the correct semantics}@}.<sup>[\[32\]](#^ref-32)</sup>

{@{Restrictions such as these}@} are {@{useful as a technique}@} to {@{reduce the number of inference rules or axiom schemas in deductive systems}@}, which leads to {@{shorter proofs of metalogical results}@}. {@{The cost of the restrictions}@} is that it becomes {@{more difficult to express natural-language statements in the formal system at hand}@}, because {@{the logical connectives used in the natural language statements}@} must be {@{replaced by their \(longer\) definitions}@} in terms of {@{the restricted collection of logical connectives}@}. Similarly, {@{derivations in the limited systems}@} may be {@{longer than derivations in systems that include additional connectives}@}. There is thus {@{a trade-off between the ease of working within the formal system}@} and {@{the ease of proving results about the formal system}@}.

It is also possible to {@{restrict the arities of function symbols and predicate symbols}@}, in {@{sufficiently expressive theories}@}. One can in principle {@{dispense entirely with functions of arity greater than 2}@} and {@{predicates of arity greater than 1}@} in {@{theories that include a [pairing function](pairing%20function.md)}@}. This is {@{a function of arity 2 that takes pairs of elements of the domain}@} and {@{returns an [ordered pair](ordered%20pair.md) containing them}@}. It is also sufficient to {@{have two predicate symbols of arity 2}@} that {@{define projection functions from an ordered pair to its components}@}. In {@{either case}@} it is {@{necessary that the natural axioms for a pairing function and its projections}@} are {@{satisfied}@}.

### many-sorted logic

- Main article: ::@:: [Many-sorted logic](many-sorted%20logic.md)

{@{Ordinary first-order interpretations}@} have {@{a single domain of discourse over which all quantifiers range}@}. {@{_Many-sorted first-order logic_}@} allows {@{variables to have different _sorts_}@}, which {@{have different domains}@}. This is also called {@{_typed first-order logic_}@}, and the sorts called {@{_types_ \(as in [data type](data%20type.md)\)}@}, but it is not {@{the same as first-order [type theory](type%20theory.md)}@}. {@{Many-sorted first-order logic}@} is often used in {@{the study of [second-order arithmetic](second-order%20arithmetic.md)}@}.<sup>[\[33\]](#^ref-33)</sup>

When there are {@{only finitely many sorts in a theory}@}, {@{many-sorted first-order logic}@} can be {@{reduced to single-sorted first-order logic}@}.<sup>[\[34\]](#^ref-34)</sup><sup>:&hairsp;296–299&hairsp;</sup> One introduces {@{into the single-sorted theory a unary predicate symbol}@} for {@{each sort in the many-sorted theory}@} and adds {@{an axiom saying that these unary predicates partition the domain of discourse}@}. For example, if {@{there are two sorts}@}, one adds {@{predicate symbols $P_{1}(x)$ and $P_{2}(x)$}@} and the axiom: {@{$$\forall x(P_{1}(x)\lor P_{2}(x))\land \lnot \exists x(P_{1}(x)\land P_{2}(x)) \,.$$}@} Then {@{the elements satisfying $P_{1}$}@} are {@{thought of as elements of the first sort}@}, and {@{elements satisfying $P_{2}$ as elements of the second sort}@}. One can {@{quantify over each sort}@} by {@{using the corresponding predicate symbol to limit the range of quantification}@}. For example, to say {@{there is an element of the first sort satisfying formula $\varphi (x)$}@}, one writes: {@{$$\exists x(P_{1}(x)\land \varphi (x)) \,.$$}@}

### additional quantifiers

{@{Additional quantifiers}@} can be {@{added to first-order logic}@}.

- Sometimes it is useful to say that {@{"_P_\(_x_\) holds for exactly one _x_"}@}, which can be expressed as {@{∃!_x_ _P_\(_x_\)}@}. This notation, called {@{[uniqueness quantification](uniqueness%20quantification.md)}@}, may be taken to {@{abbreviate a formula}@} such as {@{∃<!-- markdown separator -->_x_ \(_P_\(_x_\) $\wedge$ ∀<!-- markdown separator -->_y_ \(_P_\(_y_\) → \(_x_ = _y_\)\)\)}@}.
- {@{_First-order logic with extra quantifiers_}@} has {@{new quantifiers _Qx_,...}@}, with {@{meanings such as "there are many _x_ such that ..."}@}. Also see {@{[branching quantifiers](branching%20quantifier.md) and the [plural quantifiers](plural%20quantification.md) of [George Boolos](George%20Boolos.md) and others}@}.
- {@{_[Bounded quantifiers](bounded%20quantifier.md)_}@} are often used in {@{the study of set theory or arithmetic}@}.

### infinitary logics

- Main article: ::@:: [Infinitary logic](infinitary%20logic.md)

{@{Infinitary logic}@} allows {@{infinitely long sentences}@}. For example, one may allow {@{a conjunction or disjunction of infinitely many formulas}@}, or {@{quantification over infinitely many variables}@}. {@{Infinitely long sentences}@} arise in {@{areas of mathematics including [topology](topology.md) and [model theory](model%20theory.md)}@}.

Infinitary logic generalizes {@{first-order logic to allow formulas of infinite length}@}. {@{The most common way in which formulas can become infinite}@} is through {@{infinite conjunctions and disjunctions}@}. However, it is also possible to {@{admit generalized signatures}@} in which {@{function and relation symbols are allowed to have infinite arities}@}, or in which {@{quantifiers can bind infinitely many variables}@}. Because {@{an infinite formula cannot be represented by a finite string}@}, it is {@{necessary to choose some other representation of formulas}@}; {@{the usual representation}@} in this context is {@{a tree}@}. Thus, formulas are, {@{essentially, identified with their parse trees}@}, rather than with {@{the strings being parsed}@}.

{@{The most commonly studied infinitary logics}@} are denoted {@{_L_<sub>αβ</sub>}@}, where {@{α and β are each either [cardinal numbers](cardinal%20number.md) or the symbol ∞}@}. In this notation, {@{ordinary first-order logic}@} is {@{_L_<sub>ωω</sub>}@}. In {@{the logic _L_<sub>∞ω</sub>}@}, {@{arbitrary conjunctions or disjunctions are allowed}@} when building formulas, and there is {@{an unlimited supply of variables}@}. More generally, {@{the logic that permits conjunctions or disjunctions with less than κ constituents}@} is known as {@{_L_<sub>κω</sub>}@}. For example, {@{_L_<sub>ω<sub>1</sub>ω</sub>}@} permits {@{[countable](countable%20set.md) conjunctions and disjunctions}@}.

{@{The set of free variables}@} in {@{a formula of _L_<sub>κω</sub>}@} can have {@{any cardinality strictly less than κ}@}, yet {@{only finitely many of them can be in the scope of any quantifier}@} when {@{a formula appears as a subformula of another}@}.<sup>[\[35\]](#^ref-35)</sup> In {@{other infinitary logics}@}, {@{a subformula may be in the scope of infinitely many quantifiers}@}. For example, in {@{_L_<sub>κ∞</sub>}@}, {@{a single universal or existential quantifier}@} may {@{bind arbitrarily many variables simultaneously}@}. Similarly, {@{the logic _L_<sub>κλ</sub>}@} permits {@{simultaneous quantification over fewer than λ variables}@}, as well as {@{conjunctions and disjunctions of size less than κ}@}.

### non-classical and modal logics

- Main article: ::@:: [Non-classical logic](non-classical%20logic.md)

- {@{_[Intuitionistic first-order logic](intuitionistic%20logic.md)_}@} uses {@{intuitionistic rather than classical reasoning}@}; for example, {@{¬¬φ}@} {@{need not be equivalent to φ}@} and {@{¬ ∀x.φ}@} is {@{in general not equivalent to ∃ x.¬φ}@} .
- {@{First-order _[modal logic](modal%20logic.md)_}@} allows one to {@{describe other possible worlds}@} as well as {@{this contingently true world which we inhabit}@}. In {@{some versions}@}, {@{the set of possible worlds}@} {@{varies depending on which possible world one inhabits}@}. {@{Modal logic}@} has {@{extra _modal operators_}@} with {@{meanings which can be characterized informally as}@}, for example {@{"it is necessary that φ"}@} \({@{true in all possible worlds}@}\) and {@{"it is possible that φ"}@} \({@{true in some possible world}@}\). With {@{standard first-order logic}@} we {@{have a single domain}@}, and {@{each predicate}@} is {@{assigned one extension}@}. With {@{first-order modal logic}@} we have {@{a _domain function_}@} that {@{assigns each possible world its own domain}@}, so that {@{each predicate}@} gets {@{an extension only relative to these possible worlds}@}. This allows us to {@{model cases}@} where, for example, {@{Alex is a philosopher}@}, but {@{might have been a mathematician}@}, and {@{might not have existed at all}@}. In {@{the first possible world}@} {@{_P_\(_a_\) is true}@}, in {@{the second _P_\(_a_\) is false}@}, and in {@{the third possible world there is no _a_ in the domain at all}@}.
- {@{_[First-order fuzzy logics](t-norm%20fuzzy%20logics.md)_}@} are {@{first-order extensions of propositional fuzzy logics}@} rather than {@{classical [propositional calculus](propositional%20calculus.md)}@}.

### fixpoint logic

- Main article: ::@:: [Fixed-point logic](fixed-point%20logic.md)

{@{Fixpoint logic}@} {@{extends first-order logic}@} by {@{adding the closure under the least fixed points of positive operators}@}.<sup>[\[36\]](#^ref-36)</sup>

### higher-order logics

- Main article: ::@:: [Higher-order logic](higher-order%20logic.md)

{@{The characteristic feature of first-order logic}@} is that {@{individuals can be quantified, but not predicates}@}. Thus {@{$$\exists a({\text{Phil} }(a))$$}@} is {@{a legal first-order formula}@}, but {@{$$\exists {\text{Phil} }({\text{Phil} }(a))$$}@} is {@{not}@}, in {@{most formalizations of first-order logic}@}. {@{[Second-order logic](second-order%20logic.md)}@} {@{extends first-order logic}@} by {@{adding the latter type of quantification}@}. {@{Other [higher-order logics](higher-order%20logic.md)}@} allow {@{quantification over even higher [types](type%20theory.md) than second-order logic permits}@}. These higher types include {@{relations between relations}@}, {@{functions from relations to relations between relations}@}, and {@{other higher-type objects}@}. Thus {@{the "first" in first-order logic}@} describes {@{the type of objects that can be quantified}@}.

Unlike {@{first-order logic}@}, for which {@{only one semantics is studied}@}, there are {@{several possible semantics for second-order logic}@}. {@{The most commonly employed semantics}@} for {@{second-order and higher-order logic}@} is known as {@{_full semantics_}@}. The combination of {@{additional quantifiers and the full semantics for these quantifiers}@} makes {@{higher-order logic stronger than first-order logic}@}. In particular, {@{the \(semantic\) logical consequence relation}@} for {@{second-order and higher-order logic}@} is {@{not semidecidable}@}; there is {@{no effective deduction system for second-order logic}@} that is {@{sound and complete under full semantics}@}.

{@{Second-order logic with full semantics}@} is {@{more expressive than first-order logic}@}. For example, it is possible to {@{create axiom systems in second-order logic}@} that {@{uniquely characterize the natural numbers and the real line}@}. {@{The cost of this expressiveness}@} is that second-order and higher-order logics have {@{fewer attractive metalogical properties than first-order logic}@}. For example, {@{the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and compactness theorem of first-order logic}@} become {@{false when generalized to higher-order logics with full semantics}@}.

## automated theorem proving and formal methods

- Further information: ::@:: [Automated theorem proving § First-order theorem proving](automated%20theorem%20proving.md#first-order%20theorem%20proving)

{@{[Automated theorem proving](automated%20theorem%20proving.md)}@} refers to {@{the development of computer programs}@} that {@{search and find derivations \(formal proofs\) of mathematical theorems}@}.<sup>[\[37\]](#^ref-37)</sup> {@{Finding derivations is a difficult task}@} because {@{the [search space](search%20algorithm.md) can be very large}@}; {@{an exhaustive search of every possible derivation}@} is {@{theoretically possible}@} but {@{[computationally infeasible](computational%20complexity%20theory.md) for many systems of interest in mathematics}@}. Thus {@{complicated [heuristic functions](heuristic%20function.md)}@} are developed to {@{attempt to find a derivation in less time than a blind search}@}.<sup>[\[38\]](#^ref-38)</sup>

The related area of {@{automated [proof verification](proof%20verification.md)}@} uses {@{computer programs to check that human-created proofs are correct}@}. Unlike {@{complicated automated theorem provers}@}, {@{verification systems}@} may be {@{small enough}@} that {@{their correctness can be checked both by hand and through automated software verification}@}. {@{This validation of the proof verifier}@} is {@{needed to give confidence}@} that {@{any derivation labeled as "correct" is actually correct}@}.

Some {@{proof verifiers}@}, such as {@{[Metamath](Metamath.md)}@}, insist on {@{having a complete derivation as input}@}. Others, such as {@{[Mizar](Mizar%20system.md) and [Isabelle](Isabelle%20(theorem%20prover).md)}@}, take {@{a well-formatted proof sketch}@} \(which may {@{still be very long and detailed}@}\) and {@{fill in the missing pieces}@} by {@{doing simple proof searches or applying known decision procedures}@}: {@{the resulting derivation}@} is then {@{verified by a small core "kernel"}@}. Many such systems are primarily {@{intended for interactive use by human mathematicians}@}: these are known as {@{[proof assistants](proof%20assistant.md)}@}. They may also use {@{formal logics that are stronger than first-order logic}@}, such as {@{type theory}@}. Because {@{a full derivation of any nontrivial result in a first-order deductive system}@} will be {@{extremely long for a human to write}@},<sup>[\[39\]](#^ref-39)</sup> results are often {@{formalized as a series of lemmas}@}, for which {@{derivations can be constructed separately}@}.

{@{Automated theorem provers}@} are also used to {@{implement [formal verification](formal%20verification.md) in computer science}@}. In this setting, {@{theorem provers}@} are used to {@{verify the correctness of programs and of hardware such as [processors](CPU.md)}@} with {@{respect to a [formal specification](formal%20specification.md)}@}. Because {@{such analysis is time-consuming and thus expensive}@}, it is usually {@{reserved for projects in which a malfunction would have grave human or financial consequences}@}.

For {@{the problem of [model checking](model%20checking.md)}@}, {@{efficient [algorithms](algorithm.md) are known}@} to {@{[decide](decision%20problem.md) whether an input finite structure satisfies a first-order formula}@}, in addition to {@{[computational complexity](computational%20complexity.md) bounds}@}: see {@{[Model checking § First-order logic](model%20checking.md#first-order%20logic)}@}.
