# ecliptic

The __ecliptic__ or __ecliptic plane__ is {@{the [orbital plane](orbital%20plane.md) of [Earth](Earth.md) around the [Sun](Sun.md)}@}. From {@{the perspective of an observer on Earth}@}, the [Sun](Sun.md)'s movement {@{[eastward](east.md) around the [celestial sphere](celestial%20sphere.md) over the course of a year traces out a path along the ecliptic against the background of stars}@}. <!--SR:!2027-05-09,783,330!2027-04-12,772,330!2025-12-11,351,290-->

The ecliptic forms {@{the center of the [zodiac](zodiac.md)}@}, {@{a celestial belt about 20Â° wide in [latitude](latitude.md) through which the [Sun](Sun.md), [Moon](Moon.md), and [planets](planet.md) always appear to move}@}, due to {@{their small [orbital inclinations](orbital%20inclination.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-08,313,336!2025-11-17,345,296!2027-04-21,787,336-->
