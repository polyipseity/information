# astronomical interferometer

An __astronomical interferometer__ or __telescope array__ is {@{a set of separate [telescopes](telescope.md), [mirror](mirror.md) segments, or [radio telescope](radio%20telescope.md) antennas that work together as a single telescope to provide higher resolution images of astronomical objects such as [stars](star.md), [nebulas](nebula.md) and [galaxies](galaxy.md) by means of [interferometry](interferometry.md)}@}. The advantage of this technique is that {@{it can theoretically produce images with the [angular resolution](angular%20resolution.md) of a huge telescope with an aperture equal to the separation, called ___baseline___, between the component telescopes}@}. The main drawback is that {@{it does not collect as much light as the hypothetical complete instrument}@}. Thus it is mainly useful for {@{fine resolution of more luminous astronomical objects, such as close [binary stars](binary%20star.md)}@}. Another drawback is that {@{the maximum [angular size](angular%20diameter.md) of a detectable emission source is limited by the minimum gap (baseline) between detectors in the collector array}@}. <!--SR:!2027-04-28,693,310!2027-08-24,845,330!2027-03-23,739,330!2028-04-06,1048,350!2025-07-28,235,270-->
