# Hertzsprung–Russell diagram

The __Hertzsprung–Russell diagram__ (abbreviated as __H–R diagram__, __HR diagram__ or __HRD__) is {@{a [scatter plot](scatter%20plot.md) of [stars](star.md) showing the relationship between the stars' [absolute magnitudes](absolute%20magnitude.md) or [luminosities](luminosity.md) and their [stellar classifications](stellar%20classification.md) or [effective temperatures](effective%20temperature.md)}@}. The diagram was created {@{independently in 1911 by [Ejnar Hertzsprung](Ejnar%20Hertzsprung.md) and by [Henry Norris Russell](Henry%20Norris%20Russell.md) in 1913}@}, and represented a major step towards {@{an understanding of [stellar evolution](stellar%20evolution.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-11-27,918,330!2028-06-12,843,250!2028-01-01,974,350-->

## forms of diagram

There are {@{several forms of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, and the [nomenclature](nomenclature.md) is not very well defined}@}. All forms share the same general layout: {@{[stars](star.md) of greater [luminosity](luminosity.md) are toward the top of the diagram, and stars with higher surface [temperature](temperature.md) are toward the left side of the diagram}@}. <!--SR:!2028-11-22,1229,350!2026-04-06,434,310-->

The original diagram displayed {@{the [spectral type](stellar%20classification.md#spectral%20type) of [stars](star.md) on the horizontal axis and the [absolute visual magnitude](absolute%20magnitude.md) on the vertical axis}@}. <!--SR:!2027-01-23,656,290-->

Another form of the diagram plots {@{the effective surface [temperature](temperature.md) of the [star](star.md) on one axis and the [luminosity](luminosity.md) of the star on the other}@}, almost invariably {@{in a [log–log plot](log–log%20plot.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-02,431,310!2026-09-09,592,330-->

## interpretation

Most of the [stars](star.md) occupy {@{the region in the diagram along the longest diagonal line called the [main sequence](main%20sequence.md)}@}. During the stage of their lives in which stars are found on the main sequence line, they are {@{[fusing hydrogen](proton–proton%20chain.md) in their cores}@}. <!--SR:!2029-01-23,1082,290!2027-04-24,764,330-->
