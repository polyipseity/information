__Gravitational waves__ are {@{waves of the intensity of [gravity](gravity.md)}@} that are generated by {@{the accelerated masses of [binary stars](binary%20star.md) and other motions of gravitating masses, and [propagate as waves](wave.md) outward from their source at the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-07-29,1415,350!2027-09-03,854,330-->
