## mathematics

### discounted cash flows

{@{The discounted cash flow formula}@} is derived from {@{the [present value formula for calculating the time value of money](time%20value%20of%20money.md#present%20value%20of%20a%20future%20sum)}@} {@{$$DCF={\frac {CF_{1} }{(1+r)^{1} } }+{\frac {CF_{2} }{(1+r)^{2} } }+\dotsb +{\frac {CF_{n} }{(1+r)^{n} } }$$}@} and {@{[compounding](compound%20interest.md) returns}@}: {@{$$FV=DCF\cdot (1+r)^{n} \,.$$}@} Thus {@{the discounted present value \(for one cash flow in one future period\)}@} is expressed as: {@{$$DPV={\frac {FV}{(1+r)^{n} } }$$}@} where <!--SR:!2026-01-03,257,330!2026-02-10,287,330!2025-09-21,173,310!2025-09-13,166,310!2026-05-05,351,349!2026-01-16,268,330!2026-04-09,337,349-->

- _DPV_ ::@:: is the discounted present value of the future cash flow \(_FV_\), or _FV_ adjusted for the delay in receipt; <!--SR:!2026-02-13,290,330!2025-12-29,254,330-->
- _FV_ ::@:: is the [nominal value](real%20versus%20nominal%20value%20(economics).md) of a cash flow amount in a future period \(see [Mid-year adjustment](mid-year%20adjustment.md#determine%20current%20value)\); <!--SR:!2025-12-21,247,330!2026-01-05,259,330-->
- _r_ ::@:: is the [interest rate](interest%20rate.md) or discount rate, which reflects the cost of tying up [capital](capital%20(economics).md) and may also allow for the risk that the payment may not be received in full;<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-04-10,338,349!2025-10-24,185,310-->
- _n_ ::@:: is the time in years before the future cash flow occurs. <!--SR:!2026-01-10,263,330!2026-01-25,275,330-->

Where {@{multiple cash flows in multiple time periods are discounted}@}, it is necessary to {@{sum them as follows: $$DPV=\sum _{t=0}^{N}{\frac {FV_{t} }{(1+r)^{t} } }$$}@} for {@{each future cash flow \(_FV_\) at any time period \(_t_\) in years from the present time, summed over all time periods}@}. The sum can then be used as {@{a [net present value](net%20present%20value.md) figure}@}. If {@{the amount to be paid at time 0 \(now\) for all the future cash flows is known}@}, then {@{that amount can be substituted for _DPV_}@} and the equation can be {@{solved for _r_, that is the [internal rate of return](internal%20rate%20of%20return.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-14,190,310!2025-12-11,238,330!2025-12-24,250,330!2026-01-07,260,330!2026-04-08,336,349!2026-02-09,286,330!2025-12-13,240,330-->

{@{All the above}@} assumes that {@{the interest rate remains constant throughout the whole period}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-16,292,330!2026-02-09,286,330-->

If {@{the cash flow stream is assumed to continue indefinitely}@}, {@{the finite forecast}@} is usually {@{combined with the assumption of constant cash flow growth beyond the discrete projection period}@}. {@{The total value of such cash flow stream}@} is {@{the sum of the finite discounted cash flow forecast and the [Terminal value \(finance\)](terminal%20value%20(finance).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-14,341,349!2026-01-02,256,330!2025-10-19,191,310!2026-04-04,333,349!2026-03-29,327,349-->

### continuous cash flows

For {@{continuous cash flows}@}, {@{the summation in the above formula is replaced by an integration}@}: {@{$$DPV=\int _{0}^{T}FV(t)\,e^{-\lambda t}dt=\int _{0}^{T}{\frac {FV(t)}{(1+r)^{t} } }\,dt\,,$$}@} where {@{$FV(t)$ is now the _rate_ of cash flow, and $\lambda =\ln(1+r)$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-31,329,349!2025-12-25,251,330!2026-02-03,260,290!2026-08-20,419,310-->

## discount rate

{@{The act of discounting future cash flows}@} asks "{@{how much money would have to be invested currently, at a given rate of return}@}, to {@{yield the forecast cash flow, at its future date}@}?" In other words, discounting returns {@{the [present value](present%20value.md) of future cash flows}@}, where the rate used is {@{the cost of capital that _appropriately_ reflects the risk, and timing, of the cash flows}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-27,343,349!2026-01-25,275,330!2026-01-04,258,330!2026-02-02,279,330!2025-12-17,244,330-->

This "__required return__" thus incorporates: (annotation: they are {@{time value of money, risk premium}@}) <!--SR:!2026-01-09,262,330-->

1. [Time value of money](time%20value%20of%20money.md) \([risk-free rate](risk-free%20interest%20rate.md)\) โ ::@:: according to the theory of [time preference](time%20preference.md), investors would rather have cash immediately than having to wait and must therefore be compensated by paying for the delay. <!--SR:!2025-09-05,160,310!2026-01-21,272,330-->
2. [Risk premium](risk%20premium.md) โ ::@:: reflects the extra return investors demand because they want to be compensated for the risk that the cash flow might not materialize after all. <!--SR:!2025-10-16,192,310!2026-04-05,334,349-->

For {@{the latter}@}, {@{various [models](economic%20model.md) have been developed}@}, where the premium is \(typically\) calculated as {@{a function of the asset's performance with reference to some macroeconomic variable}@} โ for example, {@{the CAPM}@} compares {@{the asset's historical returns to the "[overall market's](market%20portfolio.md)"}@}; see [Capital asset pricing model ยง Asset-specific required return](capital%20asset%20pricing%20model.md#asset-specific%20required%20return) and [Asset pricing ยง General equilibrium asset pricing](asset%20pricing.md#general%20equilibrium%20asset%20pricing). <!--SR:!2026-02-18,294,330!2026-01-16,268,330!2026-02-03,280,330!2026-02-06,283,330!2026-05-06,352,349-->

{@{An alternate, although less common approach}@}, is to {@{apply a "fundamental valuation" method}@}, such as {@{the "[T-model](T-model.md)"}@}, which instead {@{relies on accounting information}@}. {@{Other methods of discounting}@}, such as {@{[hyperbolic discounting](hyperbolic%20discounting.md)}@}, are {@{studied in academia and said to reflect intuitive decision-making, but are not generally used in industry}@}. In this context the above is referred to as "{@{exponential discounting}@}". <!--SR:!2026-02-01,278,330!2026-02-15,291,330!2025-09-10,164,310!2026-02-13,290,330!2026-02-07,284,330!2026-01-10,263,330!2025-12-15,242,330!2026-05-06,352,349-->

The terminology "{@{[expected return](expected%20return.md)}@}", although formally {@{the [mathematical expected value](expected%20value.md)}@}, is often {@{used interchangeably with the above}@}, where {@{"expected" means "required" or "demanded" by investors}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-11,288,330!2026-04-11,338,349!2025-12-08,237,330!2026-01-31,277,330-->

The method may {@{also be modified by industry}@}, for example various formulae have been proposed when {@{choosing a discount rate [in a healthcare setting](healthcare%20economics.md);<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> similarly in a [mining setting](valuation%20(finance).md#valuation%20of%20mining%20projects)}@}, where {@{risk-characteristics can differ \(dramatically\) by [property](mineral%20rights.md)}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-25,275,330!2026-05-06,352,349!2026-01-12,264,330-->

## methods of appraisal of a company or project

For {@{these [valuation](valuation%20(finance).md) purposes}@}, {@{a number of different DCF methods}@} are {@{distinguished today, some of which are outlined below}@}. The details are likely to vary depending on {@{the [capital structure](capital%20structure.md) of the company}@}. However {@{the assumptions used in the appraisal}@} \(especially {@{the equity discount rate and the [projection of the cash flows](cash%20flow%20forecast.md) to be achieved}@}\) are likely to be {@{at least as important as the precise model used}@}. Both {@{the income stream selected and the associated [cost of capital](cost%20of%20capital.md) model}@} determine {@{the valuation result obtained with each method}@}. \(This is one reason these valuation methods are formally referred to as {@{the Discounted Future Economic Income methods}@}.\) The below is offered as a high-level treatment; for the components / steps of business modeling here, see [Outline of finance ยง Financial modeling](outline%20of%20finance.md#financial%20modeling). <!--SR:!2026-04-12,339,349!2025-12-16,243,330!2026-02-03,280,330!2026-02-06,283,330!2026-05-05,351,349!2025-10-12,188,310!2026-04-16,343,349!2026-02-11,288,330!2026-01-19,270,330!2026-02-10,287,330-->

### equity-approach

- [Flows to equity](flows%20to%20equity.md) approach \(FTE\)
  - (annotation: flows to equity) ::@:: Discount the cash flows available to the holders of equity capital, after allowing for cost of servicing debt capital <!--SR:!2027-05-03,623,330!2026-12-29,519,310-->

  - (annotation: flows to equity) Disadvantages: ::@:: Requires judgement on choice of discount rate <!--SR:!2025-11-22,224,329!2027-05-12,632,330-->

### entity-approach

- [Adjusted present value](adjusted%20present%20value.md) approach \(APV\)
  - (annotation: adjusted present value) ::@:: Discount the cash flows before allowing for the debt capital \(but allowing for the tax relief obtained on the debt capital\) <!--SR:!2026-11-11,483,310!2026-06-20,374,309-->
  - (annotation: adjusted present value) Advantages: ::@:: Simpler to apply if a specific project is being valued which does not have earmarked debt capital finance <!--SR:!2025-09-24,173,310!2025-10-06,184,310-->
  - (annotation: adjusted present value) Disadvantages: ::@:: Requires judgement on choice of discount rate; no explicit allowance for cost of debt capital, which may be much higher than a [risk-free rate](risk-free%20rate.md) <!--SR:!2025-12-28,235,329!2026-02-12,269,290-->
- [Weighted average cost of capital](weighted%20average%20cost%20of%20capital.md) approach \(WACC\)
  - (annotation: weighted average cost of capital) ::@:: Derive a weighted cost of the capital obtained from the various sources and use that discount rate to discount the unlevered free cash flows from the project <!--SR:!2025-11-07,191,270!2026-09-23,445,310-->
  - (annotation: weighted average cost of capital) Advantages: ::@:: Overcomes the requirement for debt capital finance to be earmarked to particular projects <!--SR:!2026-08-01,406,310!2026-04-16,343,349-->
  - (annotation: weighted average cost of capital) Disadvantages: ::@:: Care must be exercised in the selection of the appropriate income stream. The net cash flow to total invested capital is the generally accepted choice. <!--SR:!2025-12-06,236,329!2025-10-20,192,310-->
- [Total cash flow](total%20cash%20flow.md) approach \(TCF\)<sup>\[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please%20clarify)_\]</sup> (TODO: clarification needed)
  - This distinction illustrates that the Discounted Cash Flow method can be used to determine the value of various business ownership interests. These can include equity or debt holders.
  - Alternatively, the method can be used to value the company based on the value of total invested capital. In each case, the differences lie in the choice of the income stream and discount rate. For example, the net cash flow to total invested capital and WACC are appropriate when valuing a company based on the market value of all invested capital.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup>

## shortcomings

{@{The following difficulties}@} are identified with {@{the application of DCF in valuation}@}: (annotation: they are {@{forecast reliability, discount rate estimation, inputโoutput problem, missing variables}@}) <!--SR:!2025-12-07,236,330!2026-01-02,256,330!2026-10-27,472,310-->

1. {@{__Forecast reliability__}@}: {@{Traditional DCF models}@} assume {@{we can accurately forecast revenue and earnings 3โ5 years into the future}@}. But studies have shown that {@{growth is neither predictable nor persistent}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> \(See [Stock valuation\#Growth rate](stock%20valuation.md#growth%20rate) and [Sustainable growth rate\#From a financial perspective](sustainable%20growth%20rate.md#from%20a%20financial%20perspective).\) In other terms, using DCF models is {@{problematic due to the [problem of induction](problem%20of%20induction.md)}@}, i.e. {@{presupposing that a sequence of events in the future will occur as it always has in the past}@}. Colloquially, in the world of finance, the problem of induction is often {@{simplified with the common phrase}@}: {@{past returns are not indicative of future results}@}. In fact, the SEC {@{demands that all mutual funds use this sentence to warn their investors}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> <p> This observation has led some to conclude that {@{DCF models should only be used to value companies with steady cash flows}@}. For example, DCF models are widely used to {@{value mature companies in stable industry sectors, such as utilities}@}. For {@{industries that are especially unpredictable and thus harder to forecast}@}, DCF models can {@{prove especially challenging}@}. Industry Examples:
    - {@{Real Estate}@}: Investors use {@{DCF models [to value commercial real estate development projects](real%20estate%20appraisal.md#the%20income%20approach)}@}. This practice has {@{two main shortcomings}@}. First, {@{the discount rate assumption}@} relies on {@{the market for competing investments at the time of the analysis, which may not persist into the future}@}. Second, {@{assumptions about ten-year income increases}@} are usually {@{based on historic increases in the market rent}@}. Yet {@{the cyclical nature of most real estate markets is not factored in}@}. {@{Most real estate loans are made during boom real estate markets}@} and {@{these markets usually last fewer than ten years}@}. In this case, due to {@{the problem of induction}@}, using a DCF model to {@{value commercial real estate during any but the early years of a boom market}@} can {@{lead to overvaluation}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup>
    - {@{Early-stage Technology Companies}@}: {@{[In valuing startups](startup%20company.md#valuations)}@}, the DCF method can be {@{applied a number of times, with differing assumptions}@}, to {@{assess a range of possible future outcomesโsuch as the best, worst and mostly likely case scenarios}@}. Even so, {@{the lack of historical company data and uncertainty about factors that can affect the company's development}@} make {@{DCF models especially difficult for valuing startups}@}. There is {@{a lack of credibility}@} regarding {@{future cash flows, future cost of capital, and the company's growth rate}@}. By {@{forecasting limited data into an unpredictable future}@}, {@{the problem of induction}@} is especially pronounced.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup>
2. {@{__Discount rate estimation__}@}: Traditionally, DCF models assume that {@{the [capital asset pricing model](capital%20asset%20pricing%20model.md) can be used to assess the riskiness of an investment and set an appropriate discount rate}@}. Some economists, however, suggest that {@{the capital asset pricing model has been empirically invalidated}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> {@{Various other models}@} are proposed \(see [asset pricing](asset%20pricing.md)\), although {@{all are subject to some theoretical or empirical criticism}@}.
3. {@{__Input-output problem__}@}: DCF is {@{merely a mechanical valuation tool}@}, which makes it {@{subject to the principle "[garbage in, garbage out](garbage%20in,%20garbage%20out.md)"}@}. {@{Small changes in inputs}@} can {@{result in large changes in the value of a company}@}. This is especially the case with {@{[terminal values](terminal%20value%20(finance).md), which make up a large proportion of the Discounted Cash Flow's final value}@}.
4. {@{__Missing variables__}@}: {@{Traditional DCF calculations}@} {@{only consider the financial costs and benefits of a decision}@}. They do not {@{include the environmental, social and governance performance of an organization}@}.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> This criticism, true {@{for all valuation techniques}@}, is addressed through {@{an approach called "IntFV" discussed below}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-12,289,330!2026-01-18,269,330!2026-03-20,318,349!2026-02-01,278,330!2026-01-19,270,330!2025-11-11,214,329!2026-01-05,259,330!2025-12-14,241,330!2025-12-29,254,330!2026-01-31,277,330!2025-12-27,252,330!2026-02-07,284,330!2026-05-06,352,349!2026-02-17,293,330!2026-01-20,271,330!2026-05-05,351,349!2026-04-04,333,349!2025-11-23,224,329!2026-03-21,319,349!2027-02-27,552,310!2026-01-24,274,330!2026-02-08,285,330!2026-02-15,291,330!2026-01-13,265,330!2026-01-26,276,330!2026-01-18,269,330!2026-04-06,334,349!2025-12-29,236,329!2025-12-18,226,329!2025-10-15,191,310!2025-08-28,154,310!2026-01-03,257,330!2025-11-18,217,329!2025-09-28,166,310!2026-02-06,283,330!2026-02-02,279,330!2026-05-05,351,349!2026-02-08,285,330!2025-12-14,241,330!2025-10-15,180,310!2025-12-12,239,330!2026-01-04,258,330!2026-02-07,284,330!2026-01-24,274,330!2026-01-08,261,330!2025-09-27,165,310!2026-02-04,281,330!2026-04-07,335,349!2025-10-09,174,310!2026-01-14,266,330!2026-02-12,289,330!2026-01-13,265,330!2026-03-26,324,349-->

## integrated future value

To {@{address the lack of integration of the short and long term importance}@}, {@{value and risks associated with natural and social capital into the traditional DCF calculation}@}, companies are {@{valuing their environmental, social and governance \(ESG\) performance}@} through {@{an [Integrated Management](integrated%20management.md) approach to reporting}@}, that {@{expands DCF or Net Present Value to Integrated Future Value \(IntFV\)}@}.<sup>[\[16\]](#^ref-16)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-04-15,342,349!2025-12-05,235,329!2026-01-08,261,330!2025-12-16,243,330!2025-09-16,169,310-->

This allows companies to {@{value their investments not just for their financial return}@} but also {@{the long term environmental and social return of their investments}@}. By {@{highlighting environmental, social and governance performance in reporting}@}, decision makers have the opportunity to {@{identify new areas for value creation that are not revealed through traditional financial reporting}@}. As an example, {@{the [social cost of carbon](social%20cost%20of%20carbon.md)}@} is {@{one value that can be incorporated into Integrated Future Value calculations}@} to {@{encompass the damage to society from greenhouse gas emissions that result from an investment}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-14,266,330!2026-04-30,346,349!2026-03-30,328,349!2027-05-11,630,330!2026-05-01,347,349!2026-04-03,332,349!2027-05-08,628,330-->

This is {@{an integrated approach to reporting that supports Integrated Bottom Line \(IBL\) decision making}@}, which takes {@{[triple bottom line](triple%20bottom%20line.md) \(TBL\) a step further}@} and combines {@{financial, environmental and social performance reporting into one balance sheet}@}. This approach provides decision makers with the insight to {@{identify opportunities for value creation that promote growth and change within an organization}@}. <sup>[\[17\]](#^ref-17)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-26,276,330!2025-12-30,255,330!2026-04-26,342,349!2026-01-15,267,330-->
