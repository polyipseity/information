In [economics](economics.md), __inferior goods__ are {@{those goods the demand for which falls with increase in income of the consumer}@}. So, there is {@{an inverse relationship between income of the consumer and the demand for inferior goods}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> There are {@{many examples of inferior goods}@}, including {@{cheap cars, public transit options, [payday lending](payday%20loan.md), and inexpensive food}@}. {@{The shift in consumer demand for an inferior good}@} can be explained by {@{two natural economic phenomena}@}: {@{the [substitution effect](substitution%20effect.md) and the income effect}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-22,258,330!2025-10-10,249,330!2025-11-30,289,330!2026-04-29,357,310!2025-11-10,273,330!2025-09-27,238,330!2027-12-09,837,330-->

> {@{[Engels curves](Engel%20curve.md)}@} showing {@{[income elasticity of demand](income%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md) \(YED\)}@} of {@{[normal goods](normal%20good.md) \(comprising [luxury](luxury%20goods.md) \(red\) and [necessity goods](necessity%20good.md) \(yellow\)\), [perfectly inelastic](elasticity%20(economics).md) \(green\) and __inferior goods__ \(blue\)}@} <!--SR:!2027-12-24,849,330!2025-10-05,245,330!2025-12-03,291,330!2025-12-04,292,330-->

In [economics](economics.md), inferior goods are {@{goods whose demand decreases when consumer income rises \(or demand increases when consumer income decreases\)}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> This behaviour is unlike {@{the [supply and demand](supply%20and%20demand.md) behaviour of [normal goods](normal%20good.md)}@}, for which {@{the opposite is observed}@};<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> normal goods are {@{those goods for which the demand rises as consumer income rises}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup><sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2027-05-25,698,330!2025-12-06,294,330!2025-10-10,248,330!2028-07-31,1047,350-->

{@{Inferiority}@}, in this sense, is {@{an observable fact relating to affordability}@} rather than {@{a statement about the quality of the good}@}. As a rule, these goods are {@{affordable and adequately fulfil their purpose}@}, but {@{as more costly substitutes that offer more utility become available, the use of the inferior goods diminishes}@}. Direct relations can thus be {@{drawn from inferior goods to socio-economic class}@}. {@{Those with constricted incomes}@} tend to {@{prefer inferior goods for the reason of the aforementioned observable inferiority}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-07-15,1034,350!2025-11-28,287,330!2025-12-04,292,330!2025-10-26,261,330!2025-11-08,272,330!2025-12-05,293,330!2025-11-02,267,330!2026-02-01,311,290-->

Depending on {@{consumer or market [indifference curves](indifference%20curve.md)}@}, the amount of a good bought can {@{either increase, decrease, or stay the same when income increases}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-08-28,1069,350!2025-11-26,285,330-->

## examples

There are {@{many examples of inferior goods}@}. A number of economists have suggested that {@{shopping at large discount chains such as Walmart and [rent-to-own](rent-to-own.md) establishments}@} vastly {@{represent a large percentage of goods referred to as "inferior"}@}. {@{Cheaper cars}@} are examples of the inferior goods. Consumers will generally {@{prefer cheaper cars when their income is constricted}@}. As {@{a consumer's income increases}@}, {@{the demand for the cheap cars will decrease}@}, while {@{demand for costly cars will increase}@}, so {@{cheap cars are inferior goods}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-23,259,330!2026-11-03,521,310!2025-12-06,294,330!2025-10-18,255,330!2028-07-16,1035,350!2025-10-05,245,330!2025-11-26,285,330!2025-10-12,251,330!2025-11-05,269,330-->

{@{Inter-city [bus](bus.md) service}@} is also an example of an inferior good. This form of transportation is {@{cheaper than [air](air%20travel.md) or [rail](rail%20transport.md) travel, but is more time-consuming}@}. When {@{money is constricted, traveling by bus becomes more acceptable}@}, but when {@{money is more abundant than time, more rapid transport is preferred}@}. In {@{some countries with less developed or poorly maintained railways}@} this is reversed: {@{trains are slower and cheaper than buses}@}, so {@{rail travel is an inferior good}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-31,265,330!2025-10-12,251,330!2025-11-11,274,330!2027-10-17,807,330!2027-09-24,793,330!2025-11-12,275,330!2027-12-14,841,330-->

{@{Certain financial services, including [payday lending](payday%20loan.md)}@}, are inferior goods. Such financial services are {@{generally marketed to persons with low incomes}@}. {@{People with middle or higher incomes}@} can {@{typically use credit cards that have better terms of payment or bank loans for higher volumes and much lower rates of interest}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-11,274,330!2025-10-27,262,330!2025-11-13,276,330!2025-12-01,290,330-->

{@{Inexpensive foods}@} like {@{[instant noodles](instant%20noodles.md), [bologna](bologna%20sausage.md), [pizza](pizza.md), [hamburger](hamburger.md), mass-market [beer](beer.md), [frozen dinners](frozen%20meal.md), and [canned goods](canning.md)}@} are additional examples of inferior goods. As {@{incomes rise}@}, one tends to {@{purchase more expensive, appealing or nutritious foods}@}. Likewise, {@{goods and services used by poor people for which richer people have alternatives}@} exemplify inferior goods. As a rule, {@{used and obsolete goods \(but not [antiques](antique.md)\)}@} marketed to {@{persons of low income as [closeouts](closeout%20(sale).md)}@} are {@{inferior goods at the time even if they had earlier been normal goods or even luxury goods}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-28,287,330!2027-01-17,540,290!2025-11-10,273,330!2025-10-12,250,330!2025-11-27,286,330!2025-11-11,274,330!2025-10-04,244,330!2025-10-11,250,330-->

Others are {@{very inconsistent across geographic regions or cultures}@}. {@{The [potato](potato.md)}@}, for example, generally conforms to {@{the demand function of an inferior good in the Andean region where the crop originated}@}. {@{People of higher incomes and/or those who have migrated to coastal areas}@} are {@{more likely to prefer other staples such as rice or wheat products as they can afford them}@}. However, in {@{several countries of Asia, such as [Bangladesh](Bangladesh.md)}@}, potatoes are {@{not an inferior good, but rather a relatively expensive source of calories and a high-prestige food}@}, especially when {@{eaten in the form of [French fries](French%20fries.md) by urban elites}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-03,243,330!2025-11-29,288,330!2026-01-29,311,290!2025-10-21,257,330!2027-04-22,604,310!2025-10-30,264,330!2026-09-21,487,310!2027-09-08,768,330-->

## income and substitution effects

> ![generic Australian beer nuts](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Home%20brand%20beer%20nuts.jpg)
>
> An item such as {@{non-branded grocery products}@} are common inferior goods. There is {@{no set criteria of what constitutes an inferior good}@}, but economists refer to an inferior good as {@{any item preferred less when disposable consumer income increases}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-28,263,330!2025-10-09,247,330!2025-09-26,237,330-->

{@{The shift in consumer demand for an inferior good}@} can be explained by {@{two natural economic phenomena}@}: {@{The substitution effect and the income effect}@}. These effects {@{describe and validate the movement of the demand curve}@} {@{in \(independent\) response to increasing income and relative cost of other goods}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-09-25,236,330!2025-12-01,290,330!2025-11-12,275,330!2025-10-18,255,330!2025-12-06,294,330-->

### income effect

The income effect describes {@{the relationship between an increase in real income and demand for a good}@}. Inferior goods {@{experience negative income effect}@}, where {@{its consumption decreases when a consumer's income increases}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> {@{The increase in real income}@} means {@{consumers can afford a bundle of goods that give them higher utility}@}. Inferior goods are {@{unlikely to provide the latter, thus why its consumption decreases}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-23,763,330!2025-10-06,246,330!2026-10-24,512,310!2027-08-27,767,330!2025-10-17,254,330!2026-10-30,518,310-->

### substitution effect

The substitution effect is {@{the effect that a change in relative prices of substitute goods has on the quantity demanded}@}. It is due to {@{a change in relative prices between two or more substitute goods}@}. When {@{the price of a commodity falls and prices of its substitutes remain unchanged}@}, it becomes {@{relatively cheaper in comparison to its substitutes}@}. In other words, {@{its substitutes become relatively costlier}@}. Consumers would {@{normally like to substitute cheaper goods for costlier ones}@}. Thus, {@{the demand for relatively cheaper substitute commodities increases}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> Compared to {@{normal goods}@}, {@{a price decrease \(or increase\) would actually decrease \(or increase\) the consumption of an inferior good}@}. This is only possible if {@{negative income effect is strong or large enough to outweigh the substitution effect}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-11,249,330!2025-11-10,273,330!2025-12-05,293,330!2025-12-02,290,330!2025-11-30,289,330!2025-10-08,247,330!2025-10-06,246,330!2028-08-29,1071,350!2026-10-28,515,310!2025-12-02,290,330-->

### overall change in demand for an inferior good

{@{The income and substitution effects}@} work {@{in opposite directions for an inferior good}@}. When {@{an inferior good's price decreases}@}, {@{the income effect reduces the quantity consumed}@}, whilst {@{the substitution effect increases the amount consumed}@}. In practice, it has been observed that {@{the substitution effect is usually larger than the income effect}@} due to {@{the small amount of gross income allocated by consumers on any given good}@}, and thus {@{the change in demand is usually insignificant in comparison to the substitution effect}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-18,255,330!2025-10-31,265,330!2025-12-03,291,330!2025-12-01,290,330!2025-10-08,246,330!2025-10-25,260,330!2025-10-14,252,330!2026-11-25,540,310-->

## Giffen goods

- see: [Giffen good](Giffen%20good.md)

{@{A special type of inferior good}@} {@{may exist known as the [Giffen good](Giffen%20good.md)}@}, which {@{would disobey the "[law of demand](law%20of%20demand.md)"}@}. Quite simply, when {@{the price of a Giffen good increases, the demand for that good increases}@}. This would have to be {@{a particular good that is such a large proportion of a person or market's consumption}@} that {@{the [income effect](consumer%20choice.md#income%20effect) of a price increase would produce, effectively, more demand}@}. {@{The observed [demand curve](demand%20curve.md)}@} would {@{slope _upward_, indicating positive [elasticity](price%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md)}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-13,276,330!2028-08-02,1048,350!2025-10-16,253,330!2025-11-03,268,330!2027-11-11,829,330!2025-10-25,260,330!2028-07-25,1042,350!2025-09-30,241,330-->

Giffen goods were {@{first noted by [Sir Robert Giffen](Robert%20Giffen.md)}@}. It is usual to attribute Giffen's observation to the fact that {@{in Ireland during the 19th century there was a rise in the price of potatoes}@}. The explanation follows that {@{poor people were forced to reduce their consumption of meat and expensive items such as eggs}@}. {@{Potatoes, still being the cheapest food}@}, meant that {@{poor people started consuming more even though its price was rising}@}. This phenomenon is {@{often described as "Giffen's Paradox"}@}. However, it has been {@{noticed<!-- <sup>\[_[by whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual%20of%20Style/Words%20to%20watch#Unsupported%20attributions)_\]</sup> --> that Giffen did not use potatoes as an example of Giffen goods}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> Moreover, {@{potatoes were not Giffen Goods during the [Great Famine](Great%20Famine%20(Ireland).md) in Ireland}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> {@{[Alfred Marshall's](Alfred%20Marshall.md) explanation of Giffen's Paradox}@} was {@{presented in terms of bread}@}.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-04,244,330!2025-11-29,288,330!2025-10-13,251,330!2025-12-03,291,330!2025-12-04,292,330!2028-07-20,1038,350!2027-07-26,734,330!2025-11-27,286,330!2026-11-02,519,310!2025-10-20,256,330-->
