# Rutherford model

The __{@{Rutherford}@} model__ is {@{a historical scientific model of the [atom](atom.md)}@}. The model has {@{[electrons](electron.md) orbiting around a tiny and heavy central positive charge called the "[nucleus](nucleus.md)"}@}. It was first proposed by {@{[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md) in 1911}@}.

## problems

Orbiting electrons {@{undergo acceleration}@}, so {@{[electromagnetic waves](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) should be emitted}@}. The electrons {@{lose energy}@}, {@{spiralling inwards and collapsing into the nucleus}@}. This is problematic as {@{the model implies all atoms are unstable}@}. Also, as the electrons spiral inwards, {@{the frequency of emission increases}@} as {@{the orbital period becomes shorter}@}, so {@{a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiation should be emitted}@}. However, it is observed that {@{radiation are emitted at discrete frequencies}@}.
