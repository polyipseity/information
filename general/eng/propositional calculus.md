# propositional calculus

- Not to be confused with [propositional analysis](theory%20of%20descriptions.md).

The __propositional calculus__ is {@{a branch of [logic](logic.md)}@}. It is also called {@{__propositional logic__, __statement logic__, __sentential calculus__, __sentential logic__, or sometimes __zeroth-order logic__}@}. It deals with {@{[propositions](proposition.md) (which can be [true or false](truth%20value.md)) and relations between propositions, including the construction of arguments based on them}@}. Compound propositions are formed by {@{connecting propositions by [logical connectives](logical%20connective.md) representing the [truth functions](truth%20function.md) of [conjunction](logical%20conjunction.md), [disjunction](logical%20disjunction.md), [implication](material%20conditional.md), [biconditional](logical%20biconditional.md), and [negation](negation.md)}@}. Some sources {@{include other connectives, as in the table below}@}.

Unlike {@{[first-order logic](first-order%20logic.md)}@}, propositional logic {@{does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them, or [quantifiers](quantifier%20(logic).md)}@}. However, all the machinery of propositional logic is {@{included in first-order logic and higher-order logics. In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic}@}.

Propositional logic is typically studied with {@{a [formal language](formal%20language.md)}@}, in which {@{propositions are represented by letters, which are called _[propositional variables](propositional%20variable.md)_}@}. These are then used, {@{together with symbols for connectives, to make compound propositions}@}. Because of this, the propositional variables are called {@{_[atomic formulas](atomic%20formula.md)_ of a formal zeroth-order language}@}. While the atomic propositions are typically represented by {@{letters of the [alphabet](alphabet.md), there is a variety of notations to represent the logical connectives}@}. The following table shows the main notational variants for each of the connectives in propositional logic.

> __Notational variants of the connectives__
>
> - [AND](logical%20conjunction.md) ::@:: $A\land B$, $A\cdot B$, $AB$, $A\&B$, $A\&\&B$
> - [equivalent](logical%20biconditional.md) ::@:: $A\equiv B$, $A\Leftrightarrow B$, $A\leftrightharpoons B$
> - [implies](material%20conditional.md) ::@:: $A\Rightarrow B$, $A\supset B$, $A\rightarrow B$
> - [NAND](sheffer%20stroke.md) ::@:: $A{\overline {\land } }B$, $A\mid B$, ${\overline {A\cdot B} }$
> - nonequivalent ::@:: $A\not \equiv B$, $A\not \Leftrightarrow B$, $A\nleftrightarrow B$
> - [NOR](Logical%20NOR.md) ::@:: $A{\overline {\lor } }B$, $A\downarrow B$, ${\overline {A+B} }$
> - [NOT](negation.md) ::@:: $\neg A$, $-A$, ${\overline {A} }$, $\sim A$
> - [OR](logical%20disjunction.md) ::@:: $A\lor B$, $A+B$, $A\mid B$, $A\parallel B$
> - [XNOR](XNOR%20gate.md) ::@:: $A\odot B$
> - [XOR](exclusive%20or.md) ::@:: $A{\underline {\lor } }B$, $A\oplus B$

The most thoroughly researched branch of propositional logic is {@{__classical truth-functional propositional logic__, in which formulas are interpreted as having precisely one of two possible [truth values](truth%20value.md), the truth value of _true_ or the truth value of _false_}@}. {@{The [principle of bivalence](principle%20of%20bivalence.md) and the [law of excluded middle](law%20of%20excluded%20middle.md)}@} are upheld. By comparison with [first-order logic](first-order%20logic.md), {@{truth-functional propositional logic is considered to be _zeroth-order logic_}@}.
