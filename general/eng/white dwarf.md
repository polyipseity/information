# white dwarf

A __white dwarf__ is {@{a [stellar core remnant](compact%20object.md) composed mostly of [electron-degenerate matter](degenerate%20matter.md#degenerate%20gases)}@}. A white dwarf is {@{very [dense](density.md): its mass is comparable to the [Sun](Sun.md)'s, while its volume is comparable to [Earth](Earth.md)'s}@}. A white dwarf's low [luminosity](luminosity.md) comes from {@{the [emission](thermal%20radiation.md) of residual [thermal energy](heat.md); no fusion takes place in a white dwarf}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-13,241,330!2025-04-22,185,310!2026-06-23,513,310-->

## formation

White dwarfs are thought to represent {@{the end point of [stellar evolution](stellar%20evolution.md) for main-sequence stars with masses from about 0.07 to 10 M<sub>☉</sub>}@}. The composition of the white dwarf produced will depend on {@{the initial mass of the star}@}. Current galactic models suggest the Milky Way galaxy currently contains {@{about ten billion white dwarfs}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-23,172,270!2026-07-27,549,330!2025-03-29,172,290-->

### stars with very low mass

If the mass of a main-sequence star is {@{lower than approximately half a [solar mass](solar%20mass.md)}@}, it will {@{never become hot enough to ignite and fuse helium in its core}@}. It is thought that, over {@{a lifespan that considerably exceeds the age of the universe (c. 13.8 billion years)}@}, such a star will {@{eventually burn all its hydrogen, for a while becoming a [blue dwarf](blue%20dwarf%20(red-dwarf%20stage).md), and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of [helium-4](helium-4.md) nuclei}@}. Due to the very long time this process takes, it is {@{not thought to be the origin of the observed helium white dwarfs. Rather, they are thought to be the product of mass loss in binary systems or mass loss due to a large planetary companion}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-20,404,290!2025-02-28,136,290!2026-05-25,462,310!2025-03-28,147,250!2025-03-11,164,310-->

### stars with low to medium mass

If the mass of a main-sequence star is {@{between 0.5 and 8 M<sub>☉</sub>}@}, its core will {@{become sufficiently hot to fuse helium into [carbon](carbon.md) and [oxygen](oxygen.md) via the [triple-alpha process](triple-alpha%20process.md), but it will never become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon into [neon](neon.md)}@}. Near the end of the period in which it undergoes fusion reactions, such a star will {@{have a carbon–oxygen core which does not undergo fusion reactions, surrounded by an inner helium-burning shell and an outer hydrogen-burning shell}@}. On the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, it will be found on {@{the asymptotic giant branch}@}. It will then {@{expel most of its outer material, creating a [planetary nebula](planetary%20nebula.md)}@}, until {@{only the carbon–oxygen core is left}@}. This process is responsible for {@{the carbon–oxygen white dwarfs which form the vast majority of observed white dwarfs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-18,566,330!2025-08-29,277,290!2025-04-24,161,250!2025-12-14,335,290!2025-11-17,320,290!2025-07-02,211,270!2026-03-30,398,290-->

### stars with medium to high mass

If a star is {@{massive enough}@}, its core will {@{eventually become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon to neon, and then to fuse neon to iron}@}. Such a star will {@{not become a white dwarf}@}, because {@{the mass of its central, non-fusing core, initially supported by electron degeneracy pressure, will eventually exceed the largest possible mass supportable by degeneracy pressure}@}. At this point the core of the star will {@{[collapse](gravitational%20collapse.md) and it will explode in a [core-collapse supernova](supernova.md#core%20collapse) which will leave behind a remnant neutron star, [black hole](black%20hole.md), or possibly a more exotic form of [compact star](compact%20object.md)}@}. Some main-sequence stars, of {@{perhaps 8 to 10 M<sub>☉</sub>}@}, although {@{sufficiently massive to [fuse carbon to neon and magnesium](carbon-burning%20process.md), may be insufficiently massive to [fuse neon](neon-burning%20process.md)}@}. Such a star {@{may leave a remnant white dwarf composed chiefly of [oxygen](oxygen.md), neon, and [magnesium](magnesium.md)}@}, provided that {@{its core does not collapse, and provided that fusion does not proceed so violently as to blow apart the star in a [supernova](supernova.md)}@}. Although {@{a few white dwarfs have been identified which may be of this type}@}, most evidence for the existence of such comes from {@{the novae called _ONeMg_ or _neon_ novae}@}. The spectra of these [novae](nova.md) {@{exhibit abundances of neon, magnesium, and other intermediate-mass elements which appear to be only explicable by the accretion of material onto an oxygen–neon–magnesium white dwarf}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-09,236,330!2026-08-17,543,310!2025-03-28,176,310!2026-01-22,373,310!2025-11-06,310,290!2025-11-06,344,310!2025-05-07,170,250!2025-05-01,167,250!2025-07-29,262,290!2026-03-02,372,270!2025-10-04,273,270!2025-04-03,147,250-->

## binary stars and novae

If {@{a white dwarf is in a binary star system and is accreting matter from its companion}@}, a variety of phenomena may occur, including {@{[novae](nova.md) and Type Ia supernovae}@}. It may also be {@{a [super-soft X-ray source](super%20soft%20X-ray%20source.md) if it is able to take material from its companion fast enough to sustain fusion on its surface}@}. On the other hand, phenomena in binary systems such as {@{tidal interaction and star–disc interaction, moderated by magnetic fields or not}@}, act on the rotation of accreting white dwarfs. In fact, the (securely known) fastest-spinning white dwarfs are {@{members of binary systems}@} (the fastest one being the white dwarf in CTCV J2056-3014). A close binary system of two white dwarfs can {@{lose angular momentum and radiate energy in the form of [gravitational waves](gravitational%20wave.md), causing their mutual orbit to steadily shrink until the stars merge}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-09,310,330!2025-11-16,285,250!2025-05-21,189,270!2025-12-27,381,310!2025-04-02,176,310!2025-03-09,22,285-->
