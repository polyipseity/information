# white dwarf

A __white dwarf__ is {@{a [stellar core remnant](compact%20object.md) composed mostly of [electron-degenerate matter](degenerate%20matter.md#degenerate%20gases)}@}. A white dwarf is {@{very [dense](density.md): its mass is comparable to the [Sun](Sun.md)'s, while its volume is comparable to [Earth](Earth.md)'s}@}. A white dwarf's low [luminosity](luminosity.md) comes from {@{the [emission](thermal%20radiation.md) of residual [thermal energy](heat.md); no fusion takes place in a white dwarf}@}. <!--SR:!2028-06-12,1095,350!2027-07-02,801,330!2026-06-23,513,310-->

## formation

White dwarfs are thought to represent {@{the end point of [stellar evolution](stellar%20evolution.md) for main-sequence stars with masses from about 0.07 to 10 M<sub>☉</sub>}@}. The composition of the white dwarf produced will depend on {@{the initial mass of the star}@}. Current galactic models suggest the Milky Way galaxy currently contains {@{about ten billion white dwarfs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-30,463,270!2026-07-27,549,330!2027-02-20,693,310-->

### stars with very low mass

If {@{the mass of a main-sequence star}@} is {@{lower than approximately half a [solar mass](solar%20mass.md)}@}, it will {@{never become hot enough to ignite and fuse helium in its core}@}. It is thought that, over {@{a lifespan that considerably exceeds the age of the universe \(c. 13.8 billion years\)}@}, such a star will {@{eventually burn all its hydrogen, for a while becoming a [blue dwarf](blue%20dwarf%20(red-dwarf%20stage).md)}@}, and end its evolution as {@{a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of [helium-4](helium-4.md) nuclei}@}. Due to {@{the very long time this process takes}@}, it is {@{not thought to be the origin of the observed helium white dwarfs}@}. Rather, they are thought to be {@{the product of mass loss in binary systems or mass loss due to a large planetary companion}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-20,404,290!2026-09-02,551,310!2026-05-25,462,310!2026-08-29,519,270!2027-02-20,711,330!2025-12-17,85,353!2025-12-09,78,353!2025-12-17,85,353!2025-12-08,77,353-->

### stars with low to medium mass

If the mass of a main-sequence star is {@{between 0.5 and 8 M<sub>☉</sub>}@}, its core will {@{become sufficiently hot to fuse helium into [carbon](carbon.md) and [oxygen](oxygen.md) via the [triple-alpha process](triple-alpha%20process.md), but it will never become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon into [neon](neon.md)}@}. Near the end of the period in which it undergoes fusion reactions, such a star will {@{have a carbon–oxygen core which does not undergo fusion reactions, surrounded by an inner helium-burning shell and an outer hydrogen-burning shell}@}. On the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, it will be found on {@{the asymptotic giant branch}@}. It will then {@{expel most of its outer material, creating a [planetary nebula](planetary%20nebula.md)}@}, until {@{only the carbon–oxygen core is left}@}. This process is responsible for {@{the carbon–oxygen white dwarfs which form the vast majority of observed white dwarfs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-18,566,330!2026-01-17,141,270!2026-11-16,571,270!2025-12-14,335,290!2029-06-03,1294,310!2027-09-05,795,290!2026-03-30,398,290-->

### stars with medium to high mass

If a star is {@{massive enough}@}, its core will {@{eventually become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon to neon, and then to fuse neon to iron}@}. Such a star will {@{not become a white dwarf}@}, because {@{the mass of its central, non-fusing core, initially supported by electron degeneracy pressure}@}, will eventually {@{exceed the largest possible mass supportable by degeneracy pressure}@}. At this point {@{the core of the star}@} will {@{[collapse](gravitational%20collapse.md)}@} and it will {@{explode in a [core-collapse supernova](supernova.md#core%20collapse)}@} which will leave behind {@{a remnant neutron star, [black hole](black%20hole.md), or possibly a more exotic form of [compact star](compact%20object.md)}@}. {@{Some main-sequence stars}@}, of {@{perhaps 8 to 10 M<sub>☉</sub>}@}, although {@{sufficiently massive to [fuse carbon to neon and magnesium](carbon-burning%20process.md)}@}, may be {@{insufficiently massive to [fuse neon](neon-burning%20process.md)}@}. Such a star may leave {@{a remnant white dwarf composed chiefly of [oxygen](oxygen.md), neon, and [magnesium](magnesium.md)}@}, provided that {@{its core does not collapse}@}, and provided that fusion does not {@{proceed so violently as to blow apart the star in a [supernova](supernova.md)}@}. Although {@{a few white dwarfs have been identified which may be of this type}@}, most evidence for the existence of such comes from {@{the novae called _ONeMg_ or _neon_ novae}@}. {@{The spectra of these [novae](nova.md)}@} exhibit {@{abundances of neon, magnesium, and other intermediate-mass elements}@} which appear to be {@{only explicable by the accretion of material onto an oxygen–neon–magnesium white dwarf}@}. <!--SR:!2028-05-20,1074,350!2026-08-17,543,310!2027-04-26,759,330!2026-01-22,373,310!2026-04-10,155,270!2029-11-21,1476,330!2026-07-11,430,250!2026-12-07,584,270!2028-06-22,1057,310!2026-03-02,372,270!2028-07-27,1027,290!2026-04-12,374,250!2026-02-09,82,360!2025-11-20,18,340!2025-11-20,18,340!2025-11-20,18,340!2025-11-20,18,340!2026-02-08,81,360!2026-02-10,83,360!2025-11-20,18,340!2026-02-10,83,360-->

## binary stars and novae

If {@{a white dwarf is in a binary star system and is accreting matter from its companion}@}, a variety of phenomena may occur, including {@{[novae](nova.md) and Type Ia supernovae}@}. It may also be {@{a [super-soft X-ray source](super%20soft%20X-ray%20source.md) if it is able to take material from its companion fast enough to sustain fusion on its surface}@}. On the other hand, phenomena in binary systems such as {@{tidal interaction and star–disc interaction, moderated by magnetic fields or not}@}, act on the rotation of accreting white dwarfs. In fact, the (securely known) fastest-spinning white dwarfs are {@{members of binary systems}@} (the fastest one being the white dwarf in CTCV J2056-3014). A close binary system of two white dwarfs can {@{lose angular momentum and radiate energy in the form of [gravitational waves](gravitational%20wave.md), causing their mutual orbit to steadily shrink until the stars merge}@}. <!--SR:!2029-07-21,1411,350!2028-08-12,1000,270!2027-05-05,714,290!2025-12-27,381,310!2027-04-27,755,330!2026-02-02,264,305-->
