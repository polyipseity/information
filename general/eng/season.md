# season

## causes and effects

### axial parallelism

The [Earth's orbit](Earth's%20orbit.md) exhibits {@{approximate [axial parallelism](axial%20parallelism.md), mostly maintaining its direction toward [Polaris](Polaris.md) (the "[North Star](pole%20star.md)") year-round}@}. This is one of the primary reasons for the Earth's seasons, as it allows {@{the hemispheres to be tilted differently relative to the [Sun](Sun.md) depending on the Earth's position in the orbit}@}. Minor variation {@{in the direction of the axis, known as [axial precession](axial%20precession.md), takes place over the course of about 26&nbsp;000 years}@}, and therefore {@{is not noticeable to modern human civilization}@}.

### axial tilt

The seasons result from {@{the [Earth](Earth.md)'s [axis of rotation](rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md) being tilted with respect to its orbital plane by an angle of approximately 23.4 degrees}@}, known as [axial tilt](axial%20tilt.md) or {@{obliquity of the [ecliptic](ecliptic.md)}@}.

Regardless of {@{the time of year}@}, {@{the [northern](Northern%20Hemisphere.md) and [southern](Souther%20Hemisphere.md) hemispheres always experience opposite seasons}@}.

The effect of axial tilt is observable as {@{the change in [day length](daytime.md) and altitude (also see [analemma](analemma.md)) of the [Sun](Sun.md) at solar [noon](noon.md) (the Sun's [culmination](culmination.md)) during the year}@}. The change in day length leads to {@{[sunlight](sunlight.md) being shone on the surface for different amount of time in a day, affecting how much energy is transmitted in a day}@}. The low altitude of Sun {@{during [winter](winter.md) means that incoming rays of solar radiation are spread over a larger area of the Earth's surface, so the light received is more indirect and of lower [intensity](solar%20irradiance.md)}@}. The intensity can be approximated by {@{multiplying $\cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the [normal](normal%20(geometry).md) of the surface and the direction of solar radiation}@}. These two effects {@{caused by axial tilt accounts for most of the seasonal variation in [climate](climate.md) in both hemispheres}@}.

For the same reason {@{as in [§ elliptical Earth orbit](#elliptical%20Earth%20orbit)}@}, axial tilt {@{making some parts of the [Earth's surface](geoid.md) being closer or farther to the [Sun](Sun.md) does not contribute much to seasons}@}, considering that {@{the difference is very small—up to only thousands of [kilometers](kilometre.md)—compared to Earth's [orbital distance](semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes.md)}@}.

### elliptical Earth orbit

Compared to [axial parallelism](#axial%20parallelism) and [axial tilt](#axial%20tilt), {@{other factors contribute little to seasonal [temperature](temperature.md) changes}@}. The seasons are {@{not caused by the variation in [Earth](Earth.md)'s distance to the [Sun](Sun.md) because of its [elliptical orbit](elliptic%20orbit.md)}@}. In fact, Earth reaches {@{[perihelion](apsis.md#perihelion%20and%20aphelion) (the point in its orbit closest to the Sun) in [January](January.md), and it reaches [aphelion](apsis.md#perihelion%20and%20aphelion) (the point farthest from the Sun) in [July](July.md)}@}, so {@{the slight contribution of [orbital eccentricity](orbital%20eccentricity.md) opposes the [temperature](temperature.md) trends of the seasons in the [Northern Hemisphere](Northern%20Hemisphere.md)}@}. In general, as the Earth's [orbital distance](semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes.md) {@{varies by about 3%, sunlight received varies by only about 7%}@}.
