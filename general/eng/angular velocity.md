# angular velocity

## orbital angular velocity of a point particle

The angular velocity $\omega$ is {@{the rate of change of angular position with respect to time, which can be computed from the cross-radial velocity}@} as: {@{$$\omega = \frac {\mathrm{d}\phi} {\mathrm{d}t} = \frac {v_{\perp} } r$$}@}. Here, the cross-radial speed $v_{\perp}$ is {@{the signed magnitude of $\mathbf{v}_{\perp}$, positive for counterclockwise motion, negative for clockwise}@}, and the radius $r$ is {@{the distance from the center}@}. <!--SR:!2028-04-28,1087,350!2025-07-03,284,330!2026-05-06,471,310!2028-06-15,1118,350-->
