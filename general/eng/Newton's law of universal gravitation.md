# Newton's law of universal gravitation

__Newton's law of universal gravitation__ says that {@{every [particle](particle.md) attracts every other particle in the [universe](universe.md) with a [force](force.md)}@} that is {@{[proportional](proportionality%20(mathematics).md#direct%20proportionality) to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers}@}. Separated objects attract and are {@{attracted [as if all their mass were concentrated at their centers](shell%20theorem.md)}@}.

The equation for universal gravitation thus takes the form: {@{$$F = G \frac {m_1 m_2} {r^2}$$}@}, where {@{$F$ is the gravitational force between two objects, respectively of [mass](mass.md) $m_1$ and $m_2$, and $r$ is the distance between their [centers of mass](center%20of%20mass.md), and $G$ is the [gravitational constant](gravitational%20constant.md)}@} ({@{$G = 6.674\,30(15) \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{\ N\ m^2\ kg^{-2} }$}@}).
