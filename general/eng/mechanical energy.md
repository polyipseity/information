# mechanical energy

## conservation of mechanical energy

### satellite

- see: [vis-viva equation](vis-viva%20equation.md)

A satellite in orbit conserves {@{its mechanical energy, which is the sum of its [kinetic energy](kinetic%20energy.md) and its [gravitational potential energy](gravitational%20energy.md)}@}. This explains the closer the satellite is to Earth, {@{the higher its [velocity](velocity.md), and vice versa}@}. <!--SR:!2028-03-10,1028,350!2028-05-15,1078,350-->
