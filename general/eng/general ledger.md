# general ledger

In [bookkeeping](bookkeeping.md), a __general ledger__ is {@{a bookkeeping [ledger](ledger.md) in which accounting data are posted from [journals](general%20journal.md) and aggregated from [subledgers](subledger.md)}@}, such as {@{[accounts payable](accounts%20payable.md), [accounts receivable](accounts%20receivable.md), [cash management](cash%20management.md), [fixed assets](fixed%20asset.md), purchasing and projects}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> A general ledger may be maintained {@{on paper, on a computer, or in the cloud}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> A ledger account is created {@{for each account in the [chart of accounts](chart%20of%20accounts.md) for an organization}@} and is classified into {@{account categories, such as income, expense, assets, liabilities, and equity}@}; {@{the collection of all these accounts}@} is known as {@{the general ledger}@}. The general ledger holds {@{financial and non-financial data for an organization}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> Each account in the general ledger consists of {@{one or more pages}@}. It includes details such as {@{the date of sale, invoice number, customer details, and the amount due}@}. This ledger helps {@{businesses track outstanding receivables and manage [cash flow](cash%20flow.md) efficiently}@}. {@{An organization's [statement of financial position](balance%20sheet.md) and the [income statement](income%20statement.md)}@} are both {@{derived from income and expense account categories in the general ledger}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-05-04,157,310!2025-02-18,98,270!2025-04-01,144,310!2025-05-07,169,310!2025-08-25,240,290!2025-09-08,271,330!2025-06-28,209,310!2025-08-31,266,330!2025-09-07,270,330!2025-03-05,110,290!2025-06-06,193,310!2025-04-27,148,290!2025-06-18,190,310-->

## terminology

The general ledger contains {@{a page for all accounts in the chart of accounts<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> arranged by account categories}@}. The general ledger is usually divided into {@{at least seven main categories: assets, liabilities, owner's equity, revenue, expenses, gains and losses}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> It is {@{the system of record}@} for {@{an organizationâ€™s financial transactions}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> The main categories of the general ledger may be further subdivided into {@{[subledgers](subledger.md) to include additional details of such accounts as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, etc.}@} <!--SR:!2025-09-10,272,330!2025-02-18,97,270!2025-09-01,265,330!2025-10-10,297,330!2025-03-31,130,290-->

{@{The extraction of account balances}@} is called {@{a [trial balance](trial%20balance.md)}@}. The purpose of the trial balance is, {@{at a preliminary stage of the [financial statement](financial%20statement.md) preparation process, to ensure the equality of the total [debits](debits%20and%20credits.md) and [credits](debits%20and%20credits.md)}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-09-19,280,330!2025-07-20,232,330!2025-01-12,81,290-->

## process

Posting is {@{the process of recording amounts as credits (right side), and amounts as debits (left side), in the pages of the general ledger}@}. {@{Additional columns to the right}@} hold {@{a running activity total (similar to a chequebook)}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-06-13,199,310!2025-06-16,200,310!2025-06-07,194,310-->

The general ledger should include {@{the date, description and balance or total amount for each account}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-24,125,290-->

Because {@{each bookkeeping entry debits one account and credits another account in an equal amount}@}, {@{the [double-entry bookkeeping system](double-entry%20bookkeeping.md)}@} helps {@{ensure that the general ledger is always in balance, thus maintaining the [accounting equation](accounting%20equation.md)}@}: {@{Assets = Liabilities + (Shareholder's or Owner's equity)}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup><sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-04-15,152,310!2025-05-04,167,310!2025-08-24,260,330!2025-08-25,261,330-->

{@{The accounting equation}@} is {@{the mathematical structure of the [balance sheet](balance%20sheet.md)}@}. Although {@{a general ledger appears to be fairly simple}@}, in {@{large or complex organizations or organizations with various subsidiaries, the general ledger can grow to be quite large and take several hours or days to audit or balance}@}. In {@{a manual or non-computerized system}@}, the general ledger {@{may be a large book}@}. Organizations may instead {@{employ one or more [spreadsheets](spreadsheet.md) for their ledgers, including the general ledger, or may utilize [specialized software](accounting%20software.md) to automate ledger entry and handling}@}. When {@{a business uses [enterprise resource planning (ERP)](enterprise%20resource%20planning.md) software}@}, {@{a financial-features module produces subledgers and the general ledger, with entries drawn from a database that is shared with other processes managed through the ERP}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-21,203,310!2025-09-09,273,330!2025-03-16,126,290!2025-04-01,145,310!2025-08-13,251,330!2025-07-29,238,330!2025-03-01,111,290!2025-06-12,197,310!2025-05-09,157,290-->
