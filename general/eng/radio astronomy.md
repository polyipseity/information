# radio astronomy

__Radio astronomy__ is {@{a subfield of [astronomy](astronomy.md) that studies [celestial objects](astronomical%20object.md) at [radio frequencies](radio%20frequency.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-01,840,330-->

## techniques

### radio telescopes

- see: [radio telescope](radio%20telescope.md)

Radio telescopes may need to be {@{extremely large in order to receive signals with low [signal-to-noise ratio](signal-to-noise%20ratio.md)}@}. Also, [angular resolution](angular%20resolution.md) is {@{a function of the ratio of the [wavelength](wavelength.md) of the observed [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) $\lambda$ over the [diameter](diameter.md) of the "[objective](objective%20(optics).md)" $D$ ([aperture](aperture.md)), $\theta \approx \sin \theta = 1.22 \lambda / D$}@}. Since {@{the wavelength of [radio waves](radio%20wave.md) are high, typically larger than 1 mm (1×10<sup>-3</sup>&nbsp;m)}@}, so to get the same angular resolution, {@{radio telescopes need to be much larger in comparison to their [optical](optical%20telescope.md) counterparts}@}. The latter observes {@{[visible light](visible%20light.md) that has a wavelength typically between 400 nm (4×10<sup>-7</sup>&nbsp;m) and 700 nm (7×10<sup>-7</sup>&nbsp;m)}@}. For example, a 1-meter diameter optical telescope is {@{two million times bigger than the wavelength of light observed giving it a resolution of roughly 0.3 [arcseconds](minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc.md)}@}, whereas a radio telescope "dish" many times that size may, depending on the wavelength observed, only be able to {@{resolve an object the size of the full moon (30 [arcminutes](minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc.md))}@}. <!--SR:!2027-02-28,724,330!2025-06-03,238,330!2025-06-26,213,270!2027-01-17,678,330!2025-09-13,323,330!2025-12-22,349,290!2025-12-11,331,290-->
