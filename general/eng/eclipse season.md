# eclipse season

An __eclipse season__ is {@{a period, roughly every six months, when [eclipses](eclipse.md) occur}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-15,453,310-->

{@{Only two \(or occasionally three\) eclipse seasons}@} occur {@{during each year}@}, and each season {@{lasts about 35 days}@} and {@{repeats just short of six months \(173 days\) later}@}, thus {@{two _full_ eclipse seasons always occur each year}@}. <!--SR:!2031-02-15,1831,330!2027-07-14,697,270!2027-05-28,805,330!2026-09-03,295,350!2026-09-02,294,350-->
