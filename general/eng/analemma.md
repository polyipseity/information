# analemma

In [astronomy](astronomy.md), an __analemma__ ({@{/ˌænəˈlɛmə/}@}; from {@{[Ancient Greek](Ancient%20Greek.md) ἀνάλημμα (analēmma) 'support'}@}) is {@{a [diagram](diagram.md) showing the [position of the Sun](position%20of%20the%20Sun.md) in the sky as seen from a fixed location on [Earth](Earth.md) at the same [mean solar time](solar%20time.md#mean%20solar%20time)}@}, as that position {@{varies over the course of a year}@}. The diagram will resemble {@{a [figure eight](lemniscate.md)}@}.

To identify whether analemma is mirrored, note that the [Sun](Sun.md) moves {@{[eastward](east.md) on the analemma near the solstices (the top and bottom of the figure eight)}@}.
