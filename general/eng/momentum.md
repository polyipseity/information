# momentum

In [Newtonian mechanics](Newtonian%20mechanics.md), __momentum__ (pl.: {@{__momenta__ or __momentums__}@}; more specifically {@{__linear momentum__ or __translational momentum__}@}) is {@{the [product](multiplication.md) of the [mass](mass.md) and [velocity](velocity.md) of an [object](physical%20object.md)}@}. It is {@{a [vector](vector%20(mathematics%20and%20physics).md) quantity, possessing a [magnitude](magnitude%20(mathematics).md) and a direction}@}. Given {@{$m$ is the mass of an object, and $\mathbf v$ is its velocity (also a vector quantity)}@}, then the object's momentum {@{$\mathbf p$ (from [Latin](Latin.md) _pellere_ "push, drive")}@} is: {@{$$\mathbf p = m \mathbf v$$}@}.

## definition in classical mechanics

### conservation

In {@{a [closed system](closed%20system.md) (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces)}@} the total momentum {@{remains constant}@}. This fact, known as {@{the __law of conservation of momentum__}@}, is implied by {@{[Newton's laws of motion](Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md)}@}.
