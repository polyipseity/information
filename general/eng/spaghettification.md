# spaghettification

In [astrophysics](astrophysics.md), __spaghettification__ (sometimes referred to as the __noodle effect__) is {@{the vertical stretching and horizontal compression of objects into long thin shapes (rather like [spaghetti](spaghetti.md)) in a very strong, non-[homogeneous](homogeneity%20and%20heterogeneity.md) [gravitational field](gravitational%20field.md)}@}. It is caused by {@{extreme [tidal forces](tidal%20force.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-24,309,290!2028-11-04,1211,350-->
