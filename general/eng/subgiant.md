# subgiant

## subgiant branch

### 0.4 M<sub>☉</sub> to 0.9 M<sub>☉</sub>

Stars with {@{40 percent the mass of the Sun and larger}@} have {@{non-convective cores with a strong temperature gradient from the centre outwards}@}. When they {@{exhaust hydrogen at the core of the star}@}, {@{the shell of hydrogen surrounding the central core}@} {@{continues to fuse without interruption}@}. The star is {@{considered to be a subgiant at this point although there is little change visible from the exterior}@}. As {@{the fusing hydrogen shell converts its mass into helium}@} {@{the convective effect}@} {@{separates the helium towards the core}@} where it {@{very slowly increases the mass of the non-fusing core of nearly pure helium plasma}@}. As this takes place {@{the fusing hydrogen shell gradually expands outward}@} which {@{increases the size of the outer shell of the star up to the subgiant size from 2 to 10 times the original radius of the star when it was on the main sequence}@}. The expansion of the outer layers of the star into the subgiant size {@{nearly balances the increase energy generated by the hydrogen shell fusion causing the star to nearly maintain its surface temperature}@}. This causes {@{the spectral class of the star to change very little in the lower end of this range of star mass}@}. The subgiant surface area radiating the energy is so much larger {@{the potential [circumstellar habitable zone](habitable%20zone.md) where planetary orbits will be in the range to form liquid water is shifted much further out into any planetary system}@}. The surface area of a sphere is {@{found as 4πr<sup>2</sup>}@} so a sphere with a radius of 2 R<sub>☉</sub> will release {@{4 times as much energy at the surface}@} and a sphere with a 10 R<sub>☉</sub> will release {@{100 times as much energy}@}.

The helium core mass is {@{below the [Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit](Schönberg–Chandrasekhar%20limit.md) and it remains in thermal equilibrium with the fusing hydrogen shell}@}. Its mass {@{continues to increase and the star very slowly expands as the hydrogen shell migrates outwards}@}. Any increase in energy output from the shell goes into {@{expanding the envelope of the star and the luminosity stays approximately constant}@}. The subgiant branch for these stars is {@{short (in the HR diagram, not in time), horizontal, and heavily populated, as visible in very old clusters}@}.

After {@{one to eight billion years}@}, the helium core becomes {@{too massive to support its own weight and becomes degenerate}@}. Its {@{temperature increases, the rate of fusion in the hydrogen shell increases}@}, the outer layers become {@{strongly convective}@}, and the luminosity {@{increases at approximately the same effective temperature}@}. The star is now {@{on the [red-giant branch](red-giant%20branch.md)}@}.

### 1<sub>☉</sub> to 8 M<sub>☉</sub>

Stars {@{as massive and larger than the Sun}@} have {@{a convective core on the main sequence}@}. They develop {@{a more massive helium core, taking up a larger fraction of the star}@}, before they {@{exhaust the hydrogen in the entire convective region}@}. Fusion in the star {@{ceases entirely and the core begins to contract and increase in temperature}@}. The entire star {@{contracts and increases in temperature}@}, with the radiated luminosity {@{actually increasing despite the lack of fusion}@}. \(annotation: For {@{stars close to 1 solar mass}@}, {@{only the core contracts}2}, and {@{the outer shell expands and cools}@} instead, though {@{the luminosity still increases}@}.\) This continues for {@{several million years before the core becomes hot enough to ignite hydrogen in a shell}@}, which {@{reverses the temperature and luminosity increase (eventually; initially, luminosity increases slightly) and the star starts to expand and cool}@}. \(annotation: For {@{stars close to 1 solar mass}@}, {@{the above still happens, but the hook in the HR diagram does not appear}@}.\) {@{This _hook_ (in the HR diagram)}@} is generally defined as {@{the end of the main sequence and the start of the subgiant branch in these stars}@}.

The core of stars below about 2 M<sub>☉</sub> is {@{still below the [Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit](Schönberg–Chandrasekhar%20limit.md)}@}, but {@{hydrogen shell fusion quickly increases the mass of the core beyond that limit}@}. More massive stars {@{already have cores above the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar mass when they leave the main sequence}@}. The exact initial mass at which stars will show a hook and at which they will leave the main sequence with cores above the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit depend on {@{the metallicity and the degree of [overshooting](convective%20overshoot.md) in the convective core}@}. Low metallicity {@{causes the central part of even low mass cores to be convectively unstable}@}, and overshooting causes {@{the core to be larger when hydrogen becomes exhausted}@}.

Once {@{the core exceeds the C–R limit}@}, it can {@{no longer remain in thermal equilibrium with the hydrogen shell}@}. It {@{contracts and the outer layers of the star expand and cool}@}. The energy to {@{expand the outer envelope causes the radiated luminosity to decrease}@}. When {@{the outer layers cool sufficiently}@}, they {@{become opaque and force convection to begin outside the fusing shell}@}. {@{The expansion stops (for a while) and the radiated luminosity begins to increase}@}, which is {@{defined as the start of the red giant branch for these stars}@}. Stars with {@{an initial mass approximately 1–2 M<sub>☉</sub>}@} can {@{develop a degenerate helium core before this point}@} and that will cause {@{the star to enter the red giant branch earlier, like for lower mass stars}@}.

{@{The core contraction and envelope expansion}@} is {@{very rapid, taking only a few million years}@}. In this time {@{the temperature of the star}@} will {@{cool from its main sequence value of 6&nbsp;000–30&nbsp;000 K to around 5&nbsp;000 K}@}. {@{Relatively few stars}@} are {@{seen in this stage of their evolution}@} and there is {@{an apparent lack in the H–R diagram known as the [Hertzsprung gap](Hertzsprung%20gap.md)}@}. It is most obvious in clusters {@{from a few hundred million to a few billion years old}@}.
