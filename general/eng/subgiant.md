# subgiant

## subgiant branch

### 0.4 M<sub>☉</sub> to 0.9 M<sub>☉</sub>

Stars with {@{40 percent the mass of the Sun and larger}@} have {@{non-convective cores with a strong temperature gradient from the centre outwards}@}. When they exhaust hydrogen at the core of the star, {@{the shell of hydrogen surrounding the central core continues to fuse without interruption}@}. The star is {@{considered to be a subgiant at this point although there is little change visible from the exterior}@}. As {@{the fusing hydrogen shell converts its mass into helium}@} the convective effect {@{separates the helium towards the core where it very slowly increases the mass of the non-fusing core of nearly pure helium plasma}@}. As this takes place {@{the fusing hydrogen shell gradually expands outward}@} which {@{increases the size of the outer shell of the star up to the subgiant size from 2 to 10 times the original radius of the star when it was on the main sequence}@}. The expansion of the outer layers of the star into the subgiant size {@{nearly balances the increase energy generated by the hydrogen shell fusion causing the star to nearly maintain its surface temperature}@}. This causes {@{the spectral class of the star to change very little in the lower end of this range of star mass}@}. The subgiant surface area radiating the energy is so much larger {@{the potential [circumstellar habitable zone](habitable%20zone.md) where planetary orbits will be in the range to form liquid water is shifted much further out into any planetary system}@}. The surface area of a sphere is {@{found as 4πr<sup>2</sup>}@} so a sphere with a radius of 2 R<sub>☉</sub> will release {@{4 times as much energy at the surface}@} and a sphere with a 10 R<sub>☉</sub> will release {@{100 times as much energy}@}. <!--SR:!2027-12-06,931,336!2025-10-23,253,230!2025-10-31,327,296!2026-08-07,520,290!2027-04-10,751,336!2027-08-03,752,276!2027-05-29,752,296!2025-11-28,282,236!2026-12-13,615,296!2027-10-07,762,256!2026-01-29,372,296!2029-01-21,1274,350!2029-06-28,1397,350!2029-01-28,1285,356-->

The helium core mass is {@{below the [Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit](Schönberg–Chandrasekhar%20limit.md) and it remains in thermal equilibrium with the fusing hydrogen shell}@}. Its mass {@{continues to increase and the star very slowly expands as the hydrogen shell migrates outwards}@}. Any increase in energy output from the shell goes into {@{expanding the envelope of the star and the luminosity stays approximately constant}@}. The subgiant branch for these stars is {@{short (in the HR diagram, not in time), horizontal, and heavily populated, as visible in very old clusters}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-28,381,310!2026-12-07,634,316!2026-04-30,396,256!2026-11-27,519,256-->

After {@{one to eight billion years}@}, the helium core becomes {@{too massive to support its own weight and becomes degenerate}@}. Its {@{temperature increases, the rate of fusion in the hydrogen shell increases}@}, the outer layers become {@{strongly convective}@}, and the luminosity {@{increases at approximately the same effective temperature}@}. The star is now {@{on the [red-giant branch](red-giant%20branch.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-31,538,316!2029-06-19,1398,356!2026-03-13,441,316!2027-03-16,589,256!2026-10-28,596,296!2027-01-19,664,316-->

### 1<sub>☉</sub> to 8 M<sub>☉</sub>

Stars {@{as massive and larger than the Sun}@} have {@{a convective core on the main sequence}@}. They develop {@{a more massive helium core, taking up a larger fraction of the star}@}, before they {@{exhaust the hydrogen in the entire convective region}@}. Fusion in the star {@{ceases entirely and the core begins to contract and increase in temperature}@}. The entire star {@{contracts and increases in temperature}@}, with the radiated luminosity {@{actually increasing despite the lack of fusion}@}. (For stars close to 1 solar mass, {@{only the core contracts, and the outer shell expands and cools instead, though the luminosity still increases}@}.) This continues for {@{several million years before the core becomes hot enough to ignite hydrogen in a shell}@}, which {@{reverses the temperature and luminosity increase (eventually; initially, luminosity increases slightly) and the star starts to expand and cool}@}. (For stars close to 1 solar mass, {@{the above still happens, but the hook in the HR diagram does not appear}@}.) This _hook_ (in the HR diagram) is {@{generally defined as the end of the main sequence and the start of the subgiant branch in these stars}@}. <!--SR:!2029-02-04,1282,350!2026-04-24,470,310!2027-09-21,773,290!2027-10-15,883,336!2027-11-16,857,296!2025-11-08,335,296!2027-08-26,816,296!2025-11-25,332,296!2026-09-13,554,296!2027-01-11,602,290!2029-06-05,1384,356!2025-12-03,88,363-->

The core of stars below about 2 M<sub>☉</sub> is {@{still below the [Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit](Schönberg–Chandrasekhar%20limit.md)}@}, but {@{hydrogen shell fusion quickly increases the mass of the core beyond that limit}@}. More massive stars {@{already have cores above the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar mass when they leave the main sequence}@}. The exact initial mass at which stars will show a hook and at which they will leave the main sequence with cores above the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit depend on {@{the metallicity and the degree of [overshooting](convective%20overshoot.md) in the convective core}@}. Low metallicity {@{causes the central part of even low mass cores to be convectively unstable}@}, and overshooting causes {@{the core to be larger when hydrogen becomes exhausted}@}. <!--SR:!2028-12-25,1254,350!2029-01-29,1286,356!2027-08-16,794,330!2027-07-22,765,290!2027-02-18,712,336!2025-11-18,327,296-->

Once {@{the core exceeds the C–R limit}@}, it can {@{no longer remain in thermal equilibrium with the hydrogen shell}@}. It {@{contracts and the outer layers of the star expand and cool}@}. The energy to {@{expand the outer envelope causes the radiated luminosity to decrease}@}. When {@{the outer layers cool sufficiently}@}, they {@{become opaque and force convection to begin outside the fusing shell}@}. {@{The expansion stops (for a while) and the radiated luminosity begins to increase}@}, which is {@{defined as the start of the red giant branch for these stars}@}. Stars with {@{an initial mass approximately 1–2 M<sub>☉</sub>}@} can {@{develop a degenerate helium core before this point}@} and that will cause {@{the star to enter the red giant branch earlier, like for lower mass stars}@}. <!--SR:!2029-02-21,1305,356!2029-06-20,1398,356!2026-06-15,473,276!2028-05-10,1000,296!2028-02-02,953,316!2026-11-04,592,296!2026-02-09,360,316!2027-09-18,876,336!2025-10-20,327,296!2029-05-07,1298,316!2026-02-28,427,316-->

The core contraction and envelope expansion is {@{very rapid, taking only a few million years}@}. In this time {@{the temperature of the star will cool from its main sequence value of 6&nbsp;000–30&nbsp;000 K to around 5&nbsp;000 K}@}. Relatively few stars are {@{seen in this stage of their evolution and there is an apparent lack in the H–R diagram known as the [Hertzsprung gap](hertzsprung%20gap.md)}@}. It is most obvious in clusters {@{from a few hundred million to a few billion years old}@}. <!--SR:!2026-11-13,607,296!2028-01-18,920,296!2025-11-26,274,276!2027-08-29,808,296-->
