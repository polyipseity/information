# stress

In [continuum mechanics](continnum%20mechanics.md), __stress__ is {@{a [physical quantity](physical%20quantity.md) describing [forces](force.md) present during [deformation](deformation%20(physics).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-04,573,290-->

## simple types

### uniaxial normal

Assume the system is {@{in equilibrium and not changing with time, and the weight can be neglected}@}. The stress {@{$\sigma$}@} for an {@{uniform straight rod across any horizontal cross section}@} can be represented by {@{a single number $\sigma$}@}, calculated with {@{the normal force $F$ divided by the cross sectional area $A$ it acts on}@}: {@{$$\sigma = \frac F A$$}@} <!--SR:!2030-05-29,1680,330!2028-07-07,1174,350!2026-02-17,472,310!2026-12-19,721,330!2028-03-11,1081,350!2026-07-13,600,330-->

Stress has units {@{N/m<sup>2</sup>}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-27,911,330-->
