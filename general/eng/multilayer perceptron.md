# multilayer perceptron

A __multilayer perceptron__ (__MLP__) is a name for {@{a modern [feedforward neural network](feedforward%20neural%20network.md)}@}, consisting of {@{fully connected neurons (each neuron in a layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer) with a nonlinear [activation function](activation%20function.md), organized in at least 3 layers}@}. It is notable for being able to {@{distinguish data that is not [linearly separable](linear%20separability.md)}@} and {@{approximate any [function](function%20(mathematics).md) from a certain [function space](function%20space.md), i.e. an _universal approximator_, by the [universal approximation theorem](universal%20approximation%20theorem.md)}@}.
