# tube

## concept

The tube system acts like {@{a non-perforated vertical [cantilevered](cantilever.md) tube, but with reduced stiffness due to openings along the external wall}@}. When subject to {@{bending by lateral forces}@}, {@{columns windward and leeward (opposite side of windward) experience tension and compression}@}, while {@{the frame (beams and columns) parallel to the force are subject to in-plane bending}@}.

The exterior structure is {@{a very stiff rigid frame with closely spaced columns around the perimeter (usually 2 m to 4 m), making a tube}@}. The materials can be {@{reinforced concrete or steel}@}. Since the columns and beams are {@{so closely spaced, the facade looks like a wall with perforated window openings}@}. The interior structure are {@{mostly columns and usually relatively few in numbers}@}. The exterior supports {@{some gravity loading and all lateral loading, while the interior supports some gravity loading}@}.

## variations

Example variations include {@{the (original) framed tube, braced/trussed tube, bundled tube, and tube-in-tube}@} systems.

Example buildings include {@{Chicago's DeWitt-Chestnut Apartments (framed tube)}@}, {@{Hopewell Center (tube-in-tube)}@}, {@{Chicago's 100-storey John-Hancock Building (braced/trussed tube)}@}, and {@{Chicago's Sears Towers (bundled tube)}@}.
