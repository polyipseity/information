# tube

## concept

The tube system acts like {@{a non-perforated vertical [cantilevered](cantilever.md) tube, but with reduced stiffness due to openings along the external wall}@}. When subject to {@{bending by lateral forces}@}, {@{columns windward and leeward (opposite side of windward) experience tension and compression}@}, while {@{the frame (beams and columns) parallel to the force are subject to in-plane bending}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-20,516,270!2026-06-15,537,290!2027-09-04,908,330!2025-07-03,280,290-->

The exterior structure is {@{a very stiff rigid frame with closely spaced columns around the perimeter (usually 2 m to 4 m), making a tube}@}. The materials can be {@{reinforced concrete or steel}@}. Since the columns and beams are {@{so closely spaced, the facade looks like a wall with perforated window openings}@}. The interior structure are {@{mostly columns and usually relatively few in numbers}@}. The exterior supports {@{some gravity loading and all lateral loading, while the interior supports some gravity loading}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-31,393,290!2026-08-01,556,290!2026-04-01,514,310!2026-01-20,409,290!2025-08-22,331,290-->

## variations

Example variations include {@{the (original) framed tube, braced/trussed tube, bundled tube, and tube-in-tube}@} systems. <!--SR:!2026-07-28,509,270-->

Example buildings include {@{Chicago's DeWitt-Chestnut Apartments (framed tube)}@}, {@{Hopewell Center (tube-in-tube)}@}, {@{Chicago's 100-storey John-Hancock Building (braced/trussed tube)}@}, and {@{Chicago's Sears Towers (bundled tube)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-04-20,760,290!2025-06-16,191,250!2025-05-05,172,250!2025-04-21,201,290-->
