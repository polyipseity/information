# total sum of squares

In {@{[statistical data analysis](statistics.md)}@} {@{the __total sum of squares__ \(__TSS__ or __SST__\)}@} is {@{a quantity that appears as part of a standard way of presenting results of such analyses}@}. For {@{a set of observations, $y_{i},i\leq n$}@}, it is defined as {@{the sum over all squared differences between the observations and their overall [mean](mean.md) ${\bar {y} }$}@}:<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {@{$$\mathrm {TSS} =\sum _{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-{\bar {y} }\right)^{2}$$}@} <!--SR:!2025-08-20,172,310!2025-03-26,64,310!2025-03-29,67,310!2025-03-18,57,310!2025-03-19,58,310!2025-03-28,66,310-->

For {@{wide classes of [linear models](linear%20regression.md)}@}, the total sum of squares equals {@{the [explained sum of squares](explained%20sum%20of%20squares.md) plus the [residual sum of squares](residual%20sum%20of%20squares.md)}@}. For {@{proof of this in the multivariate OLS case}@}, see {@{[partitioning in the general OLS model](explained%20sum%20of%20squares.md#Partitioning%20in%20the%20general%20OLS%20model)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-21,60,310!2025-03-18,57,310!2025-03-23,62,310!2025-03-24,63,310-->

In {@{[analysis of variance](analysis%20of%20variance.md) \(ANOVA\)}@} the total sum of squares is {@{the sum of the so-called "within-samples" sum of squares and "between-samples" sum of squares}@}, i.e., {@{partitioning of the sum of squares}@}. In {@{[multivariate analysis of variance](multivariate%20analysis%20of%20variance.md) \(MANOVA\)}@} the following equation applies<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> {@{$$\mathbf {T} =\mathbf {W} +\mathbf {B} ,$$}@} where {@{__T__ is the total sum of squares and products \(SSP\) [matrix](matrix%20(mathematics).md), __W__ is the within-samples SSP matrix and __B__ is the between-samples SSP matrix}@}. Similar terminology may also be {@{used in [linear discriminant analysis](linear%20discriminant%20analysis.md)}@}, where {@{__W__ and __B__ are respectively referred to as the within-groups and between-groups SSP matrices}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-22,61,310!2025-03-28,66,310!2025-11-18,246,330!2025-08-16,166,310!2025-11-07,236,330!2025-08-20,173,310!2025-08-02,160,310!2025-03-26,64,310-->
