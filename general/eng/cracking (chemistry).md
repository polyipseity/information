# cracking (chemistry)

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../../tools/utility.py.md
```

__Cracking__ is {@{the process of breaking down complex [organic compounds](organic%20compound.md) into smaller ones}@}. {@{[Alkanes](alkane.md), [alkenes](alkene.md), and sometimes [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) and [carbon](carbon.md)}@} are produced.

It is used to produce {@{extra [petrol](gasoline.md) and [alkenes](alkene.md)}@}.

## methodologies

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_table(
  __env__.cwf_sects('923d', '395a'),
  ('name', 'description',),
  (
    ('catalytic cracking', 'Uses [catalysts](catalysis.md) like [silica-alumina](amorphous%20silica-alumina.md) in a milder [temperature](temperature.md) and [pressure](pressure.md). The products can be controlled well.',),
    ('thermal cracking', 'Uses high [temperature](temperature.md) and [pressure](pressure.md). The products can be controlled fairly.',),
  ),
  lambda datum: map(cloze, datum),
)
```

### laboratory

Cracking can be performed in the laboratory. {@{[Glass wool](glass%20wool.md) soaked with [liquid](liquid.md) [paraffin](alkane.md)}@} can be used as the reactant. {@{Broken pieces of unglazed porcelain}@} can be used as the [catalyst](catalysis.md). {@{The catalyst, instead of the reactant to prevent rapid [vaporization](vaporization.md) of the reactant}@}, is {@{heated inside a container in the absence of air to prevent [combustion](combustion.md)}@}. {@{Vapors from the paraffin}@} crack on the catalyst. Gaseous products {@{are collected over [water](water.md)}@}. The container {@{is removed from water before stopping the heating to prevent flowing back or sucking back of water, which may crack the container}@}.
