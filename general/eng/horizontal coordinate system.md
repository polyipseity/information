# horizontal coordinate system

The __horizontal coordinate system__ is {@{a [celestial coordinate system](astronomical%20coordinate%20systems.md) that uses the observer's local [horizon](horizon.md) as the [fundamental plane](fundamental%20plane%20(spherical%20coordinates).md) to define two [angles](angle.md)}@}: {@{__altitude__ and [__azimuth__](azimuth.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-30,553,310!2025-12-03,316,250-->

## definition

This [celestial coordinate system](astronomical%20coordinate%20systems.md) divides {@{the [sky](sky.md) into two [hemispheres](sphere.md)}@}: {@{the upper (but not necessarily [northern](northern%20celestial%20hemisphere.md)) and the lower (but not necessarily [southern](southern%20celestial%20hemisphere.md)) hemisphere}@}. In the former, objects are {@{above the [horizon](horizon.md) and visible, while for the latter, they are below and hidden}@}. The [great circle](great%20circle.md) separating the hemispheres is called the {@{__celestial horizon__}@}. The pole of the upper hemisphere is {@{the [zenith](zenith.md) while that of the lower hemisphere is the [nadir](nadir.md)}@}. The [great circle](great%20circle.md) running through {@{the zenith, the nadir, and the north and south [celestial poles](celestial%20pole.md) (alternatively, the [true north](true%20north.md) and [south](south.md))}@} is {@{the [meridian](meridian%20(astronomy).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-02-12,1028,350!2025-08-07,311,330!2026-11-26,673,330!2026-02-11,397,290!2028-01-28,967,310!2026-01-21,377,290!2025-11-02,332,290-->

The following are {@{the two independent horizontal [angular coordinates](spherical%20coordinate%20system.md)}@}: <!--SR:!2026-07-10,506,310-->

- altitude (alt.) ::@:: Also referred to as elevation or apparent height. It is the angle between the object and the horizon. Positive means above the horizon. <!--SR:!2026-07-27,557,310!2027-05-22,756,330-->
- azimuth (az.) ::@:: It is the angle of the object around the horizon. Usually measured from [true north](true%20north.md) and increasing [eastward](east.md). <!--SR:!2025-12-26,266,250!2026-08-21,546,310-->
