# Sprague–Grundy theorem

<!-- | ![](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Ambox%20important.svg) | hide__This article has multiple issues.__ Please help __[improve it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:EditPage/Sprague%E2%80%93Grundy%20theorem)__ or discuss these issues on the __[talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sprague%E2%80%93Grundy%20theorem)__. _\([Learn how and when to remove these messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Maintenance%20template%20removal)\)_| This article includes a list of [general references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing%20sources#General%20references), but __it lacks sufficient corresponding [inline citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing%20sources#Inline%20citations)__. _\(June 2014\)_ | <p>  <br/> | This article __may be too technical for most readers to understand__. _\(June 2014\)_ | | -->

In {@{[combinatorial game theory](combinatorial%20game%20theory.md)}@}, the {@{__Sprague–Grundy theorem__}@} states that {@{every [impartial game](impartial%20game.md) under the [normal play convention](normal%20play%20convention.md) is equivalent to a one-heap game of [nim](Nim.md)}@}, or {@{to an infinite generalization of nim}@}. It can therefore be {@{represented as a [natural number](natural%20number.md), the size of the heap in its equivalent game of nim}@}, as {@{an [ordinal number](ordinal%20number.md) in the infinite generalization}@}, or alternatively as {@{a [nimber](nimber.md), the value of that one-heap game in an algebraic system whose addition operation combines multiple heaps to form a single equivalent heap in nim}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-22,108,290!2025-03-14,63,310!2025-04-26,82,270!2025-03-13,62,310!2025-04-30,86,270!2025-02-12,39,290!2025-04-28,83,270-->

{@{The __Grundy value__ or __nim-value__ of any impartial game}@} is {@{the unique nimber that the game is equivalent to}@}. In the case of {@{a game whose positions are indexed by the natural numbers \(like nim itself, which is indexed by its heap sizes\)}@}, {@{the sequence of nimbers for successive positions of the game}@} is {@{called the __nim-sequence__ of the game}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,63,310!2025-03-07,57,310!2025-03-05,55,310!2025-03-17,65,310!2025-03-08,58,310-->

{@{The Sprague–Grundy theorem and its proof}@} encapsulate the main results of a theory discovered {@{independently by [R. P. Sprague](Roland%20Sprague.md) \(1936\)<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> and [P. M. Grundy](Patrick%20Michael%20Grundy.md) \(1939\)}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-14,63,310!2025-03-26,59,250-->

## definitions

For {@{the purposes of the Sprague–Grundy theorem}@}, a ___game___ is {@{a two-player [sequential game](sequential%20game.md) of [perfect information](perfect%20information.md)}@} satisfying {@{the _ending condition_ \(all games come to an end: there are no infinite lines of play\) and the _normal play condition_ \(a player who cannot move loses\)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,56,310!2025-03-18,66,310!2025-03-19,67,310-->

At {@{any given point in the game}@}, a player's ___position___ is {@{the set of ___moves___ they are allowed to make}@}. As an example, we can define {@{the _zero game_ to be the two-player game where neither player has any legal moves}@}. Referring to {@{the two players as $A$ \(for Alice\) and $B$ \(for Bob\)}@}, we would {@{denote their positions as $(A,B)=(\{\},\{\})$}@}, since {@{the set of moves each player can make is empty}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,55,310!2025-03-14,63,310!2025-03-08,58,310!2025-03-13,62,310!2025-03-19,67,310!2025-03-16,64,310-->

{@{An ___[impartial game](impartial%20game.md)___}@} is one in which {@{at any given point in the game, each player is allowed exactly the same set of moves}@}. {@{Normal-play [nim](Nim.md)}@} is {@{an example of an impartial game}@}. In nim, there are {@{one or more heaps of objects}@}, and {@{two players \(we'll call them Alice and Bob\), take turns choosing a heap and removing 1 or more objects from it}@}. The winner is {@{the player who removes the final object from the final heap}@}. {@{The game is ___impartial___}@} because {@{for any given configuration of pile sizes, the moves Alice can make on her turn are exactly the same moves Bob would be allowed to make if it were his turn}@}. In contrast, {@{a game such as [checkers](checkers.md)}@} is {@{not impartial}@} because, supposing {@{Alice were playing red and Bob were playing black, for any given arrangement of pieces on the board}@}, if {@{it were Alice's turn, she would only be allowed to move the red pieces}@}, and if {@{it were Bob's turn, he would only be allowed to move the black pieces}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,66,310!2025-02-21,43,290!2025-03-16,64,310!2025-03-10,59,310!2025-03-13,62,310!2025-03-19,67,310!2025-03-14,63,310!2025-03-09,58,310!2025-05-10,101,290!2025-03-15,63,310!2025-03-13,62,310!2025-02-27,47,290!2025-03-06,56,310!2025-03-16,64,310-->

Note that {@{any configuration of an impartial game can therefore be written as a single position}@}, because {@{the moves will be the same no matter whose turn it is}@}. For example, {@{the position of the _zero game_ can simply be written $\{\}$}@}, because if {@{it's Alice's turn, she has no moves to make, and if it's Bob's turn, he has no moves to make either}@}. A move can be {@{associated with the position it leaves the next player in}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-13,62,310!2025-02-13,39,290!2025-03-08,58,310!2025-03-06,56,310!2025-03-13,62,310-->

Doing so {@{allows positions to be defined recursively}@}. For example, consider {@{the following game of Nim}@} played by Alice and Bob. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,63,310!2025-03-04,54,310-->

### example Nim game

```text
Sizes of heaps  Moves
 A B C
  
 1 2 2           Alice takes 1 from A
 0 2 2           Bob   takes 1 from B
 0 1 2           Alice takes 1 from C
 0 1 1           Bob   takes 1 from B
 0 0 1           Alice takes 1 from C
 0 0 0           Bob   has no moves, so Alice wins
```

- At step 6 of the game \(when {@{all of the heaps are empty}@}\) the position is {@{$\{\}$}@}, because {@{Bob has no valid moves to make}@}. We name {@{this position $*0$}@}.
- At step 5, Alice had exactly one option: to remove one object from heap C, leaving {@{Bob with no moves}@}. Since her _move_ {@{leaves Bob in position $*0$}@}, her _position_ is {@{written $\{*0\}$}@}. We name {@{this position $*1$ (annotation: suspiciously looks like the [von Neumann construction of the natural numbers](set-theoretic%20definition%20of%20natural%20numbers.md) in set theory)}@}.
- At step 4, Bob had two options: {@{remove one from B or remove one from C}@}. Note, however, that {@{it didn't really matter which heap Bob removed the object from}@}: Either way, {@{Alice would be left with exactly one object in exactly one pile}@}. So, using our recursive definition, Bob {@{really only has one move: $*1$}@}. Thus, {@{Bob's position is $\{*1\}$}@}.
- At step 3, Alice had 3 options: {@{remove two from C, remove one from C, or remove one from B}@}. Removing two from C {@{leaves Bob in position $*1$}@}. Removing one from C {@{leaves Bob with two piles, each of size one, i.e., position $\{*1\}$}@}, as described in step 4. However, removing 1 from B would {@{leave Bob with two objects in a single pile}@}. _His_ moves would {@{then be $*0$ and $*1$}@}, so _her_ move would {@{result in the position $\{*0,*1\}$}@}. We call {@{this position $*2$ (annotation: really suspiciously looks like the [von Neumann construction of the natural numbers](set-theoretic%20definition%20of%20natural%20numbers.md) in set theory)}@}. Alice's position is then {@{the set of all her moves: ${\big \{}*1,\{*1\},*2{\big \} }$}@}.
- Following the same recursive logic, at step 2, Bob's position is {@{$${\big \{}\{*1,\{*1\},*2\},*2{\big \} }.$$}@}
- Finally, at step 1, Alice's position is$${\Big \{}{\big \{}*1,\{*1\},*2{\big \} },{\big \{}*2,\{*1,\{*1\},*2\}{\big \} },{\big \{}\{*1\},\{\{*1\}\},\{*1,\{*1\},*2\}{\big \} }{\Big \} }.$$ <!--SR:!2025-03-13,62,310!2025-03-17,65,310!2025-03-11,60,310!2025-03-05,55,310!2025-02-12,39,290!2025-02-23,47,290!2025-05-29,115,290!2025-03-16,64,310!2025-03-18,66,310!2025-05-11,102,290!2025-03-04,54,310!2025-03-11,60,310!2025-03-14,63,310!2025-03-08,58,310!2025-05-08,98,290!2025-02-28,48,290!2025-05-28,114,290!2025-02-15,41,290!2025-03-14,63,310!2025-03-05,55,310!2025-03-17,65,310!2025-03-04,54,310-->

### nimbers

{@{The special names $*0$, $*1$, and $*2$}@} referenced in our example game are {@{called ___[nimbers](nimber.md)___}@}. In general, {@{the nimber $*n$}@} corresponds to {@{the position in a game of nim where there are exactly $n$ objects in exactly one heap}@}. Formally, nimbers are defined {@{inductively as follows: $*0$ is $\{\}$, $*1=\{*0\}$, $*2=\{*0,*1\}$ and for all $n\geq 0$, $*(n+1)=*n\cup \{*n\}$ (annotation: suspiciously looks like the [von Neumann construction of the natural numbers](set-theoretic%20definition%20of%20natural%20numbers.md) in set theory)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-04,54,310!2025-02-18,43,290!2025-03-17,65,310!2025-03-07,57,310!2025-03-04,54,310-->

While {@{the word _nim_<!-- markdown separator -->ber comes from the game _nim_}@}, nimbers can be {@{used to describe the positions of any finite, impartial game}@}, and in fact, the Sprague–Grundy theorem states that {@{every instance of a finite, impartial game can be associated with a _single_ nimber}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-19,67,310!2025-02-22,47,290!2025-02-12,39,290-->

### combining games

Two games can be {@{combined by ___adding___ their positions together}@}. For example, consider {@{another game of nim with heaps $A'$, $B'$, and $C'$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,55,310!2025-02-22,47,290-->

#### example game 2

```text
Sizes of heaps    Moves

A' B' C'
1  1  1           Alice takes 1 from A'
0  1  1           Bob takes one from B'
0  0  1           Alice takes one from C'
0  0  0           Bob has no moves, so Alice wins.
```

We can {@{combine it with our [first example](#example%20Nim%20game)}@} to {@{get a combined game with six heaps: $A$, $B$, $C$, $A'$, $B'$, and $C'$}@}: <!--SR:!2025-03-13,62,310!2025-03-05,55,310-->

#### combined game

```text
Sizes of heaps     Moves
 A  B  C  A' B' C'  
  
 1  2  2  1  1  1   Alice takes 1 from A
 0  2  2  1  1  1   Bob takes 1 from A'
 0  2  2  0  1  1   Alice takes 1 from B'
 0  2  2  0  0  1   Bob takes 1 from C'
 0  2  2  0  0  0   Alice takes 2 from B
 0  0  2  0  0  0   Bob takes 2 from C
 0  0  0  0  0  0   Alice has no moves, so Bob wins.
```

To {@{differentiate between the two games}@}, for the [first example game](#firstExample), we'll {@{label its starting position $\color {blue}S$, and color it blue}@}: $$\color {blue}S={\Big \{}{\big \{}*1,\{*1\},*2{\big \} },{\big \{}*2,\{*1,\{*1\},*2\}{\big \} },{\big \{}\{*1\},\{\{*1\}\},\{*1,\{*1\},*2\}{\big \} }{\Big \} }$$ For the [second example game](#secondExample), we'll {@{label the starting position $\color {red}S'$ and color it red}@}: $$\color {red}S'={\Big \{}\{*1\}{\Big \} }.$$ <!--SR:!2025-03-05,55,310!2025-02-27,47,290!2025-03-17,65,310-->

To {@{compute the starting position of the [combined game](#combined%20game)}@}, remember that {@{a player can either make a move in the first game, leaving the second game untouched, or make a move in the second game, leaving the first game untouched}@}. So {@{the combined game's starting position is}@}: {@{$${\color {blue}S} + {\color {red}S'} = {\Big \{}{\color {blue}S} + {\color {red}\{*1\} } {\Big \} }\cup {\Big \{} {\color {red}S'} + {\color {blue}\{*1,\{*1\},*2\} }, {\color {red}S'} + {\color {blue}\{*2,\{*1,\{*1\},*2\}\} }, {\color {red}S'} + {\color {blue}\{\{*1\},\{\{*1\}\},\{*1,\{*1\},*2\}\} } {\Big \} }$$ (annotation: notice $+$ is used recursively)}@} <!--SR:!2025-03-19,67,310!2025-03-04,54,310!2025-03-07,57,310!2025-02-24,47,290-->

{@{The explicit formula for adding positions}@} is: {@{$S+S'=\{S+s'\mid s'\in S'\}\cup \{s+S'\mid s\in S\}$}@}, which means that {@{addition is both commutative and associative}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-08,58,310!2025-03-04,54,310!2025-03-06,56,310-->

### equivalence

{@{Positions in impartial games}@} fall into {@{two ___outcome classes___}@}: either {@{the next player \(the one whose turn it is\) wins \(an ${\boldsymbol {\mathcal {N} } }$<!-- LaTeX separator -->___- position___\)}@}, or {@{the previous player wins \(a ${\boldsymbol {\mathcal {P} } }$<!-- LaTeX separator -->___- position___\)}@}. So, for example, {@{$*0$ is a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position, while $*1$ is an ${\mathcal {N} }$-position}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,65,310!2025-03-04,54,310!2025-03-16,64,310!2025-03-17,65,310!2025-03-13,62,310-->

{@{Two positions $G$ and $G'$ are ___equivalent___}@} if, {@{no matter what position $H$ is added to them, they are always in the same outcome class}@}. Formally, {@{$G\approx G'$}@} {@{if and only if $\forall H$, $G+H$ is in the same outcome class as $G'+H$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-08,58,310!2025-03-15,63,310!2025-03-18,66,310!2025-03-11,60,310-->

To use our running examples, notice that in {@{both the [first](#example%20Nim%20game) and [second](#example%20game%202) games above}@}, we can show that {@{on every turn, Alice has a move that forces Bob into a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position}@}. Thus, {@{both $\color {blue}S$ and $\color {red}S'$ are ${\mathcal {N} }$-positions}@}. \(Notice that in {@{the combined game}@}, _Bob_ is {@{the player with the ${\mathcal {N} }$-positions}@}. In fact, {@{${\color {blue}S}+{\color {red}S'}$ is a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position}@}, which {@{as we will see in Lemma 2, means ${\color {blue}S} \approx {\color {red}S'}$}@}.\) <!--SR:!2025-02-23,47,290!2025-05-12,103,290!2025-03-08,58,310!2025-03-19,67,310!2025-03-15,63,310!2025-03-06,56,310!2025-03-18,66,310-->

## First Lemma

As {@{an intermediate step to proving the main theorem}@}, we show that {@{for every position $G$ and every ${\mathcal {P} }$-position $A$}@}, {@{the equivalence $G\approx A+G$ holds}@}. By {@{the above definition of equivalence}@}, this amounts to {@{showing that $G+H$ and $A+G+H$ share an outcome class for all $H$ (annotation: That $G$ is separated into $G + H$ is mostly irrelevant for proving Lemma 1. It is more for matching the definition, and will be used in Lemma 2 instead.)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-06,56,310!2025-03-09,58,310!2025-03-14,63,310!2025-03-13,62,310!2025-03-06,56,310-->

Suppose that {@{$G+H$ is a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position}@}. Then {@{the previous player has a winning strategy for $A+G+H$}@}: respond to {@{moves in $A$ according to their winning strategy for $A$ \(which exists by virtue of $A$ being a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position\)}@}, and respond to {@{moves in $G+H$ according to their winning strategy for $G+H$ \(which exists for the analogous reason\)}@}. So {@{$A+G+H$ must also be a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,66,310!2025-03-07,57,310!2025-04-15,76,270!2025-03-05,55,310!2025-03-12,61,310-->

On the other hand, if {@{$G+H$ is an ${\mathcal {N} }$-position}@}, then {@{$A+G+H$ is also an ${\mathcal {N} }$-position}@}, because {@{the next player has a winning strategy}@}: choose {@{a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position from among the $G+H$ options}@}, and we conclude {@{from the previous paragraph that adding $A$ to that position is still a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position (annotation: and in this context, the previous player refers to the next player before choosing a $\mathcal P$-position from $G + H$)}@}. Thus, {@{in this case, $A+G+H$ must be a ${\mathcal {N} }$-position, just like $G+H$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,64,310!2025-03-12,61,310!2025-03-15,52,250!2025-02-22,47,290!2025-04-15,76,270!2025-03-14,63,310-->

As {@{these are the only two cases}@}, {@{the lemma holds}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-17,43,290!2025-02-16,42,290-->

## Second Lemma

As a further step, we show that {@{$G\approx G'$ if and only if $G+G'$ is a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,63,310-->

In the forward direction, suppose that {@{$G\approx G'$}@}. Applying {@{the definition of equivalence with $H=G$}@}, we find that {@{$G'+G$ \(which is equal to $G+G'$ by [commutativity](commutative%20property.md) of addition\) is in the same outcome class as $G+G$}@}. But {@{$G+G$ must be a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position}@}: {@{for every move made in one copy of $G$, the previous player can respond with the same move in the other copy}@}, and {@{so always make the last move}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-14,79,270!2025-03-10,59,310!2025-02-23,47,290!2025-03-19,67,310!2025-02-22,47,290!2025-03-18,66,310-->

In the reverse direction, since {@{$A=G+G'$ is a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position by hypothesis}@}, it {@{follows from the first lemma, $G\approx G+A$, that $G\approx G+(G+G')$}@}. Similarly, since {@{$B=G+G$ is also a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position}@}, it {@{follows from the first lemma in the form $G'\approx G'+B$ that $G'\approx G'+(G+G)$}@}. By {@{[associativity](associative%20property.md) and commutativity}@}, {@{the right-hand sides of these results are equal}@}. Furthermore, {@{$\approx$ is an [equivalence relation](equivalence%20relation.md)}@} because {@{equality is an equivalence relation on outcome classes}@}. Via {@{the [transitivity](transitive%20relation.md) of $\approx$}@}, we can {@{conclude that $G\approx G'$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-11,100,290!2025-02-11,38,290!2025-02-23,47,290!2025-03-21,55,250!2025-03-09,58,310!2025-02-18,43,290!2025-03-15,63,310!2025-02-18,43,290!2025-03-10,59,310!2025-03-15,63,310-->

## proof of the theorem

We prove that {@{all positions are equivalent to a nimber by [structural induction](structural%20induction.md)}@}. The more specific result, that {@{the given game's initial position must be equivalent to a nimber}@}, shows {@{that the game is itself equivalent to a nimber}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-10,59,310!2025-03-05,55,310!2025-03-14,63,310-->

Consider {@{a position $G=\{G_{1},G_{2},\ldots ,G_{k}\}$}@}. By {@{the [induction hypothesis](mathematical%20induction.md)}@}, {@{all of the options are equivalent to nimbers, say $G_{i}\approx *n_{i}$}@}. So let {@{$G'=\{*n_{1},*n_{2},\ldots ,*n_{k}\}$}@}. We will show that {@{$G\approx *m$, where $m$ is the [mex \(minimum exclusion\)](mex%20(mathematics).md) of the numbers $n_{1},n_{2},\ldots ,n_{k}$}@}, that is, {@{the smallest non-negative integer not equal to some $n_{i}$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,65,310!2025-03-13,62,310!2025-02-23,47,290!2025-02-12,39,290!2025-03-15,63,310!2025-03-18,66,310-->

The first thing we need to note is that {@{$G\approx G'$, by way of the second lemma}@}. If {@{$k$ is zero, the claim is trivially true}@}. Otherwise, {@{consider $G+G'$}@}. If {@{the next player makes a move to $G_{i}$ in $G$, then the previous player can move to $*n_{i}$ in $G'$, and conversely if the next player makes a move in $G'$}@}. After this, {@{the position is a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position by the lemma's forward implication}@}. Therefore, {@{$G+G'$ is a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position}@}, and, {@{citing the lemma's reverse implication, $G\approx G'$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-11,60,310!2025-03-11,60,310!2025-03-18,66,310!2025-03-25,58,250!2025-03-23,57,250!2025-03-04,54,310!2025-05-08,99,290-->

Now let us show that {@{$G'+*m$ is a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position}@}, which, {@{using the second lemma once again, means that $G'\approx *m$}@}. We do so by {@{giving an explicit strategy for the previous player}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-12,61,310!2025-05-01,87,270!2025-02-23,47,290-->

Suppose that {@{$G'$ and $*m$ are empty}@}. Then {@{$G'+*m$ is the null set, clearly a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,63,310!2025-03-07,57,310-->

Or {@{consider the case that the next player moves in the component $*m$ to the option $*m'$ where $m'<m$ (annotation: $m' < m$ is used instead of $*m' < *m$ because numbers but not games can be compared)}@}. Because {@{$m$ was the _minimum_ excluded number}@}, {@{the previous player can move in $G'$ to $*m'$}@}. And, as shown before, {@{any position plus itself is a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position}@}. (annotation: {@{The other case $m' > m$ is impossible by the definition of nimbers.}@}) <!--SR:!2025-05-01,84,270!2025-06-15,127,290!2025-02-13,39,290!2025-02-21,43,290!2025-03-15,66,326-->

Finally, suppose instead that {@{the next player moves in the component $G'$ to the option $*n_{i}$}@}. If {@{$n_{i}<m$ (annotation: $n_i < m$ is used instead of $*n_i < *m$ because numbers but not games can be compared) then the previous player moves in $*m$ to $*n_{i}$}@}; otherwise, if {@{$n_{i}>m$, the previous player moves in $*n_{i}$ to $*m$}@}; in either case {@{the result is a position plus itself}@}. \(It is not possible that {@{$n_{i}=m$ because $m$ was defined to be different from all the $n_{i}$}@}.\) <!--SR:!2025-03-09,58,310!2025-03-16,64,310!2025-03-09,58,310!2025-03-19,67,310!2025-03-29,67,270-->

In summary, we have {@{$G\approx G'$ and $G'\approx *m$}@}. By {@{transitivity}@}, we {@{conclude that $G\approx *m$, as desired}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-09,58,310!2025-03-07,57,310!2025-03-05,55,310-->

## development

If {@{$G$ is a position of an impartial game}@}, {@{the unique integer $m$ such that $G\approx *m$}@} is called {@{its Grundy value, or Grundy number}@}, and {@{the function that assigns this value to each such position}@} is called {@{the Sprague–Grundy function}@}. {@{R. L. Sprague and P. M. Grundy}@} {@{independently gave an explicit definition of this function, not based on any concept of equivalence to nim positions}@}, and {@{showed that it had the following properties}@}: <!--SR:!2025-02-22,47,290!2025-03-04,54,310!2025-03-12,61,310!2025-02-23,47,290!2025-03-05,55,310!2025-04-15,76,270!2025-02-21,43,290!2025-03-19,67,310-->

- The Grundy value of a single nim pile of size $m$ \(i.e. of the position $*m$\) ::@:: is $m$; <!--SR:!2025-03-13,62,310!2025-03-10,59,310-->
- A position is a loss for the next player to move \(i.e. a ${\mathcal {P} }$-position\) ::@:: if and only if its Grundy value is zero; and <!--SR:!2025-02-26,46,290!2025-03-15,63,310-->
- The Grundy value of the sum of a finite set of positions is ::@:: just the [nim-sum](nimber.md#addition) of the Grundy values of its summands. <!--SR:!2025-03-16,64,310!2025-03-12,61,310-->

It follows {@{straightforwardly from these results}@} that if {@{a position $G$ has a Grundy value of $*m$}@}, then {@{$G+H$ has the same Grundy value as $*m+H$}@}, and therefore {@{belongs to the same outcome class, for any position $H$}@}. Thus, although {@{Sprague and Grundy never explicitly stated the theorem described in this article}@}, it {@{follows directly from their results and is credited to them}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup><sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> These results have {@{subsequently been developed into the field of [combinatorial game theory](combinatorial%20game%20theory.md)}@}, notably by {@{[Richard Guy](Richard%20K.%20Guy.md), [Elwyn Berlekamp](Elwyn%20Berlekamp.md), [John Horton Conway](John%20Horton%20Conway.md) and others}@}, where they are now {@{encapsulated in the Sprague–Grundy theorem and its proof in the form described here}@}. The field is presented in the books {@{_[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays](Winning%20Ways%20for%20Your%20Mathematical%20Plays.md)_ and _[On Numbers and Games](On%20Numbers%20and%20Games.md)_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,57,310!2025-03-04,54,310!2025-03-15,63,310!2025-02-13,39,290!2025-03-17,65,310!2025-03-12,61,310!2025-03-13,62,310!2025-02-16,42,290!2025-02-22,47,290!2025-02-21,43,290-->
