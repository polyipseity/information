# iron(III) oxide-hydroxide

__Iron(III) oxide-hydroxide__ is {@{an [inorganic compound](inorganic%20compound.md) with the [chemical formula](chemical%20formula.md) [Fe](iron.md)[O](oxygen.md)([OH](hydroxide.md))}@}. It looks like {@{reddish brown [crystals](crystal.md)}@}.

It is often seen as {@{one of its [hydrates](hydrate.md), FeO(OH)·_n_[H<sub>2</sub>O](water.md)}@}. The {@{monohydrate FeO(OH)·H<sub>2</sub>O is often called __iron(III) hydroxide__ Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>}@}.

## preparation

Treating {@{iron(III) [salts](salt%20(chemistry).md) with a [base](base%20(chemistry).md) [precipitates](precipitate.md) out reddish brown iron(III) hydroxide}@}:
