# gains from trade

In [economics](economics.md), __gains from trade__ are {@{the net benefits to [economic agents](agent%20(economics).md) from being allowed an increase in voluntary [trading](trade.md) with each other}@}. In technical terms, they are {@{the increase of [consumer surplus](economic%20surplus.md#consumer%20surplus)<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> plus [producer surplus](economic%20surplus.md#producer%20surplus)<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> from lower [tariffs](tariff.md)<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> or otherwise [liberalizing trade](free%20trade.md)}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-04-20,107,290!2025-01-16,47,290-->

## dynamics

Gains from trade are commonly described as resulting from:

- specialization in ::@:: production from [division of labor](division%20of%20labour.md), [economies of scale](economies%20of%20scale.md), [scope](economies%20of%20scope.md), and [agglomeration](economies%20of%20agglomeration.md)<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> and relative availability of [factor resources](factors%20of%20production.md) in types of output by farms, businesses, location<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> and [economies](economy.md) <!--SR:!2025-03-04,73,270!2025-04-06,105,290-->
- a resulting increase in ::@:: total [output possibilities](production–possibility%20frontier.md) <!--SR:!2025-01-25,55,310!2025-02-07,66,310-->
- trade through ::@:: [markets](market%20(economics).md) from sale of one type of output for other, more highly valued goods.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-01-06,39,290!2025-02-04,63,310-->

{@{Market incentives, such as reflected in [prices](price.md) of outputs and inputs}@}, are theorized to {@{attract [factors of production](factors%20of%20production.md), including labor}@}, into {@{activities according to [comparative advantage](comparative%20advantage.md)}@}, that is, for which {@{they each have a low [opportunity cost](opportunity%20cost.md)}@}. The factor owners then {@{use their increased income from such specialization}@} to {@{buy more-valued [goods](goods.md) of which they would otherwise be high-cost producers}@}, hence {@{their _gains from trade_}@}. The concept may be applied to {@{an entire economy for the alternatives of [autarky](autarky.md) (no trade) or trade}@}. {@{A measure of total gains from trade}@} is {@{the sum of [consumer surplus](economic%20surplus.md#consumer%20surplus) and producer [profits](profit%20(economics).md)}@} or, more roughly, {@{the increased output from specialization in production with resulting trade}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> Gains from trade may also refer to {@{net benefits to a country from lowering barriers to trade such as [tariffs](tariff.md) on [imports](import.md)}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-04,63,310!2025-06-09,156,310!2025-04-24,110,290!2025-01-24,54,310!2025-02-04,63,310!2025-01-09,39,290!2025-01-26,56,310!2025-02-04,63,310!2025-02-04,63,310!2025-01-11,41,290!2025-01-12,42,290!2025-02-07,66,310-->

{@{[David Ricardo](David%20Ricardo.md) in 1817}@} first {@{clearly stated and proved the principle of comparative advantage}@},<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> termed {@{a "fundamental analytical explanation" for the source of gains from trade}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> But from {@{publication of [Adam Smith](Adam%20Smith.md)'s _[The Wealth of Nations](The%20Wealth%20of%20Nations.md)_ in 1776}@}, it was widely argued, that, with {@{competition and absent market [distortions](market%20distortion.md)}@}, such gains are {@{positive in moving toward [free trade](free%20trade.md) and away from autarky or prohibitively high import [tariffs](tariff.md)}@}. {@{Rigorous early contemporary statements of the conditions under which this proposition holds}@} are found in {@{Samuelson in 1939 and 1962}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> For {@{the analytically tractable general case of [Arrow-Debreu goods](Arrow–Debreu%20model.md)}@}, {@{formal proofs came in 1972}@} for {@{determining the condition of no losers in moving from autarky toward free trade}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-01-13,44,290!2025-01-27,57,310!2025-02-06,65,310!2025-03-10,76,270!2025-02-04,63,310!2025-02-08,67,310!2025-02-04,63,310!2025-01-21,44,250!2025-01-15,46,290!2025-03-03,76,270!2025-01-07,40,290-->

The proof does not state that {@{no involvement is the best economic outcome}@}. Rather, {@{a large economy might be able to set taxes and subsidies to its benefit at the expense of other economies}@}. {@{Later results of Kemp and others}@} showed that in {@{an Arrow-Debreu world with a system of [lump-sum](lump-sum%20tax.md) compensatory mechanisms}@}, corresponding to {@{a [customs union](customs%20union.md) for a given subset set of countries (described by free trade among a group of economies and a common set of tariffs)}@}, there is {@{a common set of _world_ tariffs such that no country would be worse off than in the smaller customs union}@}. The suggestion is that if {@{a customs union has advantages for an economy}@}, there is {@{a worldwide customs union that is at least as good for each country in the world}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-08,67,310!2025-01-28,58,310!2025-02-08,67,310!2025-01-06,39,290!2025-02-06,65,310!2025-02-04,63,310!2025-01-12,43,290!2025-01-09,39,290-->
