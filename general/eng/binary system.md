# binary system

A __binary system__ is {@{a system of two [astronomical bodies](astronomical%20object.md) of the same kind that are comparable in size}@}. Definitions {@{vary, but typically require the [center of mass](center%20of%20mass.md) ([barycenter](barycenter%20(astronomy).md)) to be located outside of either object}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-23,280,330!2028-08-04,1143,350-->

## classification

Binary systems can also be classified based on {@{how we see them}@}. {@{__Visual binaries__}@} are two objects {@{separate enough that they can be distinguished through binoculars or a small telescope}@}. {@{__Eclipsing binaries__}@} are two objects {@{that have an [orbit](orbit.md) inclined such that when one passes in front of another other, an [eclipse](eclipse.md) is seen from [Earth](Earth.md)}@}. They also periodically undergo {@{a dip in its light curve when an eclipse happens}@}. {@{__Spectroscopic binaries__}@} are two objects {@{that can have its binary nature detected using spectroscopy (e.g. [Doppler effect](Doppler%20effect.md))}@} <!--SR:!2028-02-21,1010,350!2027-01-13,686,330!2027-11-16,908,330!2028-10-30,1207,350!2025-08-09,296,330!2025-08-17,301,330!2027-02-11,707,330!2026-01-26,410,310-->
