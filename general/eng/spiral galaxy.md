# spiral galaxy

__Spiral galaxies__ (denoted {@{S or SB for [barred](barred%20spiral%20galaxy.md)}@}) form {@{a [class of galaxy](galaxy%20morphological%20classification.md) originally described by [Edwin Hubble](Edwin%20Hubble.md) in his 1936 work _The Realm of the Nebulae_}@} and, as such, form part of {@{the [Hubble sequence](Hubble%20sequence.md)}@}. Most spiral galaxies consist {@{of a flat, rotating [disk](galactic%20disc.md) containing [stars](star.md), [gas and dust](interstellar%20medium.md), and a central concentration of stars known as the [bulge](galactic%20bulge.md)}@}. These are often surrounded by {@{a much fainter [halo](galactic%20halo.md) of stars, many of which reside in [globular clusters](globular%20cluster.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-21,271,330!2025-03-08,144,270!2025-10-26,320,290!2025-11-16,332,290!2025-12-06,363,310-->
