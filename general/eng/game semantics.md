{@{__Game semantics__}@} is {@{an approach to [formal semantics](formal%20semantics%20(logic).md)}@} that grounds {@{the concepts of [truth](truth.md) or [validity](validity%20(logic).md) on [game-theoretic](game%20theory.md) concepts}@}, such as {@{the existence of a [winning strategy](winning%20strategy.md#winning%20strategies) for a player}@}. In {@{this framework}@}, {@{logical formulas}@} are {@{interpreted as defining games between two players}@}. The term encompasses {@{several related but distinct traditions}@}, including {@{[dialogical logic](dialogical%20logic.md) \(developed by [Paul Lorenzen](Paul%20Lorenzen.md) and [Kuno Lorenz](Kuno%20Lorenz.md) in Germany starting in the 1950s\)}@} and {@{game-theoretical semantics \(developed by [Jaakko Hintikka](Jaakko%20Hintikka.md) in Finland\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-30,250,330!2026-07-08,233,330!2026-09-08,282,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2025-12-02,67,310!2025-12-01,66,310!2026-09-05,280,330!2026-09-04,279,330!2026-07-10,235,330!2026-08-26,272,330-->

Game semantics represents {@{a significant departure from traditional [model-theoretic](model%20theory.md) approaches}@} by emphasizing {@{the dynamic, interactive nature of logical reasoning}@} rather than {@{static truth assignments}@}. It provides {@{intuitive interpretations for various logical systems}@}, including {@{[classical logic](classical%20logic.md), [intuitionistic logic](intuitionistic%20logic.md), [linear logic](linear%20logic.md), and [modal logic](modal%20logic.md)}@}. The approach bears {@{conceptual resemblances}@} to {@{ancient [Socratic dialogues](Socratic%20dialogues.md), medieval [theory of Obligationes](theory%20of%20Obligationes.md), and [constructive mathematics](constructive%20mathematics.md#constructive%20mathematics)}@}. Since {@{the 1990s, game semantics}@} has found important applications in {@{[theoretical computer science](theoretical%20computer%20science.md)}@}, particularly in {@{the semantics of [programming languages](programming%20language.md), [concurrency theory](concurrency%20theory.md#theory), and the study of [computational complexity](computational%20complexity.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-01,66,310!2026-09-07,281,330!2026-08-29,275,330!2026-08-24,271,330!2026-08-23,270,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-08-28,274,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2025-12-02,67,310-->

## history

In the late 1950s [Paul Lorenzen](Paul%20Lorenzen.md) was the first to introduce a game semantics for [logic](logic.md), and it was further developed by [Kuno Lorenz](Kuno%20Lorenz.md). At almost the same time as Lorenzen, [Jaakko Hintikka](Jaakko%20Hintikka.md) developed a [model-theoretical](model%20theory.md) approach known in the literature as _GTS_ \(game-theoretical semantics\). Since then, a number of different game semantics have been studied in logic.

Shahid Rahman \([Lille III](Charles%20de%20Gaulle%20University%20–%20Lille%20III.md)\) and collaborators developed [dialogical logic](dialogical%20logic.md) into a general framework for the study of logical and philosophical issues related to [logical pluralism](logical%20pluralism.md). Beginning 1994 this triggered a kind of renaissance with lasting consequences. This new philosophical impulse experienced a parallel renewal in the fields of [theoretical computer science](theoretical%20computer%20science.md), [computational linguistics](computational%20linguistics.md), [artificial intelligence](artificial%20intelligence.md), and the [formal semantics of programming languages](formal%20semantics%20of%20programming%20languages.md), for instance the work of [Johan van Benthem](Johan%20van%20Benthem%20(logician).md) and collaborators in [Amsterdam](Amsterdam.md) who looked thoroughly at the interface between logic and games, and Hanno Nickau who addressed the full abstraction problem in programming languages by means of games. New results in [linear logic](linear%20logic.md) by [Jean-Yves Girard](Jean-Yves%20Girard.md) in the interfaces between mathematical game theory and [logic](logic.md) on one hand and [argumentation theory](argumentation%20theory.md) and logic on the other hand resulted in the work of many others, including [S. Abramsky](Samson%20Abramsky.md), J. van Benthem, [A. Blass](Andreas%20Blass.md), [D. Gabbay](Dov%20Gabbay.md), [M. Hyland](Martin%20Hyland.md), [W. Hodges](Wilfred%20Hodges.md), R. Jagadeesan, [G. Japaridze](Giorgi%20Japaridze.md), E. Krabbe, L. Ong, H. Prakken, G. Sandu, D. Walton, and J. Woods, who placed game semantics at the center of a new concept in logic in which logic is understood as a dynamic instrument of inference. There has also been an alternative perspective on [proof theory](proof%20theory.md) and meaning theory, advocating that [Wittgenstein](Wittgenstein.md)'s "meaning as use" paradigm as understood in the context of proof theory, where the so-called reduction rules \(showing the effect of elimination rules on the result of introduction rules\) should be seen as appropriate to formalise the explanation of the \(immediate\) consequences one can draw from a proposition, thus showing the function/purpose/usefulness of its main connective in the calculus of language \([de Queiroz \(1988\)](#CITEREFde%20Queiroz1988), [de Queiroz \(1991\)](#CITEREFde%20Queiroz1991), [de Queiroz \(1994\)](#CITEREFde%20Queiroz1994), [de Queiroz \(2001\)](#CITEREFde%20Queiroz2001), [de Queiroz \(2008\)](#CITEREFde%20Queiroz2008), [de Queiroz \(2023\)](#CITEREFde%20Queiroz2023)\).

## classical logic

{@{The simplest application}@} of game semantics is to {@{[propositional logic](propositional%20logic.md)}@}. {@{Each [formula](formula%20(logic).md) of this language}@} is interpreted as {@{a game between two players}@}, known as {@{the "Verifier" and the "Falsifier"}@}. {@{The Verifier}@} is given {@{"ownership" of all the [disjunctions](disjunction.md) in the formula}@}, and {@{the Falsifier}@} is likewise given {@{ownership of all the [conjunctions](logical%20conjunction.md)}@}. {@{Each move of the game}@} consists of {@{allowing the owner of the principal connective to pick one of its branches}@}; play will then {@{continue in that subformula}@}, with {@{whichever player controls its principal connective making the next move}@}. {@{Play ends}@} when {@{a primitive proposition has been so chosen by the two players}@}; at this point {@{the Verifier is deemed the winner}@} if {@{the resulting proposition is true}@}, and {@{the Falsifier is deemed the winner}@} if {@{it is false}@}. {@{The original formula will be considered true}@} precisely when {@{the Verifier has a [winning strategy](winning%20strategy.md#winning%20strategies)}@}, while {@{it will be false}@} whenever {@{the Falsifier has the winning strategy}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-28,250,330!2026-09-08,282,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2026-08-17,265,330!2026-08-30,276,330!2026-08-27,273,330!2026-08-24,269,330!2026-08-28,273,330!2026-08-25,270,330!2026-09-07,281,330!2026-07-26,248,330!2026-08-25,272,330!2026-07-13,237,330!2026-08-06,256,330!2026-08-04,255,330!2026-07-11,236,330!2026-09-09,283,330!2026-08-01,253,330!2026-07-21,244,330!2026-08-03,255,330!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-09-03,278,330!2026-07-31,252,330-->

If {@{the formula}@} contains {@{negations or implications}@}, {@{other, more complicated, techniques}@} may be used. For example, {@{a [negation](negation.md) should be true}@} if {@{the thing negated is false}@}, so it must have the effect of {@{interchanging the roles of the two players}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-04,255,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-09-01,276,330!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-07-22,245,330-->

More generally, game semantics may be applied to {@{[predicate logic](predicate%20logic.md)}@}; {@{the new rules}@} allow {@{a principal [quantifier](quantifier%20(logic).md) to be removed by its "owner"}@} \({@{the Verifier for [existential quantifiers](existential%20quantifier.md) and the Falsifier for [universal quantifiers](universal%20quantifier.md)}@}\) and {@{its [bound variable](bound%20variable.md)}@} replaced {@{at all occurrences by an object of the owner's choosing}@}, drawn from {@{the domain of quantification}@}. Note that {@{a single counterexample}@} {@{falsifies a universally quantified statement}@}, and {@{a single example}@} {@{suffices to verify an existentially quantified one}@}. Assuming {@{the [axiom of choice](axiom%20of%20choice.md)}@}, {@{the game-theoretical semantics for classical [first-order logic](first-order%20logic.md)}@} agree with {@{the usual [model-based \(Tarskian\) semantics](first-order%20logic.md#semantics)}@}. For {@{classical first-order logic}@} {@{the winning strategy for the Verifier}@} essentially consists of {@{finding adequate [Skolem functions](Skolem%20function.md) and [witnesses](witness%20(mathematics).md)}@}. For example, if _S_ denotes {@{$\forall x\exists y\,\phi (x,y)$}@} then {@{an [equisatisfiable](equisatisfiable.md) statement for _S_}@} is {@{$\exists f\forall x\,\phi (x,f(x))$}@}. {@{The Skolem function _f_ \(if it exists\)}@} actually codifies {@{a winning strategy for the Verifier of _S_}@} by {@{returning a witness}@} for {@{the existential sub-formula for every choice of _x_ the Falsifier might make}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-08-23,268,330!2026-09-01,276,330!2026-08-04,255,330!2026-09-05,280,330!2026-08-04,255,330!2026-09-02,277,330!2026-07-23,246,330!2026-08-29,275,330!2026-09-07,281,330!2026-08-04,255,330!2026-09-02,277,330!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-08-11,260,330!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-08-29,274,330!2026-07-14,238,330!2026-07-09,234,330!2026-08-21,268,330!2026-08-04,255,330!2026-09-01,276,330!2026-08-18,266,330!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-09-11,285,330-->

The above definition was first formulated by {@{Jaakko Hintikka as part of his GTS interpretation}@}. {@{The original version of game semantics}@} for {@{classical \(and intuitionistic\) logic due to Paul Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz}@} was {@{not defined in terms of models but of winning strategies over _formal dialogues_}@} \(P. Lorenzen, K. Lorenz 1978, S. Rahman and L. Keiff 2005\). {@{Shahid Rahman and Tero Tulenheimo developed an algorithm}@} to {@{convert GTS-winning strategies for classical logic}@} into {@{the dialogical winning strategies and vice versa}@}. <!--SR:!2026-09-03,278,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2026-09-08,282,330!2026-09-03,278,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2026-08-29,274,330!2026-08-07,257,330-->

{@{Formal dialogues and GTS games}@} may be {@{infinite}@} and use {@{end-of-play rules}@} rather than {@{letting players decide when to stop playing}@}. {@{Reaching this decision}@} by {@{standard means for strategic inferences}@} \({@{[iterated elimination of dominated strategies](strategic%20dominance.md#iterated%20elimination%20of%20strictly%20dominated%20strategies%20(IESDS)) or IEDS}@}\) would, in {@{GTS and formal dialogues, be equivalent to solving the [halting problem](halting%20problem.md)}@} and exceeds {@{the reasoning abilities of human agents}@}. GTS {@{avoids this}@} with a rule to {@{test formulas against an underlying model}@}; {@{logical dialogues, with a non-repetition rule}@} \(similar to {@{[threefold repetition](threefold%20repetition.md) in Chess}@}\). {@{Genot and Jacot \(2017\)<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> proved}@} that {@{players with severely [bounded rationality](bounded%20rationality.md)}@} can {@{reason to terminate a play without IEDS}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-07,257,330!2026-09-09,283,330!2026-08-17,265,330!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-07-29,251,330!2026-08-31,276,330!2026-08-19,267,330!2026-08-14,263,330!2026-08-10,259,330!2026-09-11,285,330!2026-07-24,246,330!2026-08-08,258,330!2026-09-11,285,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2025-12-01,66,310!2026-08-25,272,330-->

For {@{most common logics, including the ones above}@}, {@{the games that arise from them}@} have {@{[perfect information](perfect%20information.md)}@}—that is, {@{the two players}@} always {@{know the [truth values](truth%20value.md) of each primitive}@}, and are {@{aware of all preceding moves in the game}@}. However, with the advent of game semantics, {@{logics, such as the [independence-friendly logic](independence-friendly%20logic.md) of Hintikka and Sandu}@}, with {@{a natural semantics}@} in terms of {@{games of imperfect information have been proposed}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-28,274,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2026-08-05,255,330!2026-08-26,271,330!2026-07-12,237,330!2026-07-20,243,330!2026-05-24,192,310!2026-07-27,249,330!2026-07-19,242,330-->

## intuitionistic logic, denotational semantics, linear logic, logical pluralism

{@{The primary motivation for Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz}@} was to find {@{a game-theoretic \(their term was [_dialogical_](dialogical%20logic.md), in German [Dialogische Logik](Dialogische%20Logik.md) \[[de](../deu/Dialogische%20Logik.md)\]\) semantics for [intuitionistic logic](intuitionistic%20logic.md)}@}. {@{[Andreas Blass](Andreas%20Blass.md)<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> was the first}@} to point out connections between {@{game semantics and [linear logic](linear%20logic.md)}@}. This line was further developed by [Samson Abramsky](Samson%20Abramsky.md), [Radhakrishnan Jagadeesan](Radhakrishnan%20Jagadeesan.md), [Pasquale Malacaria](Pasquale%20Malacaria.md) and independently [Martin Hyland](Martin%20Hyland.md) and [Luke Ong](Luke%20Ong.md), who placed {@{special emphasis on compositionality}@}, i.e. the definition of {@{strategies inductively on the syntax}@}. Using {@{game semantics}@}, the authors mentioned above have solved {@{the long-standing problem of defining a [fully abstract](fully%20abstract.md#abstraction) model}@} for {@{the programming language [PCF](Programming%20language%20for%20Computable%20Functions.md)}@}. Consequently, game semantics has led to {@{fully abstract semantic models}@} for {@{a variety of programming languages}@}, and to {@{new semantic-directed methods of [software verification](software%20verification.md)}@} by {@{software [model checking](model%20checking.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-31,251,330!2026-06-07,191,310!2026-08-30,275,330!2026-09-08,282,330!2026-08-22,267,330!2026-08-04,255,330!2026-09-09,283,330!2026-08-26,272,330!2026-07-25,247,330!2026-07-31,252,330!2026-09-10,284,330!2026-09-06,281,330!2026-09-09,283,330-->

[Shahid Rahman](Shahid%20Rahman.md) \[[fr](../fra/Shahid%20Rahman.md)\] and Helge Rückert extended the [dialogical](dialogical%20logic.md) approach to the study of several non-classical logics such as [modal logic](modal%20logic.md), [relevance logic](relevance%20logic.md), [free logic](free%20logic.md) and [connexive logic](connexive%20logic.md). Recently, Rahman and collaborators developed the dialogical approach into a general framework aimed at the discussion of logical pluralism.

## quantifiers

{@{Foundational considerations of game semantics}@} have been more emphasised by [Jaakko Hintikka](Jaakko%20Hintikka.md) and Gabriel Sandu, especially for {@{[independence-friendly logic](independence-friendly%20logic.md)}@} \(IF logic, more recently {@{_information_-friendly logic}@}\), {@{a logic with [branching quantifiers](branching%20quantifier.md)}@}. It was thought that {@{the [principle of compositionality](principle%20of%20compositionality.md) fails}@} for these logics, so that {@{a Tarskian [truth definition](truth%20definition.md) could not provide a suitable semantics}@}. To {@{get around this problem}@}, the quantifiers were {@{given a game-theoretic meaning}@}. Specifically, the approach is {@{the same as in classical propositional logic}@}, except that the players {@{do not always have [perfect information](perfect%20information.md) about previous moves by the other player}@}. {@{[Wilfrid Hodges](Wilfrid%20Hodges.md) has proposed a [compositional semantics](compositional%20semantics.md)}@} and proved it {@{equivalent to game semantics for IF-logics}@}. <!--SR:!2026-09-06,281,330!2026-07-18,241,330!2026-09-07,281,330!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-08-10,259,330!2026-08-01,253,330!2026-08-22,269,330!2026-08-27,272,330!2026-08-09,259,330!2026-08-12,261,330!2025-12-02,67,310!2025-12-02,67,310-->

More recently [Shahid Rahman](Shahid%20Rahman.md) \[[fr](../fra/Shahid%20Rahman.md)\] and the team of dialogical logic in Lille implemented {@{dependences and independences within a dialogical framework}@} by means of {@{a dialogical approach to [intuitionistic type theory](intuitionistic%20type%20theory.md) called _immanent reasoning_}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-08-16,264,330!2026-06-06,192,310-->

## computability logic

{@{[Japaridze](Giorgi%20Japaridze.md)’s [computability logic](computability%20logic.md)}@} is {@{a game-semantical approach to logic in an extreme sense}@}, treating {@{games as targets to be serviced by logic}@} rather than as {@{technical or foundational means for studying or justifying logic}@}. {@{Its starting philosophical point}@} is that logic is meant to be {@{a universal, general-utility intellectual tool}@} for {@{'navigating the real world'}@} and, as such, it should be {@{construed semantically rather than syntactically}@}, because it is semantics that {@{serves as a bridge between real world and otherwise meaningless formal systems \(syntax\)}@}. Syntax is thus {@{secondary}@}, interesting only as much as {@{it services the underlying semantics}@}. From this standpoint, Japaridze has repeatedly {@{criticized the often followed practice of adjusting semantics to some already existing target syntactic constructions}@}, with {@{[Lorenzen](Paul%20Lorenzen.md)'s approach to intuitionistic logic}@} being an example. {@{This line of thought}@} then proceeds to argue that {@{the semantics, in turn, should be a game semantics}@}, because games "offer {@{the most comprehensive, coherent, natural, adequate and convenient mathematical models}@} for {@{the very essence of all 'navigational' activities of agents}@}: {@{their interactions with the surrounding world}@}".<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> Accordingly, {@{the logic-building paradigm adopted by computability logic}@} is to identify {@{the most natural and basic operations on games}@}, treat those {@{operators as logical operations}@}, and then look for {@{sound and complete axiomatizations of the sets of game-semantically valid formulas}@}. On this path {@{a host of familiar or unfamiliar logical operators}@} have {@{emerged in the open-ended language of computability logic}@}, with {@{several sorts of negations, conjunctions, disjunctions, implications, quantifiers and modalities}@}. <!--SR:!2026-09-10,284,330!2026-08-23,270,330!2026-07-10,235,330!2026-08-20,268,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2025-12-01,66,310!2026-08-02,254,330!2026-08-25,270,330!2026-09-05,280,330!2026-08-30,275,330!2026-09-06,281,330!2026-08-05,255,330!2026-08-12,261,330!2026-08-13,262,330!2026-08-27,273,330!2026-07-16,240,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-08-28,273,330!2026-09-10,284,330!2026-08-18,266,330!2026-09-04,279,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-07-11,236,330-->

Games are {@{played between two agents}@}: {@{a machine and its environment}@}, where the machine is {@{required to follow only [computable](computable.md) strategies}@}. This way, games are seen as {@{interactive computational problems}@}, and {@{the machine's winning strategies for them}@} as {@{solutions to those problems}@}. It has been established that {@{computability logic is robust}@} with respect to {@{reasonable variations in the complexity of allowed strategies}@}, which can be brought down as low as {@{[logarithmic space](logarithmic%20space.md) and [polynomial time](polynomial%20time.md#polynomial%20time)}@} \(one {@{does not imply the other in interactive computations}@}\) without {@{affecting the logic}@}. All this explains {@{the name "computability logic"}@} and determines {@{applicability in various areas of computer science}@}. {@{[Classical logic](classical%20logic.md), [independence-friendly logic](independence-friendly%20logic.md)}@} and {@{certain extensions of [linear](linear%20logic.md) and [intuitionistic](intuitionistic%20logic.md) logics}@} turn out to be {@{special fragments of computability logic}@}, obtained merely by {@{disallowing certain groups of operators or atoms}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-07-30,251,330!2026-08-24,269,330!2026-08-15,263,330!2026-07-15,239,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2026-07-16,240,330!2026-07-17,241,330!2026-07-25,247,330!2026-08-31,276,330!2025-12-02,67,310!2026-09-02,277,330!2026-08-24,271,330!2026-09-04,279,330!2025-12-01,66,310!2026-08-06,256,330!2026-08-11,260,330-->
