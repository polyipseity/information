# cosmic distance ladder

The __cosmic distance ladder__ (also known as {@{the __extragalactic distance scale__}@}) is {@{the succession of methods by which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects}@}. {@{A _direct_ distance measurement of an astronomical object}@} is possible only for {@{those objects that are "close enough" (within about a thousand [parsecs](parsec.md)) to Earth}@}. The techniques for determining distances to {@{more distant objects}@} are all based on {@{various measured correlations between methods that work at close distances and methods that work at larger distances}@}. Several methods rely on {@{a standard candle, which is an astronomical object that has a known [luminosity](luminosity.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-07-18,1408,350!2028-01-23,893,290!2029-03-29,1320,350!2026-06-14,505,310!2027-01-05,673,330!2025-12-11,334,270!2026-09-24,583,310-->

## direct measurement

At the base of the ladder are {@{_fundamental_ distance measurements}@}, in which distances are {@{determined directly, with no physical assumptions about the nature of the object in question}@}. The precise measurement of stellar positions is part of {@{the discipline of [astrometry](astrometry.md)}@}. Early fundamental distances—such as {@{the radii of the earth, moon and sun, and the distances between them}@}—were {@{well estimated with very low technology by the ancient Greeks}@}. <!--SR:!2028-05-30,1000,330!2029-02-11,1287,350!2027-07-26,818,330!2027-08-31,851,330!2026-01-06,103,386-->

### astronomical unit

- see: [astronomical unit](astronomical%20unit.md)

Direct distance measurements are based {@{upon the astronomical unit (AU), which is defined as the mean distance between the [Earth](Earth.md) and the [Sun](Sun.md)}@}. [Kepler's laws](Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) provide {@{precise [ratios](ratio.md) of the orbit sizes of objects orbiting the Sun, but provide no measurement of the overall scale of the orbit system}@}. {@{[Radar](radar.md)}@} is used to {@{measure the distance between the orbits of the Earth and of a second body}@}. From {@{that measurement and the ratio of the two orbit sizes}@}, the size of Earth's orbit is {@{calculated}@}. The Earth's orbit is known with an absolute precision of {@{a few meters}@} and a relative precision of {@{a few parts in 100 billion (1×10<sup>−11</sup>)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-01-08,940,330!2026-05-14,435,290!2028-11-17,1215,350!2028-09-04,1108,310!2026-03-23,392,290!2026-03-16,413,310!2028-09-06,1161,350!2026-02-04,365,290-->

Historically, {@{observations of [Venus transits](Transit%20of%20Venus.md#scientific%20interest%20in%20transits)}@} were crucial in determining the AU; in {@{the first half of the 20th century}@}, {@{observations of [asteroids](asteroid.md)}@} were also important. Presently the orbit of Earth is determined with high precision using {@{[radar](radar.md) measurements of distances to Venus and other nearby planets and asteroids, and by tracking interplanetary spacecraft in their orbits around the Sun through the [Solar System](Solar%20System.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-06-04,783,330!2026-06-01,500,310!2026-10-27,616,330!2027-11-20,899,310-->

### parallax

- see: [parallax in astronomy](parallax%20in%20astronomy.md)

The most important fundamental [distance measurements](length%20measurement.md) in [astronomy](astronomy.md) come from {@{trigonometric [parallax](parallax.md), as applied in the _[stellar parallax method](stellar%20parallax.md#method)_}@}. As {@{the Earth orbits the Sun}@}, the position of nearby stars will {@{appear to shift slightly against the more distant background}@}. These shifts are {@{angles in an [isosceles triangle](isosceles%20triangle.md), with 2 [AU](astronomical%20unit.md) (the distance between the extreme positions of Earth's orbit around the Sun) making the base leg of the triangle and the distance to the star being the long equal-length legs}@}. The amount of shift is {@{quite small, even for the nearest stars, measuring 1 [arcsecond](minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc.md) for an object at 1 parsec's distance (3.26 [light-years](light-year.md))}@}, and thereafter {@{decreasing in angular amount as the distance increases}@}. Astronomers usually express distances in {@{units of _[parsecs](parsec.md)_ (parallax arcseconds); light-years are used in popular media}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-31,736,330!2029-05-04,1348,350!2028-05-22,1075,350!2027-05-15,721,330!2026-09-15,531,310!2026-07-11,515,310!2028-08-25,1152,350-->

## standard candles

{@{Almost all astronomical objects used as physical distance indicators}@} belong to {@{a class that has a known brightness}@}. By {@{comparing this known [luminosity](luminosity.md) to an object's observed brightness}@}, the distance to the object can be {@{computed using the [inverse-square law](inverse-square%20law.md)}@}. These objects of known brightness are {@{termed __standard candles__, coined by [Henrietta Swan Leavitt](Henrietta%20Swan%20Leavitt.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-07-10,814,330!2026-04-19,415,290!2025-12-04,332,290!2029-03-04,1303,350!2025-10-22,330,310-->

The brightness of an object can be expressed {@{in terms of its [absolute magnitude](absolute%20magnitude.md)}@}. This quantity is derived from {@{the logarithm of its luminosity as seen from a distance of 10 parsecs}@}. The [apparent magnitude](apparent%20magnitude.md), {@{the magnitude as seen by the observer}@} (an instrument called {@{a [bolometer](bolometer.md)}@} is used), can be measured and {@{used with the absolute magnitude to calculate the distance _d_ to the object in parsecs as follows}@}: {@{$$5 \cdot \log_{10} d = m − M + 5$$ or $$d = 10^{(m − M + 5) / 5}$$}@}, where {@{_m_ is the apparent magnitude, and _M_ the absolute magnitude}@}. For this to be accurate, {@{both magnitudes must be in the same frequency band and there can be no relative motion in the radial direction}@}. {@{Some means of correcting for interstellar [extinction](extinction%20(astronomy).md), which also makes objects appear fainter and more red}@}, is needed, especially if {@{the object lies within a dusty or gaseous region}@}. The difference between an object's absolute and apparent magnitudes is {@{called its [distance modulus](distance%20modulus.md)}@}, and {@{astronomical distances, especially intergalactic ones}@}, are {@{sometimes tabulated in this way}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-07,1268,310!2026-03-24,395,290!2027-07-29,820,330!2027-07-30,821,330!2026-02-16,382,290!2026-08-02,508,310!2029-07-26,1414,350!2026-07-04,490,290!2026-05-31,466,310!2028-05-05,1019,310!2029-02-09,1284,350!2027-10-28,833,290!2025-11-02,320,290-->

## galactic distance indicators

### main sequence fitting

- see: [spectroscopic parallax](spectroscopic%20parallax.md)

When {@{the absolute magnitude for a group of stars}@} is {@{plotted against the [spectral classification](stellar%20classification.md) of the star, in a [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md)}@}, evolutionary patterns are found that {@{relate to the mass, age and composition of the star}@}. In particular, during {@{their hydrogen burning period}@}, stars {@{lie along a curve in the diagram called the [main sequence](main%20sequence.md)}@}. By {@{measuring these properties from a star's spectrum}@}, {@{the position of a main sequence star on the H–R diagram}@} can be determined, and thereby {@{the star's absolute magnitude estimated}@}. A comparison of this value with {@{the apparent magnitude allows the approximate distance to be determined}@}, after {@{correcting for interstellar extinction of the luminosity because of gas and dust}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-27,373,355!2027-04-21,744,335!2025-11-12,362,355!2026-09-26,584,335!2026-12-23,654,335!2027-10-01,812,335!2027-03-05,705,335!2028-05-28,1081,355!2026-01-30,375,315!2028-09-22,1177,355-->

In {@{a gravitationally-bound [star cluster](star%20cluster.md) such as the [Hyades](hyades%20(star%20cluster).md)}@}, the stars {@{formed at approximately the same age and lie at the same distance}@}. This allows {@{relatively accurate main sequence fitting, providing both age and distance determination}@}. <!--SR:!2030-04-11,1641,375!2027-06-23,791,335!2026-03-08,425,315-->

## extragalactic distance indicators

### supernovae

#### type Ia light curves

[Type Ia supernovae](Type%20Ia%20supernova.md) are {@{some of the best ways to determine extragalactic distances}@}. Ia's occur when {@{a binary white dwarf star begins to accrete matter from its companion star}@}. As the white dwarf gains matter, eventually {@{it reaches its [Chandrasekhar limit](Chandrasekhar%20limit.md) of $1.4M_{\odot }$}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-18,1149,355!2026-04-08,427,315!2028-07-31,1116,355-->

Once reached, the star becomes {@{unstable and undergoes a runaway nuclear fusion reaction}@}. Because {@{all Type Ia supernovae explode at about the same mass}@}, {@{their absolute magnitudes are all the same}@}. This makes them {@{very useful as standard candles}@}. All Type Ia supernovae {@{have a standard blue and visual magnitude of $$M_{B}\approx M_{V}\approx -19.3\pm 0.3$$}@}. Therefore, when observing a Type Ia supernova, if {@{it is possible to determine what its peak magnitude was}@}, then {@{its distance can be calculated}@}. It is {@{not intrinsically necessary to capture the supernova directly at its peak magnitude}@}; using {@{the __multicolor light curve shape__ method (__MLCS__)}@}, the shape of the light curve (taken {@{at any reasonable time after the initial explosion}@}) is {@{compared to a family of parameterized curves that will determine the absolute magnitude at the maximum brightness}@}. This method also {@{takes into effect interstellar extinction/dimming from dust and gas}@}. <!--SR:!2026-09-14,579,335!2028-03-26,1031,355!2026-11-04,616,335!2028-10-25,1200,355!2027-06-11,667,315!2027-09-15,881,355!2029-10-21,1506,375!2025-11-11,361,355!2026-05-12,467,315!2027-10-26,915,355!2028-08-18,1073,315!2026-11-29,636,335-->
