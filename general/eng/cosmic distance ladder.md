# cosmic distance ladder

The __cosmic distance ladder__ (also known as {@{the __extragalactic distance scale__}@}) is {@{the succession of methods by which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects}@}. {@{A _direct_ distance measurement of an astronomical object}@} is possible only for {@{those objects that are "close enough" (within about a thousand [parsecs](parsec.md)) to Earth}@}. The techniques for determining distances to {@{more distant objects}@} are all based on {@{various measured correlations between methods that work at close distances and methods that work at larger distances}@}. Several methods rely on {@{a standard candle, which is an astronomical object that has a known [luminosity](luminosity.md)}@}.

## direct measurement

At the base of the ladder are {@{_fundamental_ distance measurements, in which distances are determined directly, with no physical assumptions about the nature of the object in question}@}. The precise measurement of stellar positions is part of {@{the discipline of [astrometry](astrometry.md)}@}. Early fundamental distances—such as {@{the radii of the earth, moon and sun, and the distances between them}@}—were {@{well estimated with very low technology by the ancient Greeks}@}.

### astronomical unit

- see: [astronomical unit](astronomical%20unit.md)

Direct distance measurements are based {@{upon the astronomical unit (AU), which is defined as the mean distance between the [Earth](Earth.md) and the [Sun](Sun.md)}@}. [Kepler's laws](Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) provide {@{precise [ratios](ratio.md) of the orbit sizes of objects orbiting the Sun, but provide no measurement of the overall scale of the orbit system}@}. {@{[Radar](radar.md)}@} is used to {@{measure the distance between the orbits of the Earth and of a second body}@}. From {@{that measurement and the ratio of the two orbit sizes}@}, the size of Earth's orbit is {@{calculated}@}. The Earth's orbit is known with an absolute precision of {@{a few meters}@} and a relative precision of {@{a few parts in 100 billion (1×10<sup>−11</sup>)}@}.

Historically, {@{observations of [Venus transits](Transit%20of%20Venus.md#scientific%20interest%20in%20transits)}@} were crucial in determining the AU; in {@{the first half of the 20th century}@}, {@{observations of [asteroids](asteroid.md)}@} were also important. Presently the orbit of Earth is determined with high precision using {@{[radar](radar.md) measurements of distances to Venus and other nearby planets and asteroids, and by tracking interplanetary spacecraft in their orbits around the Sun through the [Solar System](Solar%20System.md)}@}.

### parallax

- see: [parallax in astronomy](parallax%20in%20astronomy.md)

The most important fundamental [distance measurements](length%20measurement.md) in [astronomy](astronomy.md) come from {@{trigonometric [parallax](parallax.md), as applied in the _[stellar parallax method](stellar%20parallax.md#method)_}@}. As {@{the Earth orbits the Sun}@}, the position of nearby stars will {@{appear to shift slightly against the more distant background}@}. These shifts are {@{angles in an [isosceles triangle](isosceles%20triangle.md), with 2 [AU](astronomical%20unit.md) (the distance between the extreme positions of Earth's orbit around the Sun) making the base leg of the triangle and the distance to the star being the long equal-length legs}@}. The amount of shift is {@{quite small, even for the nearest stars, measuring 1 [arcsecond](minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc.md) for an object at 1 parsec's distance (3.26 [light-years](light-year.md))}@}, and thereafter {@{decreasing in angular amount as the distance increases}@}. Astronomers usually express distances in {@{units of _[parsecs](parsec.md)_ (parallax arcseconds); light-years are used in popular media}@}.

## standard candles

{@{Almost all astronomical objects used as physical distance indicators}@} belong to {@{a class that has a known brightness}@}. By {@{comparing this known [luminosity](luminosity.md) to an object's observed brightness}@}, the distance to the object can be {@{computed using the [inverse-square law](inverse-square%20law.md)}@}. These objects of known brightness are {@{termed __standard candles__, coined by [Henrietta Swan Leavitt](Henrietta%20Swan%20Leavitt.md)}@}.

The brightness of an object can be expressed {@{in terms of its [absolute magnitude](absolute%20magnitude.md)}@}. This quantity is derived from {@{the logarithm of its luminosity as seen from a distance of 10 parsecs}@}. The [apparent magnitude](apparent%20magnitude.md), {@{the magnitude as seen by the observer}@} (an instrument called {@{a [bolometer](bolometer.md)}@} is used), can be measured and {@{used with the absolute magnitude to calculate the distance _d_ to the object in parsecs as follows}@}: {@{$$5 \cdot \log_{10} d = m − M + 5$$ or $$d = 10^{(m − M + 5) / 5}$$}@}, where {@{_m_ is the apparent magnitude, and _M_ the absolute magnitude}@}. For this to be accurate, {@{both magnitudes must be in the same frequency band and there can be no relative motion in the radial direction}@}. {@{Some means of correcting for interstellar [extinction](extinction%20(astronomy).md), which also makes objects appear fainter and more red}@}, is needed, especially if {@{the object lies within a dusty or gaseous region}@}. The difference between an object's absolute and apparent magnitudes is {@{called its [distance modulus](distance%20modulus.md)}@}, and {@{astronomical distances, especially intergalactic ones}@}, are {@{sometimes tabulated in this way}@}.

## galactic distance indicators

### main sequence fitting

- see: [spectroscopic parallax](spectroscopic%20parallax.md)

When {@{the absolute magnitude for a group of stars}@} is {@{plotted against the [spectral classification](stellar%20classification.md) of the star, in a [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md)}@}, evolutionary patterns are found that {@{relate to the mass, age and composition of the star}@}. In particular, during {@{their hydrogen burning period}@}, stars {@{lie along a curve in the diagram called the [main sequence](main%20sequence.md)}@}. By {@{measuring these properties from a star's spectrum}@}, {@{the position of a main sequence star on the H–R diagram}@} can be determined, and thereby {@{the star's absolute magnitude estimated}@}. A comparison of this value with {@{the apparent magnitude allows the approximate distance to be determined}@}, after {@{correcting for interstellar extinction of the luminosity because of gas and dust}@}.

In {@{a gravitationally-bound [star cluster](star%20cluster.md) such as the [Hyades](hyades%20(star%20cluster).md)}@}, the stars {@{formed at approximately the same age and lie at the same distance}@}. This allows {@{relatively accurate main sequence fitting, providing both age and distance determination}@}.

## extragalactic distance indicators

### supernovae

#### type Ia light curves

[Type Ia supernovae](Type%20Ia%20supernova.md) are {@{some of the best ways to determine extragalactic distances}@}. Ia's occur when {@{a binary white dwarf star begins to accrete matter from its companion star}@}. As the white dwarf gains matter, eventually {@{it reaches its [Chandrasekhar limit](Chandrasekhar%20limit.md) of $1.4M_{\odot }$}@}.

Once reached, the star becomes {@{unstable and undergoes a runaway nuclear fusion reaction}@}. Because {@{all Type Ia supernovae explode at about the same mass}@}, {@{their absolute magnitudes are all the same}@}. This makes them {@{very useful as standard candles}@}. All Type Ia supernovae {@{have a standard blue and visual magnitude of $$M_{B}\approx M_{V}\approx -19.3\pm 0.3$$}@}. Therefore, when observing a Type Ia supernova, if {@{it is possible to determine what its peak magnitude was}@}, then {@{its distance can be calculated}@}. It is {@{not intrinsically necessary to capture the supernova directly at its peak magnitude}@}; using {@{the __multicolor light curve shape__ method (__MLCS__)}@}, the shape of the light curve (taken {@{at any reasonable time after the initial explosion}@}) is {@{compared to a family of parameterized curves that will determine the absolute magnitude at the maximum brightness}@}. This method also {@{takes into effect interstellar extinction/dimming from dust and gas}@}.
