# fractional distillation

__Fractional distillation__ {@{is a form of [distillation](distillation.md) that separates a [mixture](mixture.md) into [fractions](fraction%20(chemistry).md)}@}. It {@{heats the mixture to a [temperature](temperature.md) at which some fractions [vaporize](vaporize.md)}@}. It is used when the components have [boiling points](boiling%20point.md) that {@{differ by less than 25 °C (45 °F) under a [pressure](pressure.md) of one [atmosphere](atmosphere%20(unit).md)}@}. Otherwise, {@{[simple distillation](simple%20distillation.md)}@} is used. <!--SR:!2031-01-12,1928,270!2026-08-25,593,190!2026-08-16,813,270!2027-01-22,997,330-->
