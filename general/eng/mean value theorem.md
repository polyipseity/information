# mean value theorem

In [mathematics](mathematics.md), the __mean value theorem__ or __{@{Lagrange}@} theorem__ states that {@{a [curve](curve.md) between two [points](point%20(geometry).md) has at least one point at which its [tangent](tangent.md) to the curve is parallel to the [secant](secant%20line.md) joining the two points}@}. <!--SR:!2029-07-31,1532,330!2028-01-26,1006,290-->

## formal statement

> __mean value theorem__
>
> {@{Given a [function](function%20(mathematics).md) $f$ which is [continuous](continuous%20function.md) on $[a,b]$ and [differentiable](differentiable%20function.md) (more generally, the [limit](limit%20of%20a%20function.md) $\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}h$ exists or equals positive or negative [infinity](infinity.md)) on $(a,b)$, there exists some $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$.}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-16,369,190-->
