# density wave theory

__Density wave theory__ or {@{the __Lin–Shu density wave theory__}@} is {@{a theory proposed by [C.C. Lin](Chia-Chiao%20Lin.md) and [Frank Shu](Frank%20Shu.md) in the mid-1960s to explain the spiral arm structure of [spiral galaxies](spiral%20galaxy.md)}@}. The Lin–Shu theory introduces {@{the idea of long-lived [quasistatic](quasistatic%20process.md) spiral structure (QSSS hypothesis)}@}. In this hypothesis, the spiral pattern {@{rotates with a particular angular frequency (pattern speed)}@}, whereas the stars in the [galactic disk](galactic%20disc.md) {@{orbit at [varying speeds](galaxy%20rotation%20curve.md), which depend on their distance to the [galaxy center](Galactic%20Center.md)}@}. The presence of spiral density waves in galaxies has implications on {@{[star formation](star%20formation.md), since the gas orbiting around the galaxy may be compressed and cause shock waves periodically}@}. Theoretically, the formation of a global spiral pattern is treated as {@{an [instability](hydrodynamic%20stability.md) of the stellar disk caused by the [self-gravity](self-gravitation.md), as opposed to [tidal interactions](tidal%20force.md)}@}. The mathematical formulation of the theory has also been extended to {@{other astrophysical disk systems, such as [Saturn's rings](Rings%20of%20Saturn.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-26,337,290!2025-05-03,168,250!2025-05-20,217,330!2025-08-14,274,290!2025-04-22,185,310!2025-02-22,135,290!2025-07-11,222,270!2025-07-08,260,330-->
