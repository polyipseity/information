# unimodality

In [mathematics](mathematics.md), __unimodality__ means {@{possessing a unique [mode](mode%20(statistics).md)}@}. More generally, unimodality means there is {@{only a single highest value, somehow defined, of some [mathematical object](mathematical%20object.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-12-07,1213,350!2027-04-30,745,330-->

## unimodal probability distribution

In [statistics](statistics.md), a __unimodal probability distribution__ or __unimodal distribution__ is {@{a [probability distribution](probability%20distribution.md) which has a single peak}@}. The term "mode" in this context {@{refers to any peak of the distribution, not just to the strict definition of [mode](mode%20(statistics).md) which is usual in statistics}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-30,465,310!2028-05-05,1044,350-->

If {@{there is a single mode}@}, the distribution function is called {@{"unimodal"}@}. If {@{it has more modes}@} it is {@{"bimodal" (2), "trimodal" (3), etc., or in general, "[multimodal](multimodal%20distribution.md)"}@}. {@{The common [normal distributions](normal%20distribution.md)}@} is unimodal. Other examples of unimodal distributions include {@{[Cauchy distribution](Cauchy%20distribution.md), [Student's _t_-distribution](Student's%20t-distribution.md), [chi-squared distribution](chi-squared%20distribution.md) and [exponential distribution](exponential%20distribution.md)}@}. Among {@{discrete distributions}@}, {@{the [binomial distribution](binomial%20distribution.md) and [Poisson distribution](poisson%20distribution.md)}@} can be seen as unimodal, though {@{for some parameters they can have two adjacent values with the same probability}@}. <!--SR:!2028-06-04,1068,350!2028-11-18,1197,350!2028-12-31,1230,350!2028-08-12,1121,350!2025-09-16,292,330!2026-10-27,574,310!2027-03-01,692,330!2027-03-22,710,330!2029-01-23,1247,350-->
