# book value

In {@{accounting}@}, {@{__book value__}@} is {@{the value of an asset<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> according to its [balance sheet](balance%20sheet.md) account balance}@}. For assets, the value is based on {@{the original cost of the asset less any [depreciation](depreciation.md), [amortization](amortization%20(accounting).md) or [impairment costs](impairment%20cost.md) made against the asset}@}. Traditionally, {@{a company's book value}@} is {@{its total assets<sup>\[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please%20clarify)_\]</sup> minus [intangible assets](intangible%20asset.md) and liabilities}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> However, in practice, {@{depending on the source of the calculation}@}, book value {@{may variably include [goodwill](goodwill%20(accounting).md), [intangible assets](intangible%20asset.md), or both}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> {@{The value inherent in its workforce}@}, part of {@{the [intellectual capital](intellectual%20capital.md) of a company}@}, is {@{always ignored}@}. When {@{intangible assets and goodwill are explicitly excluded}@}, the metric is often {@{specified to be _tangible book value_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-22,240,330!2025-12-02,249,330!2025-12-25,267,330!2026-10-18,479,310!2026-01-01,272,330!2026-01-25,291,330!2025-11-22,241,330!2025-12-25,266,330!2026-01-05,276,330!2026-01-21,288,330!2027-11-04,780,330!2028-01-02,825,330!2026-01-02,273,330-->

In {@{the United Kingdom}@}, {@{the term [net asset value](net%20asset%20value.md)}@} may {@{refer to the book value of a company}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-10,279,330!2028-09-21,1046,350!2025-12-05,251,330-->

## asset book value

{@{An asset's initial book value}@} is {@{its actual cash value or its acquisition cost}@}. {@{Cash assets}@} are {@{recorded or "booked" at actual cash value}@}. Assets such as {@{buildings, land and equipment}@} are {@{valued based on their acquisition cost}@}, which {@{includes the actual cash cost of the asset}@} plus {@{certain costs tied to the purchase of the asset}@}, such as {@{broker fees}@}. {@{Not all purchased items}@} are {@{recorded as assets}@}; {@{incidental supplies}@} are {@{recorded as expenses}@}. Some assets might be {@{recorded as current expenses for tax purposes}@}. An example of this is {@{assets purchased and expensed under [Section 179](section%20179.md) of the U.S. tax code}@}.<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-27,293,330!2025-11-13,233,330!2025-12-31,272,330!2025-12-28,269,330!2026-01-28,294,330!2026-01-07,276,330!2027-03-17,554,310!2026-01-12,280,330!2026-01-02,273,330!2028-01-28,834,330!2026-11-02,491,310!2026-01-04,275,330!2027-10-12,724,290!2026-01-19,103,385!2026-01-19,103,385-->

### depreciable, amortizable and depletable assets

{@{Monthly or annual [depreciation](depreciation.md), [amortization](amortization%20(accounting).md) and [depletion](depletion%20(accounting).md)}@} are used to {@{reduce the book value of assets over time}@} as {@{they are "consumed" or used up in the process of obtaining revenue}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> {@{These non-cash expenses}@} are {@{recorded in the accounting books _after_ a [trial balance](trial%20balance.md) is calculated}@} to {@{ensure that cash transactions have been recorded accurately}@}. Depreciation is used to {@{record the declining value of buildings and equipment over time. Land is not depreciated}@}. Amortization is used to {@{record the declining value of intangible assets such as patents}@}. Depletion is used to {@{record the consumption of natural resources}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-06,252,330!2026-01-18,285,330!2025-12-07,253,330!2026-01-03,274,330!2026-10-24,484,310!2025-11-14,234,330!2026-01-01,272,330!2025-11-14,233,330!2026-01-11,279,330-->

{@{Depreciation, amortization and depletion}@} are recorded as {@{expenses against a [contra account](contra%20account.md#contra%20account)}@}. Contra accounts are used {@{in bookkeeping to record asset and liability valuation changes}@}. {@{_Accumulated depreciation_}@} is {@{a contra-asset account used to record asset depreciation}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-11,231,330!2026-01-11,280,330!2026-01-05,276,330!2026-01-24,290,330!2026-01-03,274,330-->

After {@{the bonds are sold}@}, {@{the book value of Bonds Payable}@} is {@{increased or decreased to reflect the actual amount received in payment for the bonds}@}. If {@{the bonds sell for less than [face value](face%20value.md)}@}, {@{the contra account Discount on Bonds Payable}@} is {@{debited for the difference between the amount of cash received and the face value of the bonds}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-07,253,330!2028-08-29,1026,350!2025-11-27,245,330!2025-11-21,240,330!2028-01-05,828,330!2026-12-02,504,310!2025-11-29,246,330!2027-03-23,556,310!2027-02-22,539,310-->

## net asset value

In {@{the United Kingdom}@}, {@{the term [net asset value](net%20asset%20value.md)}@} may {@{refer to book value}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-03,274,330!2025-11-17,236,330!2026-01-19,286,330-->

{@{A [mutual fund](mutual%20fund.md)}@} is {@{an entity which primarily owns _financial assets_ or [capital assets](capital%20asset.md)}@} such as {@{bonds, stocks and commercial paper}@}. {@{The [net asset value](net%20asset%20value.md) of a mutual fund}@} is {@{the market value of assets owned by the fund minus the fund's liabilities}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> This is {@{similar to shareholders' equity}@}, except {@{the asset valuation is market-based rather than based on acquisition cost}@}. In {@{financial news reporting}@}, {@{the reported net asset value of a mutual fund}@} is {@{the net asset value of a single share in the fund}@}. In {@{the mutual fund's accounting records}@}, the financial assets are {@{recorded at acquisition cost}@}.

Financial assets include {@{stock shares and bonds owned by an individual or company}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> These may be reported on {@{the individual or company balance sheet at cost or at market value}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-31,270,330!2025-11-23,241,330-->

## corporate book value

{@{A company or corporation's book value}@}, as {@{an asset held by a separate economic entity}@}, is {@{the company or corporation's [shareholders' equity](shareholders'%20equity.md)}@}, {@{the acquisition cost of the shares}@}, or {@{the market value of the shares owned by the separate economic entity}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-18,285,330!2025-12-30,269,330!2027-05-18,653,330!2025-12-30,271,330!2026-01-14,282,330-->

A corporation's book value is used {@{in fundamental financial analysis to help determine whether the market value of corporate shares}@} is {@{above or below the book value of corporate shares}@}. {@{Neither market value nor book value}@} is {@{an unbiased estimate of a corporation's value}@}. {@{The corporation's bookkeeping or accounting records}@} {@{do not generally reflect the market value of assets and liabilities}@}, and {@{the market or trade value of the corporation's stock}@} is {@{subject to variations}@}. <!--SR:!2027-11-15,789,330!2025-12-14,257,330!2026-01-04,275,330!2025-11-16,235,330!2026-01-04,275,330!2027-12-27,824,330!2025-11-28,246,330!2026-01-08,277,330-->

## tangible common equity

{@{A variation of book value, [tangible common equity](tangible%20common%20equity.md)}@}, has {@{recently come into use by the U.S. federal government in the valuation of troubled banks}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup><sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> {@{Tangible common equity}@} is calculated as {@{total book value minus [intangible assets](intangible%20asset.md), [goodwill](goodwill%20(accounting).md), and [preferred equity](preferred%20stock.md)}@}, and can thus be {@{considered the most conservative valuation of a company and the best approximation of its value should it be forced to liquidate}@}.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> <!--SR:!2027-12-31,824,330!2027-11-24,798,330!2025-12-08,254,330!2027-05-05,585,310!2026-05-22,369,310-->

Since {@{tangible common equity subtracts preferred equity from the tangible book value}@}, it does {@{a better job estimating what the value of the company is}@} to {@{holders of specifically _common_ stock compared to standard calculations of book value}@}. <!--SR:!2027-12-05,805,330!2025-12-02,249,330!2027-11-18,794,330-->

## stock pricing book value

To {@{clearly distinguish the [market price](market%20value.md) of shares}@} from {@{the core [ownership equity](ownership%20equity.md) or [shareholders' equity](shareholders'%20equity.md)}@}, {@{the term _book value_}@} is often used since it {@{focuses on the values that have been added and subtracted in the accounting books of a business \(assets – liabilities\)}@}. The term is also used to distinguish between {@{the [market price](market%20value.md) of any asset and its accounting value}@} which {@{depends more on [historical cost](historical%20cost.md) and [depreciation](depreciation.md)}@}. It may be {@{used interchangeably with carrying value}@}. While {@{it can be used to refer to the business' total [equity](ownership%20equity.md)}@}, it is most often used: <!--SR:!2026-01-02,273,330!2027-11-06,781,330!2026-01-03,274,330!2025-12-29,270,330!2026-01-05,276,330!2025-11-19,238,330!2025-11-18,237,330!2026-01-02,273,330-->

- As a _per share value_: ::@:: The balance sheet equity value is divided by the number of shares outstanding at the date of the balance sheet \(not the average o/s in the period\). <!--SR:!2026-05-04,338,290!2027-03-21,555,310-->
- As a _diluted per share value_: ::@:: The equity is bumped up by the exercise price of the options, warrants or preferred shares. Then it is divided by the number of shares that has been increased by those added. <!--SR:!2027-05-06,587,310!2025-11-30,247,330-->

### uses of books

1. {@{Book value}@} is used in {@{the [financial ratio](financial%20ratio.md) [price/book](P_B%20ratio.md)}@}. It is {@{a valuation metric that sets the floor for stock prices under a worst-case scenario}@}. When {@{a business is liquidated}@}, the book value is {@{what may be left over for the owners after all the debts are paid}@}. {@{Paying only a price/book = 1}@} means {@{the investor will get all his investment back, assuming assets can be resold at their book value}@}. {@{Shares of capital intensive industries}@} {@{trade at lower price/book ratios}@} because {@{they generate lower earnings per dollar of assets}@}. {@{Business depending on [human capital](human%20capital.md)}@} will {@{generate higher earnings per dollar of assets, so will trade at higher price/book ratios}@}.
2. {@{Book value per share}@} can be used to {@{generate a measure of comprehensive earnings, when the opening and closing values are reconciled}@}. {@{Book Value Per Share, beginning of year – Dividends + Share Issue Premium + Comprehensive EPS = Book Value Per Share, end of year}@}. (annotation: that is, you can {@{use this equation to calculate comprehensive EPS from the beginning and ending book value per share}@})<sup>[\[16\]](#^ref-16)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-26,292,330!2025-12-04,251,330!2025-12-01,248,330!2026-01-09,277,330!2025-12-27,268,330!2026-01-03,274,330!2025-12-03,250,330!2025-11-27,245,330!2025-12-06,252,330!2028-09-16,1042,350!2026-01-09,278,330!2025-12-03,250,330!2026-01-20,287,330!2025-12-31,272,330!2027-01-21,483,270!2028-02-02,838,330-->

### changes are caused by

1. The sale of shares/units by the business ::@:: increases the total book value. Book/sh will increase if the additional shares are issued at a price higher than the pre-existing book/sh. <!--SR:!2027-12-13,812,330!2025-12-26,267,330-->
2. The purchase of its own shares by the business ::@:: will decrease total book value. Book/shares will decrease if more is paid for them than was received when originally issued \(pre-existing book/sh\). <!--SR:!2027-12-22,820,330!2028-02-04,839,330-->
3. Dividends paid out ::@:: will decrease book value and book/sh. <!--SR:!2026-06-07,381,310!2026-01-01,272,330-->
4. {@{Comprehensive earnings/losses}@} will {@{increase/decrease book value and book/sh}@}. {@{Comprehensive earnings, in this case}@}, includes {@{net income from the Income Statement, foreign exchange translation changes to Balance Sheet items}@}, {@{accounting changes applied retroactively, and the [opportunity cost](opportunity%20cost.md) of options exercised}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-22,289,330!2026-01-08,277,330!2026-01-07,276,330!2027-04-01,564,310!2025-12-27,92,290-->

### new share issues and dilution

{@{The issue of more shares}@} {@{does not necessarily decrease the value of the current owner}@}. While {@{it is correct that when the number of shares is doubled}@} {@{the EPS will be cut in half}@}, it is {@{too simple to be the full story}@}. It all depends on {@{how much was paid for the new shares and what return the new capital earns once invested}@}. See the discussion at {@{[stock dilution](stock%20dilution.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-05,276,330!2025-12-30,271,330!2025-11-24,242,330!2025-12-09,255,330!2025-12-01,248,330!2025-11-26,244,330!2025-12-24,266,330-->

### net book value of long term assets

Book value is often {@{used interchangeably with _net book value_ or _carrying value_}@}, which is {@{the original acquisition cost less accumulated [depreciation](depreciation.md), [depletion](depletion%20(accounting).md) or [amortization](amortization%20(accounting).md)}@}. Book value is the term which means {@{the value of the firm as per the books of the company}@}. It is the value {@{at which the assets are valued in the balance sheet of the company as on the given date}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-07,276,330!2025-11-12,232,330!2028-09-08,1035,350!2027-06-03,661,330-->
