## algorithms

### DFS-based linear-time algorithms

{@{Several [algorithms](algorithm.md) based on [depth-first search](depth-first%20search.md)}@} compute {@{strongly connected components in linear time}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,268,337!2027-11-05,816,337-->

- {@{[Kosaraju's algorithm](Kosaraju's%20algorithm.md)}@} uses {@{two passes of depth-first search}@}. The first, in {@{the original graph}@}, is used to {@{choose the order in which the outer loop of the second depth-first search tests vertices for having been visited already and [recursively](recursion.md) explores them if not}@}. The second depth-first search is on {@{the [transpose graph](transpose%20graph.md) (annotation: the transpose graph is the original graph but with all edges reversed) of the original graph}@}, and {@{each recursive exploration finds a single new strongly connected component}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> It is named after {@{[S. Rao Kosaraju](S.%20Rao%20Kosaraju.md)}@}, who {@{described it \(but did not publish his results\) in 1978}@}; {@{[Micha Sharir](Micha%20Sharir.md)}@} later {@{published it in 1981}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup>
- {@{[Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm](Tarjan's%20strongly%20connected%20components%20algorithm.md)}@}, published by {@{[Robert Tarjan](Robert%20Tarjan.md) in 1972}@},<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> performs {@{a single pass of depth-first search}@}. It maintains {@{a [stack](stack%20(abstract%20data%20type).md) of vertices that have been explored by the search but not yet assigned to a component}@}, and calculates {@{"low numbers" of each vertex \(an index number of the highest ancestor reachable in one step from a descendant of the vertex\)}@} which {@{it uses to determine when a set of vertices should be popped off the stack into a new component}@}.
- {@{The [path-based strong component algorithm](path-based%20strong%20component%20algorithm.md)}@} uses {@{a depth-first search, like Tarjan's algorithm, but with two stacks}@}. One of the stacks is used to {@{keep track of the vertices not yet assigned to components, while the other keeps track of the current path in the depth-first search tree}@}. {@{The first linear time version of this algorithm}@} was {@{published by [Edsger W. Dijkstra](Edsger%20W.%20Dijkstra.md) in 1976}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-03-12,328,290!2026-10-09,495,317!2025-11-11,263,337!2026-01-08,259,277!2026-01-05,257,277!2026-10-24,506,317!2026-01-07,258,277!2026-01-06,258,277!2026-04-13,356,297!2027-03-05,601,317!2026-01-26,271,277!2026-12-09,540,317!2026-12-02,544,317!2027-11-26,834,337!2026-06-21,374,297!2026-04-20,360,297!2027-08-26,759,337!2027-06-29,646,317!2026-10-17,500,317!2026-11-07,526,317!2026-05-06,371,297-->

Although {@{Kosaraju's algorithm is conceptually simple}@}, {@{Tarjan's and the path-based algorithm require only one depth-first search rather than two}@}. <!--SR:!2026-11-09,515,317!2027-03-16,612,317-->

### reachability-based algorithms

{@{Previous linear-time algorithms}@} are {@{based on depth-first search which is generally considered hard to parallelize}@}. {@{Fleischer et al.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> in 2000}@} proposed {@{a [divide-and-conquer](divide-and-conquer%20algorithm.md) approach based on [reachability](reachability.md) queries}@}, and such algorithms are usually called {@{reachability-based SCC algorithms}@}. The idea of this approach is to {@{pick a random pivot vertex and apply forward and backward reachability queries from this vertex}@}. The two queries {@{partition the vertex set into 4 subsets: vertices reached by both, either one, or none of the searches}@}. One can show that {@{a strongly connected component has to be contained in one of the subsets}@}. {@{The vertex subset reached by both searches}@} forms {@{a strongly connected component}@}, and {@{the algorithm then recurses on the other 3 subsets}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-10,287,337!2026-01-06,308,337!2026-04-21,360,297!2027-07-14,726,337!2025-11-29,276,330!2027-12-16,832,330!2025-12-17,292,337!2026-11-08,527,317!2026-05-17,380,297!2025-12-05,282,337!2025-12-22,296,337-->

{@{The expected sequential running time of this algorithm}@} is {@{shown to be O\(<!-- markdown separator -->_n_ log _n_<!-- markdown separator -->\), a factor of O\(log _n_<!-- markdown separator -->\) more than the classic algorithms}@}. The parallelism comes from: \(1\) {@{the reachability queries can be parallelized more easily}@} \(e.g. by {@{a [breadth-first search](breadth-first%20search.md) \(BFS\)}@}, and it can be fast if {@{the [diameter](distance%20(graph%20theory).md#diameter) of the graph is small}@}\); and \(2\) {@{the independence between the subtasks in the divide-and-conquer process}@}. This algorithm performs {@{well on real-world graphs}@},<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> but {@{does not have theoretical guarantee on the parallelism}@} \(consider if {@{a graph has no edges}@}, {@{the algorithm requires O\(<!-- markdown separator -->_n_<!-- markdown separator -->\) levels of recursions}@}\). <!--SR:!2025-11-18,269,337!2028-01-23,865,337!2025-12-10,287,337!2025-12-10,287,337!2026-11-21,536,317!2028-01-22,864,337!2028-12-24,1150,350!2025-12-16,291,337!2027-09-18,778,337!2028-03-03,907,337-->

{@{Blelloch et al.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> in 2016}@} shows that if {@{the reachability queries are applied in a random order}@}, {@{the cost bound of O\(<!-- markdown separator -->_n_ log _n_<!-- markdown separator -->\) still holds}@}. Furthermore, the queries then can be {@{batched in a prefix-doubling manner \(i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8 queries\)}@} and {@{run simultaneously in one round}@}. {@{The overall [span](analysis%20of%20parallel%20algorithms.md) of this algorithm}@} is {@{log<sub>2</sub> _n_ reachability queries}@}, which is {@{probably the optimal parallelism that can be achieved using the reachability-based approach}@}. <!--SR:!2028-03-11,902,337!2027-09-11,771,337!2027-12-16,836,337!2027-12-07,829,337!2028-01-16,859,337!2025-12-15,291,337!2027-01-19,573,317!2027-10-07,794,337-->

### generating random strongly connected graphs

{@{Peter M. Maurer}@} describes {@{an algorithm for generating random strongly connected graphs}@},<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> based on {@{a modification of an algorithm for [strong connectivity augmentation](strong%20connectivity%20augmentation.md)}@}, the problem of {@{adding as few edges as possible to make a graph strongly connected}@}. When used in conjunction with {@{the Gilbert or Erdős-Rényi models with node relabelling}@}, the algorithm is capable of {@{generating any strongly connected graph on _n_ nodes, without restriction on the kinds of structures that can be generated}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-08,260,337!2025-11-16,267,337!2027-10-10,797,337!2027-03-14,610,317!2026-01-07,254,277!2026-05-02,369,297-->

## applications

{@{Algorithms for finding strongly connected components}@} may be used to {@{solve [2-satisfiability](2-satisfiability.md) problems \(systems of Boolean variables with constraints on the values of pairs of variables\)}@}: as {@{[Aspvall, Plass & Tarjan \(1979\)](#CITEREFAspvallPlassTarjan1979) showed}@}, {@{a 2-satisfiability instance is unsatisfiable}@} {@{if and only if there is a variable _v_ such that _v_ and its negation are both contained}@} in the {@{same strongly connected component of the [implication graph](implication%20graph.md) of the instance}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> <!--SR:!2027-09-22,781,337!2026-12-07,539,317!2026-04-12,357,297!2026-01-02,305,337!2027-03-06,602,317!2027-07-04,718,337-->

Strongly connected components are also used to {@{compute the [Dulmage–Mendelsohn decomposition](Dulmage–Mendelsohn%20decomposition.md)}@}, {@{a classification of the edges of a [bipartite graph](bipartite%20graph.md)}@}, according to {@{whether or not they can be part of a [perfect matching](perfect%20matching.md) in the graph}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-06,244,297!2027-08-05,744,337!2026-10-25,517,317-->

## related results

{@{A directed graph is strongly connected}@} {@{if and only if it has an [ear decomposition](ear%20decomposition.md)}@}, {@{a partition of the edges into a sequence of directed paths and cycles}@} such {@{that the first subgraph in the sequence is a cycle}@}, and {@{each subsequent subgraph is either a cycle sharing one vertex with previous subgraphs, or a path sharing its two endpoints with previous subgraphs}@}. <!--SR:!2029-02-11,1194,357!2025-11-13,264,337!2025-11-15,266,337!2026-09-11,484,317!2026-01-02,254,277-->
