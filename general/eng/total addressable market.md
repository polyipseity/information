# total addressable market

## importance

TAM shows {@{the potential of your company to you and investors}@}. Ideally, when calculating TAM, do not {@{make up numbers, but instead use references to data sources}@}. It can be treated as a {@{long-term goal, though unrealistic to reach}@}. <!--SR:!2027-07-29,885,332!2027-04-18,823,332!2028-02-09,1069,352-->

## difference between TAM, SAM, and SOM

{@{Total addressable market (TAM), or total available market}@}, is {@{the annual revenue if 100% share of a selected market is achieved in a selected geographic location}@}, such as {@{not considering competition and travel distance}@}. <!--SR:!2027-05-06,835,332!2028-01-03,978,312!2025-12-27,18,331-->

{@{[Serviceable available market](serviceable%20available%20market.md) (SAM)}@} is {@{the portion of TAM one can reach via our customer channels}@}, such as {@{considering travel distance but not competition}@}. <!--SR:!2030-02-03,1527,310!2025-12-27,18,331!2025-12-27,18,331-->

{@{[Serviceable obtainable market](target%20market.md) (SOM), share of market, or target market}@}, is {@{the portion of SAM one can realistically capture}@}, such as {@{considering competition and travel distance}@}. It is usually {@{much smaller than SAM, like 6% to 10% depending on the number of competitors}@}. <!--SR:!2028-01-11,1043,352!2028-08-20,1163,312!2027-06-12,801,292!2025-12-27,18,331-->
