# total addressable market

## importance

TAM shows {@{the potential of your company to you and investors}@}. Ideally, when calculating TAM, do not {@{make up numbers, but instead use references to data sources}@}. It can be treated as a {@{long-term goal, though unrealistic to reach}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-24,205,312!2027-04-18,823,332!2025-03-07,232,332-->

## difference between TAM, SAM, and SOM

Total addressable market (TAM), or {@{total available market}@}, is {@{the annual revenue if 100% share of a selected market is achieved in a selected geographic location, such as not considering competition and travel distance}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-21,194,312!2025-04-30,241,292-->

[Serviceable available market](serviceable%20available%20market.md) (SAM) is {@{the portion of TAM one can reach via our customer channels, such as considering travel distance but not competition}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-29,379,290-->

[Serviceable obtainable market](target%20market.md) (SOM), {@{share of market, or target market}@}, is {@{the portion of SAM one can realistically capture, such as considering competition and travel distance}@}. It is usually {@{much smaller than SAM, like 6% to 10% depending on the number of competitors}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-03,228,332!2025-06-13,287,292!2025-04-02,211,272-->
