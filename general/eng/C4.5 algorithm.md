# C4.5 algorithm

## algorithm

The algorithm is similar to the [ID3 algorithm](ID3%20algorithm.md), with several changes described below. First, instead of {@{using the [conditional entropy](conditional%20entropy.md) or the [information gain](information%20gain%20(decision%20tree).md) to select the attribute to split on, the [information gain ratio](information%20gain%20ratio.md) $\operatorname{IGR}(T, a)$ is used instead}@}. This {@{penalizes attributes with more possible values}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-05,182,270!2025-02-02,199,270-->
