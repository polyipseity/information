# rust

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../../tools/utility.py.md
```

__Rust__ is {@{a reddish-brown [iron oxide](iron%20oxide.md) consisting of [hydrated](hydrate.md) [iron(III) oxides](iron(III)%20oxide.md) (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>·nH<sub>2</sub>O) and [iron(III) oxide-hydroxide](iron(III)%20oxide-hydroxide.md) (FeO(OH)·nH<sub>2</sub>O) created by [corrosion](corrosion.md) of refined [iron](iron.md)}@}.

## chemical reactions

Rusting of iron begins with {@{the transfer of [electrons](electron.md) from [iron](iron.md) to [oxygen](oxygen.md) in [water](water.md)}@}. It is accelerated by {@{[acids](acid.md) like [acid rain](acid%20rain.md) and [electrolytes](electrolyte.md) like [sodium chloride](sodium%20chloride.md)}@}. It happens faster in {@{stressed areas like bent, scratched, or sharp areas}@}.

First, {@{iron is oxidized to iron(II) ions and oxygen is reduced to [hydroxides](hydroxide.md) in water}@}. The {@{iron(II) ions may be further oxidized by air to iron(III) ions}@}:

> 1. {@{2Fe(s) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) → 2Fe<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 4OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)
>     - O<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + 4e<sup>-</sup> → 4OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)
>     - Fe(s) → Fe<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup>}@}
> 2. {@{4Fe<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 4Fe<sup>3+</sup>(aq) + 2O<sup>2-</sup>(aq)}@}

After forming iron ions, {@{[acid–base reactions](acid–base%20reaction.md) produce iron hydroxides in equilibra}@}:

> - {@{Fe<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) + 2H<sup>+</sup>(aq)}@}
> - {@{Fe<sup>3+</sup>(aq) + 3H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>(s) + 3H<sup>+</sup>(aq)}@}

After forming iron hydroxides, {@{[dehydration](dehydration%20reaction.md) occurs in equilibra}@}:

> - {@{Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) ⇌ FeO(s) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)}@}
> - {@{Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>(s) ⇌ FeO(OH)(s) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)}@}
> - {@{2FeO(OH)(s) ⇌ Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(s) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)}@}

{@{[Ferroxyl indicator solution](ferroxyl%20indicator%20solution.md)}@} can be used to detect rusting. {@{Place the iron and indicator in a warm gel containing [sodium chloride](sodium%20chloride.md)}@} to speed up the reaction.

### rust-resistant alloys

- see: [stainless steel](stainless%20steel.md), [weathering steel](weathering%20steel.md)

Stainless steel {@{forms a [passivation](passivation%20(chemistry).md) layer of [chromium(III) oxide](chromium(III)%20oxide.md)}@}. It is {@{[shiny](gloss%20(optics)) but expensive}@}. It can be used {@{in [cookware](cookware.md) and [cutlery](cutlery.md)}@}.

### coating and painting

Coating and painting {@{isolate iron from the environment}@}.

[Paint](paint.md) can be used for {@{small structures and vehicle bodies}@}. It is {@{cheap but easy to scratch off}@}. [Plastic](plastic.md) can be used for {@{small objects}@}. It is {@{good-looking and long-lasting but relatively more expensive}@}. [Oil](oil.md) or [grease](grease.md) can be used for {@{machines and tools}@}. They are {@{sticky and can lubricate the moving parts}@}.

### electroplating

- see: [electroplating](electroplating.md)

Electroplating {@{isolate iron from the environment. The plating material may also provide [cathodic protection](#cathodic%20protection)}@}.

In [galvanization](galvanization.md), {@{[zinc](zinc.md) is used to make galvanized iron}@}. The material can {@{isolate and act as an [sacrificial anode](galvanic%20anode.md). However, it is [toxic](toxicity.md)}@}. It can be used {@{in [buckets](buckets.md) and [constructions](construction.md)}@}. In [tin-plating](tinning.md), {@{[tin](tin.md) is used for its non-toxicity. However, it accelerates rusting if iron is exposed}@}. It can be used {@{in [tin cans](tin%20can.md)}@}. [Chromium](chromium.md) can also be used for {@{its [shininess](gloss%20(optics).md) but it is expensive}@}. It can be used {@{in [car bumpers](car%20bumper.md) and [water taps](water%20tap.md)}@}.

### cathodic protection

- see: [cathodic protection](cathodic%20protection.md)

Cathodic protection can be achieved via {@{using [galvanic anode](galvanic%20anode.md), impressed current cathodic protection, or a mix of both}@}.

In the former, {@{a more reactive [metal](metal.md) is attached to the iron}@}. The metal requires {@{replacement from time to time}@}. Examples include {@{[galvanized iron](galvanization.md), attaching [zinc](zinc.md) blocks to the ship hull, connecting [magnesium](magnesium.md) to underground pipelines, etc.}@} In the latter, {@{an [electric current](electric%20current.md) is applied with iron as the [cathode](cathode.md)}@}. It is {@{convenient but applicable to few situations}@}. It can be used {@{car bodies, pipelines, and storages}@}.
