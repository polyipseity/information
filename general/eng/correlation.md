# correlation

- This article is about {@{correlation and dependence in statistical data}@}. For other uses, see [correlation (disambiguation)](correlation%20(disambiguation).md). <!--SR:!2025-07-21,226,330-->

In [statistics](statistics.md), __correlation__ or __dependence__ is {@{any statistical relationship, whether [causal](causality.md) or not, between two [random variables](random%20variable.md) or [bivariate data](bivariate%20data.md)}@}. Although in the broadest sense, "correlation" may {@{indicate any type of association}@}, in statistics it {@{usually refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are _[linearly](line%20(geometry).md)_ related}@}. Familiar examples of dependent phenomena include {@{the correlation between the [height](human%20height.md) of parents and their offspring}@}, and {@{the correlation between the price of a good and the quantity the consumers are willing to purchase}@}, as {@{it is depicted in the so-called [demand curve](demand%20curve.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-17,105,290!2025-09-07,264,330!2025-07-20,225,330!2025-06-04,190,310!2025-05-13,172,310!2025-07-27,232,330-->

Correlations are {@{useful}@} because {@{they can indicate a predictive relationship that can be exploited in practice}@}. For example, an electrical utility may {@{produce less power on a mild day based on the correlation between electricity demand and weather}@}. In this example, there is {@{a [causal relationship](causality.md)}@}, because {@{[extreme weather](extreme%20weather.md) causes people to use more electricity for heating or cooling}@}. However, in general, the presence of a correlation is {@{not sufficient to infer the presence of a causal relationship (i.e., [correlation does not imply causation](correlation%20does%20not%20imply%20causation.md))}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-22,180,310!2025-07-26,231,330!2025-07-14,219,310!2025-04-30,162,310!2025-07-23,228,330!2025-03-30,139,310-->

Formally, random variables are {@{_dependent_}@} if {@{they do not satisfy a mathematical property of [probabilistic independence](independence%20(probability%20theory).md)}@}. In {@{informal parlance}@}, _correlation_ is {@{synonymous with _dependence_}@}. However, when {@{used in a technical sense}@}, correlation refers to {@{any of several specific types of mathematical relationship between [the conditional expectation of one variable given the other is not constant as the conditioning variable changes](conditional%20expectation.md)}@}; broadly correlation in this specific sense is used when {@{$E(Y|X=x)$ is related to $x$ in some manner}@} (such as {@{linearly, monotonically, or perhaps according to some particular functional form such as logarithmic}@}). Essentially, correlation is {@{the measure of how two or more variables are related to one another}@}. There are {@{several [correlation coefficients](correlation%20coefficient.md)}@}, often denoted {@{$\rho$ or $r$}@}, measuring {@{the degree of correlation}@}. The most common of these is {@{the _[Pearson correlation coefficient](Pearson%20correlation%20coefficient.md)_}@}, which is {@{sensitive only to a linear relationship between two variables (which may be present even when one variable is a nonlinear function of the other)}@}. Other correlation coefficients – such as {@{_[Spearman's rank correlation](Spearman's%20rank%20correlation%20coefficient.md)_}@} – have been developed to be {@{more [robust](robust%20statistics.md) than Pearson's, that is, more sensitive to nonlinear relationships}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> {@{[Mutual information](mutual%20information.md)}@} can {@{also be applied to measure dependence between two variables}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-11,291,330!2025-03-07,119,290!2025-05-23,167,310!2025-07-24,229,330!2025-07-22,227,330!2025-08-15,247,330!2025-06-07,157,250!2025-02-06,96,290!2025-04-07,145,310!2025-05-20,164,310!2025-06-13,197,310!2025-05-10,154,290!2025-05-19,163,310!2025-02-10,99,290!2025-04-04,141,310!2025-08-16,248,330!2025-07-09,213,310!2025-10-27,270,290-->
