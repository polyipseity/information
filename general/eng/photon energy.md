# photon energy

## formula

### physics

A [photon](photon.md) carries {@{[energy](energy.md) $E$ proportional to its [frequency](frequency.md) $f$}@}: {@{$$E = h f$$}@}, where {@{$E$ is [energy](energy.md) (typically in [joules](joule.md)), $f$ is [frequency](frequency.md) (typically in [hertz](hertz.md)), and $h$ is the [Planck constant](Planck%20constant.md)}@}.

Additionally, using {@{equation _f = c/λ_}@}, {@{$$E = \frac {hc} \lambda$$}@}, where {@{$E$ is [energy](energy.md), $\lambda$ is [wavelength](wavelength.md), $c$ is the [speed of light in vacuum](speed%20of%20light.md), and $h$ is the [Planck constant](Planck%20constant.md)}@}.
