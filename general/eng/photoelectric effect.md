# photoelectric effect

The __photoelectric effect__ is {@{the ejection of [electrons](electron.md) from a material when [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) strikes it}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-05,951,250-->

## observation

A {@{[photocell](photocell.md)}@} can be used to observe the effect. It consists of {@{a [photocathode](photocathode.md), curving around an [anode](anode.md) inside an [evacuated](vacuum.md) glass tube}@}. When the photocathode is shone by light, {@{emitted electrons escape to the anode}@}, {@{producing an [electric current](electric%20current.md)}@}. The current is called {@{photoelectric current, a kind of [photocurrent](photocurrent.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-07-02,1518,310!2027-11-26,934,230!2026-09-26,975,290!2026-03-25,786,250!2028-08-08,1542,310-->

If the light frequency is lower than the {@{threshold frequency}@}, {@{no photoemission occurs}@}. Otherwise, {@{immediate photoemission occurs}@}. {@{Light [intensity](intensity.md) or duration of exposure}@} does not affect photoemission of a single electron. {@{Light intensity}@} only affects the photoelectric current. <!--SR:!2027-05-27,1273,350!2030-06-16,2093,330!2029-06-12,1740,310!2033-01-22,2613,290!2027-08-30,1285,310-->

Emitted electrons have {@{different}@} initial kinetic energies. The maximum kinetic energy of an electron {@{increases with light frequency}@} given that the threshold frequency is exceeded. <!--SR:!2037-01-31,4011,350!2027-03-01,1077,290-->

## mechanism

The classical [wave model](electromagnetic%20radiation.md#wave%20model) predicts that when {@{continuous radiation passes through an electron}@}, {@{the electron gains [kinetic energy](kinentic%20energy.md)}@}, {@{vibrating with increasing amplitude}@}. After {@{some time}@}, when enough energy is accumulated, {@{the electron is emitted}@}. The energy gain increases when {@{light intensity increases}@}. However, {@{[observations](#observation) disagree}@}. <!--SR:!2029-03-30,1501,270!2028-11-20,1575,290!2026-04-04,917,330!2028-09-27,1579,310!2030-07-28,1926,290!2027-07-25,1145,290!2026-08-05,953,290-->

The {@{threshold frequency $\nu_o$}@} is determined by {@{the [work function](work%20function.md) $\Phi$ of the surface of the material}@}:
{@{$$\begin{aligned}\Phi&=h\nu_o\\\nu_o&=\frac\Phi{h}\end{aligned}$$}@}
where {@{$h$ is the [Planck constant](Planck%20constant.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2033-05-15,2796,302!2026-10-13,918,282!2034-11-13,3375,350!2027-01-23,1168,342-->

The {@{maximum kinetic energy $K_\mathrm{max}$}@} is determined by {@{the frequency $f$ of the incoming photon and the work function $\Phi$ of the surface of the material}@}:
{@{$$K_\mathrm{max}=hf-\Phi=hf-hV_o=h\left(f-V_o\right)$$}@}
where {@{$h$ is the Planck constant}@}. <!--SR:!2037-06-20,4161,361!2027-02-28,1112,301!2032-01-22,2356,321!2035-07-28,3555,361-->

Given the threshold frequency is reached, increasing intensity only {@{increases the number of [photons](photon.md) hitting the surface}@}, {@{increasing photoemission}@}, {@{hence photoelectric current}@}. <!--SR:!2029-01-28,1541,262!2028-04-30,1458,310!2033-09-27,2989,330-->
