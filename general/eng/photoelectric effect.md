# photoelectric effect

The __photoelectric effect__ is {@{the ejection of [electrons](electron.md) from a material when [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) strikes it}@}.

## observation

A {@{[photocell](photocell.md)}@} can be used to observe the effect. It consists of {@{a [photocathode](photocathode.md), curving around an [anode](anode.md) inside an [evacuated](vacuum.md) glass tube}@}. When the photocathode is shone by light, {@{emitted electrons escape to the anode}@}, {@{producing an [electric current](electric%20current.md)}@}. The current is called {@{photoelectric current, a kind of [photocurrent](photocurrent.md)}@}.

If the light frequency is lower than the {@{threshold frequency}@}, {@{no photoemission occurs}@}. Otherwise, {@{immediate photoemission occurs}@}. {@{Light [intensity](intensity.md) or duration of exposure}@} does not affect photoemission of a single electron. {@{Light intensity}@} only affects the photoelectric current.

Emitted electrons have {@{different}@} initial kinetic energies. The maximum kinetic energy of an electron {@{increases with light frequency}@} given that the threshold frequency is exceeded.

## mechanism

The classical [wave model](electromagnetic%20radiation.md#wave%20model) predicts that when {@{continuous radiation passes through an electron}@}, {@{the electron gains [kinetic energy](kinentic%20energy.md)}@}, {@{vibrating with increasing amplitude}@}. After {@{some time}@}, when enough energy is accumulated, {@{the electron is emitted}@}. The energy gain increases when {@{light intensity increases}@}. However, {@{[observations](#observation) disagree}@}.

The {@{threshold frequency $\nu_o$}@} is determined by {@{the [work function](work%20function.md) $\Phi$ of the surface of the material}@}:
{@{$$\begin{aligned}\Phi&=h\nu_o\\\nu_o&=\frac\Phi{h}\end{aligned}$$}@}
where {@{$h$ is the [Planck constant](Planck%20constant.md)}@}.

The {@{maximum kinetic energy $K_\mathrm{max}$}@} is determined by {@{the frequency $f$ of the incoming photon and the work function $\Phi$ of the surface of the material}@}:
{@{$$K_\mathrm{max}=hf-\Phi=hf-hV_o=h\left(f-V_o\right)$$}@}
where {@{$h$ is the Planck constant}@}.

Given the threshold frequency is reached, increasing intensity only {@{increases the number of [photons](photon.md) hitting the surface}@}, {@{increasing photoemission}@}, {@{hence photoelectric current}@}.
