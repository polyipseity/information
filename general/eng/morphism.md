# morphism

In {@{[mathematics](mathematics.md)}@}, a __morphism__ is {@{a concept of [category theory](category%20theory.md) that generalizes structure-preserving [maps](map%20(mathematics).md)}@} such as {@{[homomorphism](homomorphism.md) between [algebraic structures](algebraic%20structure.md), [functions](function%20(mathematics).md) from a set to another set, and [continuous functions](continuous%20function.md) between [topological spaces](topological%20space.md)}@}. Although {@{many examples of morphisms are structure-preserving maps, morphisms need not to be maps}@}, but {@{they can be composed in a way that is similar to [function composition](function%20composition.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-27,275,330!2025-12-15,263,330!2025-10-21,203,310!2026-01-20,294,330!2025-12-18,266,330-->

{@{Morphisms and [objects](mathematical%20object.md)}@} are {@{constituents of a [category](category%20(mathematics).md)}@}. {@{Morphisms, also called _maps_ or _arrows_}@}, {@{relate two objects called the _source_ and the _target_ of the morphism}@}. There is {@{a [partial operation](binary%20operation.md#terminology), called _composition_}@}, on {@{the morphisms of a category that is defined if the target of the first object equals the source of the second object}@}. The composition of morphisms {@{behave like function composition}@} \({@{[associativity](associative%20property.md) of composition when it is defined, and existence of an [identity morphism](morphism.md#identity) for every object}@}\). <!--SR:!2026-01-14,288,330!2025-12-20,268,330!2025-12-29,276,330!2026-01-12,286,330!2026-01-07,283,330!2026-01-01,278,330!2026-01-09,285,330!2026-10-15,484,310-->

Morphisms and categories {@{recur in much of contemporary mathematics}@}. Originally, they were {@{introduced for [homological algebra](homological%20algebra.md) and [algebraic topology](algebraic%20topology.md)}@}. They belong to {@{the foundational tools of [Grothendieck](Alexander%20Grothendieck.md)'s [scheme theory](scheme%20(mathematics).md)}@}, a generalization of {@{[algebraic geometry](algebraic%20geometry.md) that applies also to [algebraic number theory](algebraic%20number%20theory.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-20,294,330!2025-12-31,277,330!2027-08-07,717,330!2026-01-19,293,330-->

## definition

A [category](category%20(mathematics).md) _C_ consists of {@{two [classes](class%20(set%20theory).md), one of objects and the other of morphisms}@}. There are {@{two objects that are associated to every morphism, the source and the target}@}. {@{A _morphism_ _f_ _from_ _X_ _to_ _Y_}@} is {@{a morphism with source _X_ and target _Y_}@}; it is commonly written as {@{_f_ : _X_ → _Y_ or $X \overset f \to Y$}@} the latter form {@{being better suited for [commutative diagrams](commutative%20diagram.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-09,285,330!2027-06-13,678,330!2026-01-04,281,330!2025-12-29,276,330!2025-12-26,274,330!2026-01-15,289,330-->

For {@{many common categories}@}, objects are {@{[sets](set%20(mathematics).md) \(often with some additional structure\) and morphisms are [functions](function%20(mathematics).md) from an object to another object}@}. Therefore, the source and the target of a morphism are often called {@{domain and codomain respectively}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-04,281,330!2025-12-01,255,330!2026-01-14,288,330-->

Morphisms are {@{equipped with a [partial binary operation](binary%20operation.md#terminology), called composition}@}. {@{The composition of two morphisms _f_ and _g_}@} is {@{defined precisely when the target of _f_ is the source of _g_, and is denoted _g_ ∘ _f_ \(or sometimes simply _gf_\)}@}. The source of _g_ ∘ _f_ is {@{the source of _f_, and the target of _g_ ∘ _f_ is the target of _g_}@}. The composition {@{satisfies two [axioms](axiom.md): (annotation: they are identity, associativity)}@} <!--SR:!2026-01-20,294,330!2025-12-23,271,330!2025-12-01,255,330!2025-12-21,269,330!2026-01-04,281,330-->

__Identity__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; For every object _X_, there exists a morphism id<sub>_X_</sub> : _X_ → _X_ called the __identity morphism__ on _X_, such that for every morphism _f_ : _A_ → _B_ we have id<sub>_B_</sub> ∘ _f_ = _f_ = _f_ ∘ id<sub>_A_</sub>. <!--SR:!2025-12-01,255,330!2025-12-01,255,330-->

__[Associativity](associative%20property.md)__ <p> ::@:: &emsp; _h_ ∘ \(_g_ ∘ _f_\) = \(_h_ ∘ _g_\) ∘ _f_ whenever all the compositions are defined, i.e. when the target of _f_ is the source of _g_, and the target of _g_ is the source of _h_. <!--SR:!2026-01-19,293,330!2025-12-01,255,330-->

For {@{a concrete category \(a category in which the objects are sets, possibly with additional structure, and the morphisms are structure-preserving functions\)}@}, the identity morphism is {@{just the [identity function](identity%20function.md)}@}, and composition is {@{just ordinary [composition of functions](function%20composition.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-01,278,330!2025-12-22,270,330!2025-12-25,273,330-->

The composition of morphisms is often represented by {@{a [commutative diagram](commutative%20diagram.md). For example, ![commutative diagram for composition of morphisms](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Commutative%20diagram%20for%20morphism.svg)}@} <!--SR:!2026-01-20,294,330-->

{@{The collection of all morphisms from _X_ to _Y_}@} is denoted {@{Hom<sub>_C_</sub>\(_X_, _Y_\) or simply Hom\(_X_, _Y_\)}@} and called {@{the __hom-set__ between _X_ and _Y_}@}. Some authors write {@{Mor<sub>_C_</sub>\(_X_, _Y_\), Mor\(_X_, _Y_\) or C\(_X_, _Y_\)}@}. The term hom-set is {@{something of a misnomer, as the collection of morphisms is not required to be a set}@}; {@{a category where Hom\(_X_, _Y_\) is a set for all objects _X_ and _Y_}@} is called {@{[locally small](category%20(mathematics).md#small%20and%20large%20categories)}@}. Because {@{hom-sets may not be sets}@}, some people {@{prefer to use the term "hom-class"}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-02,279,330!2026-01-13,287,330!2026-01-16,290,330!2026-01-16,290,330!2026-01-19,293,330!2026-01-16,290,330!2025-12-19,267,330!2026-01-09,285,330!2026-01-19,293,330-->

{@{The domain and codomain}@} are in fact {@{part of the information determining a morphism}@}. For example, in {@{the [category of sets](category%20of%20sets.md), where morphisms are functions}@}, two functions may be {@{identical as sets of ordered pairs \(may have the same [range](range%20of%20a%20function.md)\), while having different codomains}@}. The two functions are {@{distinct from the viewpoint of category theory}@}. Thus many authors {@{require that the hom-classes Hom\(_X_, _Y_\) be [disjoint](disjoint%20sets.md)}@}. In practice, {@{this is not a problem}@} because {@{if this disjointness does not hold, it can be assured by appending the domain and codomain to the morphisms}@} \(say, {@{as the second and third components of an ordered triple}@}\). <!--SR:!2026-01-14,288,330!2026-01-19,293,330!2026-01-03,280,330!2027-05-30,611,310!2025-12-29,276,330!2026-01-09,285,330!2025-12-20,268,330!2025-12-29,276,330!2026-01-19,293,330-->

## some special morphisms

### monomorphisms and epimorphisms

{@{A morphism _f_ : _X_ → _Y_ is called a [monomorphism](monomorphism.md)}@} if {@{_f_ ∘ _g_<sub>1</sub> = _f_ ∘ _g_<sub>2</sub> implies _g_<sub>1</sub> = _g_<sub>2</sub> for all morphisms _g_<sub>1</sub>, _g_<sub>2</sub> : _Z_ → _X_}@}. A monomorphism can be called {@{a _mono_ for short, and we can use _monic_ as an adjective}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> A morphism _f_ has {@{a __left inverse__ or is a __split monomorphism__}@} if {@{there is a morphism _g_ : _Y_ → _X_ such that _g_ ∘ _f_ = id<sub>_X_</sub>}@}. Thus {@{_f_ ∘ _g_ : _Y_ → _Y_ is [idempotent](idempotence.md)}@}; that is, {@{\(_f_ ∘ _g_\)<sup>2</sup> = _f_ ∘ \(_g_ ∘ _f_\) ∘ _g_ = _f_ ∘ _g_}@}. The left inverse _g_ is also called {@{a __[retraction](section%20(category%20theory).md)__ of _f_}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-17,291,330!2026-01-03,280,330!2026-01-01,278,330!2027-01-07,514,310!2025-12-29,276,330!2026-01-15,289,330!2025-12-24,272,330!2025-12-19,267,330-->

{@{Morphisms with left inverses are always monomorphisms}@}, but {@{the [converse](converse%20(logic).md) is not true in general; a monomorphism may fail to have a left inverse}@}. In {@{[concrete categories](concrete%20category.md)}@}, {@{a function that has a left inverse is [injective](injective%20function.md)}@}. Thus {@{in concrete categories, monomorphisms are often, but not always, injective}@}. {@{The condition of being an injection}@} is {@{stronger than that of being a monomorphism, but weaker than that of being a split monomorphism}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-29,276,330!2025-12-28,275,330!2026-06-16,394,310!2028-02-11,851,330!2026-01-09,285,330!2026-01-13,287,330!2028-01-31,844,330-->

Dually to {@{monomorphisms}@}, {@{a morphism _f_ : _X_ → _Y_ is called an [epimorphism](epimorphism.md)}@} if {@{_g_<sub>1</sub> ∘ _f_ = _g_<sub>2</sub> ∘ _f_ implies _g_<sub>1</sub> = _g_<sub>2</sub> for all morphisms _g_<sub>1</sub>, _g_<sub>2</sub> : _Y_ → _Z_}@}. An epimorphism can be called {@{an _epi_ for short, and we can use _epic_ as an adjective}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> A morphism _f_ has {@{a __right inverse__ or is a __split epimorphism__}@} if {@{there is a morphism _g_ : _Y_ → _X_ such that _f_ ∘ _g_ = id<sub>_Y_</sub>}@}. The right inverse _g_ is also called {@{a __section__ of _f_}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {@{Morphisms having a right inverse are always epimorphisms}@}, but {@{the converse is not true in general, as an epimorphism may fail to have a right inverse}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-16,264,330!2026-01-20,294,330!2027-12-22,812,330!2028-01-23,837,330!2025-12-29,276,330!2025-12-29,276,330!2027-05-27,664,330!2025-12-17,265,330!2025-10-14,198,310-->

If {@{a monomorphism _f_ splits with left inverse _g_}@}, then {@{_g_ is a split epimorphism with right inverse _f_}@}. In {@{[concrete categories](concrete%20category.md), a function that has a right inverse is [surjective](surjective%20function.md)}@}. Thus {@{in concrete categories, epimorphisms are often, but not always, surjective}@}. {@{The condition of being a surjection}@} is {@{stronger than that of being an epimorphism, but weaker than that of being a split epimorphism}@}. In {@{the [category of sets](category%20of%20sets.md)}@}, the statement that {@{every surjection has a section is equivalent to the [axiom of choice](axiom%20of%20choice.md)}@}. \(annotation: {@{The section is constructed by}@}: For {@{every element _y_ of the codomain}@}, choose {@{an <!-- previously unchosen (unnecessary since the surjection is a function) --> element _x_ in the domain that maps to _y_}@}, and define {@{the section to map _y_ to _x_}@}, and the resulting section is {@{invertible by the surjection}@}. {@{Choosing an element in the domain that maps to _y_ in general}@} {@{requires the axiom of choice}@}.\) <!--SR:!2025-12-01,255,330!2025-12-25,272,330!2026-01-08,284,330!2025-12-29,276,330!2027-01-01,509,310!2026-01-15,289,330!2025-12-01,255,330!2026-03-31,319,290!2026-01-02,100,290!2025-10-26,20,366!2025-10-26,20,366!2025-10-25,19,366!2025-10-25,19,366!2025-10-26,20,366!2025-10-24,18,366-->

{@{A morphism that is both an epimorphism and a monomorphism}@} is called {@{a __bimorphism__}@}. <!--SR:!2027-07-17,704,330!2026-01-08,284,330-->

### isomorphisms

{@{A morphism _f_ : _X_ → _Y_ is called an [isomorphism](isomorphism.md)}@} if {@{there exists a morphism _g_ : _Y_ → _X_ such that _f_ ∘ _g_ = id<sub>_Y_</sub> and _g_ ∘ _f_ = id<sub>_X_</sub>}@}. If {@{a morphism has both left-inverse and right-inverse}@}, then {@{the two inverses are equal}@}, so {@{_f_ is an isomorphism, and _g_ is called simply the __inverse__ of _f_}@}. Inverse morphisms, {@{if they exist, are unique}@}. The inverse _g_ is {@{also an isomorphism, with inverse _f_}@}. {@{Two objects with an isomorphism between them}@} are said to be {@{[isomorphic](isomorphism.md) or equivalent}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-18,292,330!2025-12-29,276,330!2026-01-09,285,330!2025-12-29,276,330!2026-01-17,291,330!2026-01-12,286,330!2026-01-06,282,330!2026-01-02,279,330!2026-01-06,282,330-->

While {@{every isomorphism is a bimorphism, a bimorphism is not necessarily an isomorphism}@}. For example, in {@{the category of [commutative rings](commutative%20ring.md)}@} {@{the inclusion __Z__ → __Q__ is a bimorphism that is not an isomorphism}@}. (annotation: {@{The ring homomorphism _f_: __Z__ → __Q__}@} is required to respect {@{_f_(_a_ + _b_) = _f_(_a_) + _f_(_b_), _f_(_ab_) = _f_(_a_)_f_(_b_) and _f_(_1_) = _1_}@}. Clearly, {@{the identity map _f_(_a_) := _a_ is a ring homomorphism for __Z__ → __Q__ and there is no inverse, thus not an isomorphism}@}.) However, {@{any morphism that is both an epimorphism and a _split_ monomorphism}@}, or {@{both a monomorphism and a _split_ epimorphism}@}, {@{must be an isomorphism}@}. {@{A category, such as a __Set__, in which every bimorphism is an isomorphism}@} is known as {@{a __[balanced category](balanced%20category.md)__}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-07,283,330!2026-01-06,282,330!2025-12-31,277,330!2025-12-26,273,330!2028-01-19,846,330!2027-05-11,586,310!2027-06-07,608,310!2025-12-28,276,330!2026-01-16,290,330!2026-01-09,285,330!2025-11-04,25,369-->

### endomorphisms and automorphisms

{@{A morphism _f_ : _X_ → _X_ \(that is, a morphism with identical source and target\)}@} is {@{an [endomorphism](endomorphism.md) of _X_}@}. {@{A __split endomorphism__}@} is {@{an idempotent endomorphism _f_ <!-- if _f_ -->that additionally admits a decomposition _f_ = _h_ ∘ _g_ with _g_ ∘ _h_ = id}@}. In particular, {@{the [Karoubi envelope](Karoubi%20envelope.md) of a category}@} {@{splits every idempotent morphism (annotation: note that an idempotent morphism must be an endomorphism, or otherwise you cannot compose it with itself)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-25,273,330!2026-01-18,292,330!2026-11-09,495,310!2025-12-27,274,330!2026-10-18,484,310!2026-05-23,308,250-->

{@{An [automorphism](automorphism.md)}@} is {@{a morphism that is both an endomorphism and an isomorphism}@}. In {@{every category, the automorphisms of an object always form a [group](group%20(mathematics).md)}@}, called {@{the [automorphism group](automorphism%20group.md) of the object}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-16,290,330!2026-01-15,289,330!2026-01-04,281,330!2026-01-04,281,330-->

## examples

- For [algebraic structures](algebraic%20structure.md) commonly considered in [algebra](algebra.md), such as [groups](group%20(mathematics).md), [rings](ring%20(mathematics).md), [modules](module%20(mathematics).md), etc., the morphisms are usually the [homomorphisms](homomorphism.md), and the notions of isomorphism, automorphism, endomorphism, epimorphism, and monomorphism are the same as the above defined ones. However, in the case of rings, "epimorphism" is often considered as a synonym of "[surjection](surjective%20function.md)", although there are [ring epimorphisms](ring%20homomorphism.md) that are not surjective \(e.g., when embedding the [integers](integer.md) in the [rational numbers](rational%20number.md)\).
- In the [category of topological spaces](category%20of%20topological%20spaces.md), the morphisms are the [continuous functions](continuous%20function.md) and isomorphisms are called [homeomorphisms](homeomorphism.md). There are [bijections](bijection.md) \(that is, isomorphisms of sets\) that are not homeomorphisms.
- In the category of [smooth manifolds](differentiable%20manifold.md#definition), the morphisms are the [smooth functions](smoothness.md) and isomorphisms are called [diffeomorphisms](diffeomorphism.md).
- In the category of [small categories](category%20(mathematics).md#small%20and%20large%20categories), the morphisms are [functors](functor.md).
- In a [functor category](functor%20category.md), the morphisms are [natural transformations](natural%20transformation.md).
