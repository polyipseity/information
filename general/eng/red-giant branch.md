# red-giant branch

## evolution

### ascending the red-giant branch

Stars at {@{the foot of the red-giant branch}@} all have {@{a similar temperature around 5&nbsp;000 [K](Kelvin.md), corresponding to an early to mid-K spectral type}@}. Their luminosities {@{range from a few times the luminosity of the sun for the least massive red giants to several thousand times as luminous for stars around 8 M<sub>☉</sub>}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-25,738,330!2025-12-23,345,290!2027-01-19,582,250-->

As {@{their hydrogen shells continue to produce more helium}@}, the cores of RGB stars {@{increase in mass and temperature}@}. This causes {@{the hydrogen shell to fuse more rapidly}@}. Stars become {@{more luminous, larger and somewhat cooler on the surface. They are described as ascending the RGB}@}. <!--SR:!2026-10-29,622,330!2027-07-21,824,330!2025-10-10,309,290!2026-10-25,570,310-->

On {@{the ascent of the RGB}@}, there are {@{a number of internal events that produce observable external features}@}. {@{The outer [convective envelope](convection%20zone.md)}@} becomes {@{deeper and deeper as the star grows and shell energy production increases}@}. Eventually it {@{reaches deep enough to bring fusion products to the surface from the formerly convective core}@}, known as {@{the first [dredge-up](dredge-up.md)}@}. This changes {@{the surface abundance of helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen}@}. {@{A noticeable clustering of stars at one point on the RGB}@} can be detected and is known as {@{the RGB bump}@}. It is caused by {@{a discontinuity in hydrogen abundance left behind by the deep convection}@}. {@{Shell energy production}@} {@{temporarily decreases at this discontinuity}@}, effectively {@{stalling the ascent of the RGB and causing an excess of stars at that point}@}. <!--SR:!2026-10-21,618,330!2027-05-06,713,290!2027-08-04,743,290!2025-11-28,345,290!2026-01-03,388,310!2028-10-28,1205,350!2027-02-12,653,290!2028-03-04,927,290!2025-12-06,75,347!2025-12-16,84,347!2025-12-03,73,347!2025-12-04,74,347!2025-12-07,76,347-->

### leaving the red-giant branch

A degenerate core {@{begins fusion explosively in an event known as the [helium flash](helium%20flash.md)}@}, but {@{externally there is little immediate sign of it}@}. The energy is {@{consumed in lifting the degeneracy in the core}@}. The star overall {@{becomes less luminous and hotter and migrates to the horizontal branch}@}. All degenerate helium cores {@{have approximately the same mass, regardless of the total stellar mass}@}, so {@{the helium fusion luminosity on the horizontal branch is the same}@}. Hydrogen shell fusion can {@{cause the total stellar luminosity to vary}@}, but for {@{most stars at near solar metallicity, the temperature and luminosity are very similar at the cool end of the horizontal branch}@}. These stars form {@{the [red clump](red%20clump.md) at about 5&nbsp;000 K and 50 L<sub>☉</sub>}@}. Less massive hydrogen envelopes cause {@{the stars to take up a hotter and less luminous position on the horizontal branch}@}, and this effect occurs {@{more readily at low metallicity so that old metal-poor clusters show the most pronounced horizontal branches}@}. <!--SR:!2029-08-01,1425,350!2028-12-26,1254,350!2027-02-19,699,330!2027-04-10,665,290!2026-01-28,406,310!2026-06-14,435,270!2028-01-19,941,310!2026-06-08,447,250!2025-10-30,277,250!2026-05-27,374,210!2025-11-04,255,230-->

Stars {@{initially more massive than 2 M<sub>☉</sub>}@} have {@{non-degenerate helium cores on the red-giant branch}@}. These stars {@{become hot enough to start triple-alpha fusion before they reach the tip of the red-giant branch and before the core becomes degenerate}@}. They then leave the red-giant branch and {@{perform a [blue loop](blue%20loop.md) before returning to join the asymptotic giant branch}@}. Stars only a little more massive than 2 M<sub>☉</sub> {@{perform a barely noticeable blue loop at a few hundred L<sub>☉</sub> before continuing on the AGB hardly distinguishable from their red-giant branch position}@}. More massive stars {@{perform extended blue loops which can reach 10&nbsp;000 K or more at luminosities of thousands of L<sub>☉</sub>}@}. These stars will {@{cross the [instability strip](instability%20strip.md) more than once and pulsate as [Type I (Classical) Cepheid variables](classical%20Cepheid%20variable.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-02,341,310!2026-11-28,611,290!2027-10-10,863,310!2027-08-03,762,270!2026-06-03,381,230!2026-05-30,456,270!2028-05-03,1000,310-->
