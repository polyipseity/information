# red-giant branch

## evolution

### ascending the red-giant branch

Stars at {@{the foot of the red-giant branch}@} all have {@{a similar temperature around 5&nbsp;000 [K](Kelvin.md), corresponding to an early to mid-K spectral type}@}. Their luminosities {@{range from a few times the luminosity of the sun for the least massive red giants to several thousand times as luminous for stars around 8 M<sub>☉</sub>}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-17,172,310!2025-12-23,345,290!2025-06-16,179,230-->

As {@{their hydrogen shells continue to produce more helium}@}, the cores of RGB stars {@{increase in mass and temperature}@}. This causes {@{the hydrogen shell to fuse more rapidly}@}. Stars become {@{more luminous, larger and somewhat cooler on the surface. They are described as ascending the RGB}@}. <!--SR:!2026-10-29,622,330!2025-04-18,192,310!2025-10-10,309,290!2025-04-03,184,310-->

On the ascent of the RGB, there are {@{a number of internal events that produce observable external features}@}. The outer [convective envelope](convection%20zone.md) becomes {@{deeper and deeper as the star grows and shell energy production increases}@}. Eventually it {@{reaches deep enough to bring fusion products to the surface from the formerly convective core, known as the first [dredge-up](dredge-up.md)}@}. This changes {@{the surface abundance of helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen}@}. {@{A noticeable clustering of stars at one point on the RGB}@} can be detected and is known as {@{the RGB bump}@}. It is caused by {@{a discontinuity in hydrogen abundance left behind by the deep convection}@}. Shell {@{energy production temporarily decreases at this discontinuity, effective stalling the ascent of the RGB and causing an excess of stars at that point}@}. <!--SR:!2026-10-21,618,330!2025-05-21,188,270!2025-07-22,256,290!2025-11-28,345,290!2026-01-03,388,310!2025-07-09,265,330!2025-04-30,173,270!2025-08-20,246,270-->

### leaving the red-giant branch

A degenerate core {@{begins fusion explosively in an event known as the [helium flash](helium%20flash.md)}@}, but {@{externally there is little immediate sign of it}@}. The energy is {@{consumed in lifting the degeneracy in the core}@}. The star overall {@{becomes less luminous and hotter and migrates to the horizontal branch}@}. All degenerate helium cores {@{have approximately the same mass, regardless of the total stellar mass}@}, so {@{the helium fusion luminosity on the horizontal branch is the same}@}. Hydrogen shell fusion can {@{cause the total stellar luminosity to vary}@}, but for {@{most stars at near solar metallicity, the temperature and luminosity are very similar at the cool end of the horizontal branch}@}. These stars form {@{the [red clump](red%20clump.md) at about 5&nbsp;000 K and 50 L<sub>☉</sub>}@}. Less massive hydrogen envelopes cause {@{the stars to take up a hotter and less luminous position on the horizontal branch}@}, and this effect occurs {@{more readily at low metallicity so that old metal-poor clusters show the most pronounced horizontal branches}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-06,312,330!2025-07-19,274,330!2025-03-22,163,310!2025-06-13,229,290!2026-01-28,406,310!2025-04-05,161,270!2025-06-22,234,290!2025-03-18,136,230!2025-10-30,277,250!2025-05-15,135,190!2025-02-22,111,230-->

Stars {@{initially more massive than 2 M<sub>☉</sub>}@} have {@{non-degenerate helium cores on the red-giant branch}@}. These stars {@{become hot enough to start triple-alpha fusion before they reach the tip of the red-giant branch and before the core becomes degenerate}@}. They then leave the red-giant branch and {@{perform a [blue loop](blue%20loop.md) before returning to join the asymptotic giant branch}@}. Stars only a little more massive than 2 M<sub>☉</sub> {@{perform a barely noticeable blue loop at a few hundred L<sub>☉</sub> before continuing on the AGB hardly distinguishable from their red-giant branch position}@}. More massive stars {@{perform extended blue loops which can reach 10&nbsp;000 K or more at luminosities of thousands of L<sub>☉</sub>}@}. These stars will {@{cross the [instability strip](instability%20strip.md) more than once and pulsate as [Type I (Classical) Cepheid variables](classical%20Cepheid%20variable.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-02,341,310!2025-03-27,161,270!2025-05-27,214,290!2025-07-02,217,250!2025-05-16,163,230!2025-02-28,129,250!2025-08-07,249,290-->
