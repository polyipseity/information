# _k_-nearest neighbors algorithm

## algorithm

The training samples are {@{[feature vectors](feature%20(machine%20learning).md#feature%20vectors) representing in a multidimensional space, each with a class label}@}. The training phase {@{consists only of storing the vectors and class labels}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-12,146,290!2026-01-28,403,270-->

In the classification phase, {@{_k_ is a user-defined [hyperparameter](hyperparameter%20(machine%20learning).md)}@}. An unlabeled sample, represented as {@{a feature vector, is classified by assigning the label to which is the most frequent among the _k_ nearest training samples}@}. <!--SR:!2026-09-24,634,330!2025-05-12,240,290-->
