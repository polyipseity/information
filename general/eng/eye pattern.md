> {@{Graphical eye pattern}@} showing an example of {@{two power levels in an [OOK](on-off%20keying.md) modulation scheme}@}. {@{Constant binary 1 and 0 levels}@} are shown, as well as {@{transitions from 0 to 1, 1 to 0, 0 to 1 to 0, and 1 to 0 to 1}@}.

In {@{[telecommunications](telecommunications.md)}@}, {@{an __eye pattern__, also known as an __eye diagram__}@}, is {@{an [oscilloscope](oscilloscope.md) display}@} in which {@{a [digital signal](digital%20signal.md) from a receiver is repetitively sampled and applied to the vertical input \(_y-axis_\)}@}, while {@{the data rate is used to trigger the horizontal sweep \(_x-axis_\)}@}. It is so called because, for {@{several types of coding}@}, the pattern looks like {@{a series of eyes between a pair of rails}@}. It is {@{a tool for the evaluation}@} of {@{the combined effects of channel noise, dispersion and [intersymbol interference](intersymbol%20interference.md)}@} on {@{the performance of a baseband pulse-transmission system}@}. The technique was first used with {@{the [WWII](WWII.md) [SIGSALY](SIGSALY.md) secure speech transmission system}@}.

From {@{a mathematical perspective}@}, an eye pattern is a visualization of {@{the [probability density function](probability%20density%20function.md) \(PDF\) of the signal}@}, {@{[modulo](modular%20arithmetic.md) the [unit interval](unit%20interval%20(data%20transmission).md) \(UI\)}@}. In other words, it shows the probability of {@{the signal being at each possible voltage across the duration of the UI}@}. Typically {@{a [color ramp](false%20color.md#pseudocolor) is applied to the PDF}@} in order to {@{make small brightness differences easier to visualize}@}.

{@{Several [system](system.md) performance measurements}@} can be derived by {@{analyzing the display}@}. If the signals are {@{too long, too short, poorly synchronized with the system clock}@}, {@{too high, too low, too [noisy](noise%20(electronics).md)}@}, or {@{too slow to change, or have too much undershoot or [overshoot](overshoot%20(signal).md)}@}, this can be {@{observed from the eye diagram}@}. {@{An open eye pattern}@} corresponds to {@{minimal signal [distortion](distortion.md)}@}. {@{Distortion of the signal [waveform](waveform.md)}@} due to {@{[intersymbol interference](intersymbol%20interference.md) and noise}@} appears as {@{closure of the eye pattern}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup>

## calculation

### source data

{@{The first step of computing an eye pattern}@} is normally to {@{obtain the waveform being analyzed in a quantized form}@}. This may be done by {@{measuring an actual electrical system}@} with {@{an oscilloscope of sufficient bandwidth}@}, or by creating {@{synthetic data with a [circuit simulator](circuit%20simulator.md)}@} in order to {@{evaluate the signal integrity of a proposed design}@}. {@{A combination of the two approaches}@} may be used as well: simulating the effects of {@{an arbitrary circuit or [transmission line](transmission%20line.md) on a measured signal}@}, perhaps to determine {@{whether a signal will still be intelligible after passing through a long cable}@}. {@{[Interpolation](interpolation.md)}@} may also be applied at this time in order to {@{increase the number of samples per unit interval \(UI\)}@} and produce {@{a smooth, gap-free plot}@} which is {@{more visually appealing and easier to understand}@}.

### slicing

Next, {@{the position of each sample within the UI}@} must be {@{determined}@}. There are {@{several methods for doing this}@} depending on {@{the characteristics of the signal and the capabilities of the oscilloscope and software}@} in use. This step is {@{critically important}@} for {@{accurate visualization of [jitter](jitter.md) in the eye}@}.

#### triggering

{@{A very simple method of slicing}@} is to {@{set the oscilloscope display}@} to be {@{slightly more than one UI wide}@}, trigger on {@{both rising and falling edges in the signal}@}, and {@{enable display persistence}@} so that {@{all measured waveforms "stack" into a single plot}@}. This has the advantage of being {@{possible on almost any oscilloscope \(even fully analog ones\)}@} and can provide {@{decent visualization of noise and overall signal shape}@}, but completely {@{destroys the jitter content of the signal}@} since {@{the instrument's trigger re-synchronizes the plot to each UI}@}. {@{The only jitter visible with this method}@} is {@{that of the oscilloscope itself}@}, as well as {@{extremely high frequency jitter}@} \({@{frequencies with period less than the UI}@}\).

#### fixed rate

A simple way to have {@{the eye pattern display jitter in the signal}@} is to estimate {@{the [symbol rate](symbol%20rate.md) of the signal}@} \(perhaps by counting {@{the average number of zero crossings in a known window of time}@}\) and acquiring {@{many UIs in a single oscilloscope capture}@}. {@{The first zero crossing in the capture}@} is {@{located and declared to be the start of the first UI}@}, and {@{the remainder of the waveform}@} is divided {@{into chunks one UI long}@}.

This approach can {@{work adequately}@} for {@{stable signals in which the symbol rate remains exactly the same over time}@}, however {@{inaccuracies in the system}@} mean that {@{some drift is inevitable}@} so it is {@{rarely used in practice}@}. In {@{some protocols, such as [SATA](SATA.md)}@}, {@{the symbol rate is intentionally varied}@} by use of {@{[spread spectrum clocking](spread%20spectrum%20clocking.md#clock%20signal%20generation)}@}, so {@{assuming a fixed rate}@} will lead to the eye {@{grossly exaggerating the actual jitter present on the signal}@}. \(While {@{spread spectrum modulation on a clock}@} is {@{technically jitter in the strict sense}@}, {@{receivers for these systems}@} are designed to {@{track the modulation}@}. {@{The only jitter of interest to a signal integrity engineer}@} is jitter {@{much faster than the modulation rate}@}, which {@{the receiver cannot track effectively}@}.\)

#### reference clock

With {@{some protocols, such as [HDMI](HDMI.md)}@}, {@{a reference clock}@} is supplied {@{along with the signal}@}, either {@{at the symbol rate or at a lower \(but synchronized\) frequency}@} from which {@{a symbol clock can be reconstructed}@}. Since {@{the actual receiver in the system}@} uses {@{the reference clock to sample the data}@}, {@{using this clock to determine UI boundaries}@} allows the eye pattern to {@{faithfully display the signal as the receiver sees it}@}: {@{only jitter between the signal and the reference clock}@} is {@{displayed}@}.

#### clock recovery

{@{Most high speed serial signals}@}, such as {@{[PCIe](PCIe.md), [DisplayPort](DisplayPort.md), and most variants of [Ethernet](ethernet.md)}@}, use {@{a [line code](line%20code.md)}@} which is intended to allow {@{easy [clock recovery](clock%20recovery.md) by means of a [PLL](PLL.md)}@}. Since this is {@{how the actual receiver works}@}, {@{the most accurate way to slice data}@} for the eye pattern is to implement {@{a PLL with the same characteristics in software}@}. {@{Correct PLL configuration}@} allows for the eye to conceal {@{the effects of spread spectrum clocking}@} and other {@{long-term variation in the symbol rate}@} which {@{do not contribute to errors at the receiver}@}, while still {@{displaying higher frequency jitter}@}.

### integration

{@{The samples}@} are then accumulated {@{into a two-dimensional [histogram](histogram.md)}@}, with {@{the X axis representing time within the UI and the Y axis representing voltage}@}. This is {@{then [normalized](feature%20scaling.md)}@} by dividing {@{the value in each histogram bin by the value in the largest bin}@}. {@{[Tone mapping](tone%20mapping.md), logarithmic scaling}@}, or other {@{mathematical transformations}@} may be applied in order to emphasize {@{different portions of the distribution}@}, and {@{a color gradient}@} is applied to {@{the final eye for display}@}.

{@{Large amounts of data}@} may be needed to provide {@{an accurate representation of the signal}@}; {@{tens to hundreds of millions of UIs}@} are frequently {@{used for a single eye pattern}@}. In the example below, {@{the eye using twelve thousand UIs}@} only shows {@{the basic shape of the eye}@}, while {@{the eye using eight million UIs}@} shows {@{far more nuance on the rising and falling edges}@}.

## modulation

Each form of {@{baseband modulation}@} produces {@{an eye pattern with a unique appearance}@}.

### NRZ

The eye pattern of {@{a [NRZ](non-return-to-zero.md) \(annotation: non-return-to-zero\) signal}@} should consist of {@{two clearly distinct levels with smooth transitions between them}@}.

> {@{Eye pattern}@} of {@{a 1.25 Gbit/s NRZ signal}@}

### MLT-3

The eye pattern of {@{a [MLT-3](MLT-3%20encoding.md) \(annotation: multi-level transmit\) signal}@} should consist of {@{three clearly distinct levels \(nominally -1, 0, +1 from bottom to top\)}@}. {@{The 0 level}@} should be located {@{at zero volts}@} and {@{the overall shape}@} should be {@{symmetric about the horizontal axis}@}. {@{The +1 and -1 states}@} should {@{have equal amplitude}@}. There should be {@{smooth transitions from the 0 state to the +1 and -1 states}@}, however there should be {@{no direct transitions from the -1 to +1 state}@} \(which would indicate the signal is {@{PAM-3 rather than MLT-3}@}\).

### PAM

The eye pattern of {@{a [PAM](pulse-amplitude%20modulation.md) \(annotation: pulse-amplitude modulation\) signal}@} should consist of {@{N clearly distinct levels}@} \(depending on {@{the PAM order}@}, for example {@{PAM-4 should have four levels and PAM-3 should have three}@}\). {@{The overall shape}@} should be {@{symmetric about the horizontal axis}@} and {@{the spacing of all levels}@} should be {@{uniform}@}.

## channel effects

{@{Many properties of a [channel](communication%20channel.md)}@} can be seen in {@{the eye pattern}@}.

### emphasis

{@{[Emphasis](emphasis%20(telecommunications).md)}@} applied to a signal produces {@{an additional level for each value of the signal}@} which is {@{higher \(for pre-emphasis\) or lower \(for de-emphasis\) than the nominal value}@}.

{@{The eye pattern for a signal with emphasis}@} may be mistaken for that of {@{a PAM signal}@} at first glance, however {@{closer inspection}@} reveals {@{some key differences}@}. Most notably, {@{an emphasized signal}@} has {@{a limited set of legal transitions}@}:

- Strong state to corresponding weak state ::@:: \(1-1 or 0-0 bit pattern\)
- Strong state to opposite strong state ::@:: \(second transition of a 1-0-1 or 0-1-0 bit pattern\)
- Weak state to opposite strong state ::@:: \(second transition of a 1-1-0 or 0-0-1 bit pattern\)

{@{An emphasized signal}@} will never {@{transition from a weak state to the corresponding strong state}@}, {@{a weak state to another weak state}@}, or {@{remain in the same strong state for more than one UI}@}. {@{A PAM signal}@} also normally {@{has equally spaced levels}@} while {@{emphasized levels}@} are normally {@{closer to the nominal signal level}@}.

>
> {@{Eye pattern}@} of {@{a 1.25 Gbps NRZ signal}@} with {@{6 dB of pre-emphasis}@}

### high-frequency loss

{@{Loss \(annotation: power loss\)}@} of {@{printed circuit board traces and cables}@} {@{increases with frequency due to [dielectric loss](dielectric%20loss.md)}@}, which causes {@{the channel}@} to {@{behave as a [low-pass filter](low-pass%20filter.md)}@}. {@{The effect of this}@} is {@{an increase in signal rise/fall time}@}. If {@{the data rate is high enough or the channel is lossy enough}@}, the signal {@{may not even reach its full value}@} during {@{a fast 0–1–0 or 1–0–1 transition}@}, and only {@{stabilize after a run of several identical bits}@}. This results in {@{vertical closure of the eye}@}.

The image below shows {@{a 1.25 Gbit/s NRZ signal}@} after passing {@{through a lossy channel}@} – {@{an RG-188 coaxial cable}@} {@{approximately 12 feet \(3.7 m\) in length}@}. {@{This channel}@} has {@{loss increasing in a fairly linear fashion}@} {@{from 0.1 dB at DC to 9 dB at 6 GHz}@}.

{@{The top and bottom "rails"}@} of {@{the eye}@} show {@{the final voltage the signal reaches}@} after {@{several consecutive bits with the same value}@}. Since the channel has {@{minimal loss at DC}@}, {@{the maximum signal amplitude}@} is {@{largely unaffected}@}. Looking at {@{the rising edge of the signal \(a 0–1 pattern\)}@} we can see that {@{the signal starts to level off}@} {@{around −300 [ps](picosecond.md)}@}, but {@{continues to rise slowly over the duration of the UI}@}. At {@{around +300 ps}@}, the signal {@{either begins falling again \(a 0–1–0 pattern\)}@} or {@{continues rising slowly \(a 0–1–1 pattern\)}@}.

> {@{![Eye pattern of a 1.25 Gbit/s NRZ signal through a lossy channel](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Eye%20pattern%20LPF.png)}@}
>
> {@{Eye pattern}@} of {@{a 1.25 Gbit/s NRZ signal}@} through {@{a lossy channel}@}

As {@{high frequency losses increase}@} {@{the overall shape of the eye}@} gradually {@{degrades into a sinusoid}@} \(once {@{higher frequency harmonics of the data has been eliminated}@}, {@{all that remains}@} is {@{the fundamental}@}\) and {@{decreases in amplitude}@}.

### impedance mismatches

{@{Stubs, impedance mismatches}@}, and {@{other defects in a transmission line}@} can cause {@{[reflections](signal%20reflection.md)}@} visible as {@{defects in the edges of the signal}@}. {@{Reflections with a delay greater than one UI}@} often {@{render the eye completely unreadable}@} due to {@{[inter-symbol interference \(ISI\)](intersymbol%20interference.md)}@}, however {@{those with a shorter delay}@} can be easily {@{seen in the shape of the eye}@}.

In the image below, {@{a roughly 1-inch \(25 mm\) open circuited stub}@} is {@{present in the line}@}, causing {@{an initial low-impedance effect \(reduced amplitude\)}@} followed by {@{a positive reflection from the end of the stub}@} with {@{a delay of about 320 ps or 0.4 UIs}@}. This can be clearly seen as {@{a "step" in the rising edge}@} in which the signal {@{rises to a fraction of the full value}@}, {@{levels off for the round trip delay of the stub}@}, then {@{rises to its full value when the reflection arrives}@}.

> {@{![Eye pattern of a 1.25 Gbit/s NRZ signal with a one-inch stub](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Eye%20pattern%20mismatch.png)}@}
>
> {@{Eye pattern}@} of {@{a 1.25 Gbit/s NRZ signal}@} with {@{a one-inch stub}@}

In the image below, {@{an additional three inches of cable}@} is {@{added to the end of the same stub}@}. {@{The same "step" is present}@} but is now {@{four times as long}@}, producing {@{reflections at about 1280 ps or 1.6 UI}@}. This produces {@{extreme ISI}@} \(since {@{the reflection of each UI arrives during the subsequent UI}@}\) which {@{completely closes the eye}@}.
