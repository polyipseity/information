# X-ray burster

__X-ray bursters__ are {@{one class of [X-ray binary stars](x-ray%20binary.md) exhibiting __X-ray bursts__}@}, {@{periodic and rapid increases in [luminosity](luminosity.md) (typically a factor of 10 or greater) that peak in the [X-ray](x-ray.md) region of the [electromagnetic spectrum](electromagnetic%20spectrum.md)}@}. These astrophysical systems are {@{composed of an [accreting](accretion%20(astrophysics).md) [neutron star](neutron%20star.md) and a [main sequence](main%20sequence.md) companion 'donor' star}@}. There are {@{two types of X-ray bursts, designated I and II}@}. Type I bursts are {@{caused by thermonuclear runaway, while type II arise from the release of gravitational (potential) energy liberated through accretion}@}. For type I (thermonuclear) bursts, {@{the mass transferred from the donor star accumulates on the surface of the neutron star until it ignites and fuses in a burst, producing X-rays}@}. The behaviour of X-ray bursters is similar to {@{the behaviour of recurrent [novae](nova.md)}@}. In the latter case {@{the compact object is a [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md) that accretes [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) that finally undergoes explosive burning}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-17,214,330!2026-01-06,345,290!2025-04-23,185,310!2025-05-11,197,310!2025-04-23,160,250!2025-05-17,176,250!2025-05-20,214,310!2025-05-10,197,310-->
