# isomer

In [chemistry](chemistry.md), __isomers__ are {@{[molecules](molecule.md) or [polyatomic ions](polyatomic%20ion.md) with the same [molecular formula](chemical%20formula.md#molecular%20formula) but different spatial arrangements of [atoms](atom.md)}@}.

## structural isomer

__Structural isomers__ have {@{the same [molecular formula](chemical%20formula.md#molecular%20formula) but different [bonding](chemical%20bond.md) of [atoms](atom.md)}@}. They can be further categorized into {@{__skeletal isomers__ (__chain isomers__ if acyclic), __position isomers__, and __functional isomers__}@}. The first two have {@{similar [chemical properties](chemical%20property.md) but different [physical properties](physical%20property.md)}@}. The last one has {@{very different chemical and physical properties}@}.

## stereoisomers

__Stereoisomers__ have {@{the same [bonding](chemical%20bond.md) of [atoms](atom.md) but different shapes}@}. They can be further categorized into {@{___cis_–_trans_ isomers__ and __enantiomers__}@}. The first one has {@{different [physical properties](physical%20property.md)}@}. The last one has {@{similar physical properties}@}.

### _cis_–_trans_ isomers

_Cis_–_trans_ isomers have {@{different [polarities](chemical%20polarity.md), which affects [boiling points](boiling%20point.md) more, and different packing efficiencies, which affects [melting points](melting%20point.md) more}@}.

### enantiomers

Enantiomers are {@{optically active as they rotate the [plane of polarization](plane%20of%20polarization.md) of [polarized](polarization%20(physics).md) [light](light.md)}@} and can be measured by a {@{[polarimeter](polarimeter.md)}@}.
