# helium flash

A __helium flash__ is {@{a very brief [thermal runaway](thermal%20runaway.md) [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) of large quantities of [helium](helium.md) into [carbon](carbon.md) through the [triple-alpha process](triple-alpha%20process.md)}@} in {@{the core of low-mass [stars](star.md) (between 0.8 [solar masses](solar%20mass.md) ([M<sub>☉</sub>](solar%20mass.md)) and 2.0 M<sub>☉</sub>) during their [red giant](red%20giant.md) phase}@}. The [Sun](Sun.md) is predicted to {@{experience a flash 1.2 billion years after it leaves the [main sequence](main%20sequence.md)}@}. A much rarer runaway helium fusion process can also occur {@{on the surface of [accreting](accretion%20(astrophysics).md) [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md) stars}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-13,187,314!2025-01-25,109,230!2025-05-17,214,310!2026-07-04,526,310-->

Low-mass stars {@{do not produce enough [gravitational](gravity.md) pressure to initiate normal helium fusion}@}. As the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, {@{some of the helium left behind is instead compacted into [degenerate matter](degenerate%20matter.md), supported against [gravitational collapse](gravitational%20collapse.md) by [quantum mechanical](quantum%20mechanics.md) pressure rather than [thermal pressure](ideal%20gas%20law.md)}@}. Subsequent hydrogen shell fusion {@{further increases the mass of the core until it reaches temperature of approximately 100 million [kelvin](Kelvin.md), which is hot enough to initiate helium fusion (or "helium burning") in the core}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-08,162,314!2025-07-18,213,254!2025-07-06,221,254-->

However, a fundamental quality of degenerate matter is that {@{increases in temperature do not produce an increase in the pressure of the matter until the thermal pressure becomes so very high that it exceeds degeneracy pressure}@}. In main sequence stars, {@{[thermal expansion](hydrostatic%20equilibrium.md) regulates the core temperature}@}, but {@{in degenerate cores, this does not occur}@}. Helium fusion {@{increases the temperature, which increases the fusion rate}@}, which {@{further increases the temperature in a runaway reaction which quickly spans the entire core}@}. This produces {@{a flash of very intense helium fusion that lasts only a few minutes, but during that time, produces energy at a rate comparable to the entire [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md) galaxy}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-19,298,334!2025-05-05,209,330!2025-06-26,254,330!2025-03-22,172,310!2025-03-29,179,314!2025-10-28,337,310-->

In the case of normal low-mass stars, {@{the vast energy release causes much of the core to come out of degeneracy, allowing it to thermally expand}@}. This {@{consumes most of the total energy released by the helium flash, and any left-over energy is absorbed into the star's upper layers}@}. Thus the helium flash is {@{mostly undetectable by observation, and is described solely by astrophysical models}@}. After the core's expansion and cooling, {@{the star's surface rapidly cools and contracts in as little as 10&nbsp;000 years until it is roughly 2% of its former radius and luminosity}@}. It is estimated that {@{the electron-degenerate helium core weighs about 40% of the star mass and that 6% of the core is converted into carbon}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-14,296,334!2025-04-01,155,270!2025-04-04,183,314!2025-08-19,232,254!2025-04-02,169,270-->
