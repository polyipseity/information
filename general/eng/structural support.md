# structural support

## support structure

### roller support

A roller support prevents {@{vertical (relative to a support on the ground) translation}@}, but not {@{horizontal or lateral translation and rotation}@}. Its reaction force is {@{a single linear force perpendicular to the surface}@}.

A roller support is drawn as {@{a circle or a triangle with two or more circles underneath}@}.

Examples include {@{roller supports under an overhanging highway, wheels of a table with wheels}@}.

### pinned support

A pinned support prevents {@{translation in any direction}@}, but not {@{rotation}@}. Its reaction force is {@{a single linear force in any direction}@}.

A pinned support is drawn as {@{a triangle or a square with a circle in the middle}@}.

Examples include {@{a table leg pinned by a single screw only, joints of a truss}@}.

### fixed support

A fixed support prevents {@{translation and rotation in any direction}@}. Its reaction forces are {@{a single linear force in any direction and a [torque](torque.md)}@}.

A fixed support is {@{usually not drawn specifically and represented by being connected to a fixed wall or ground}@}.

Examples include {@{a computer monitor with a single non-rotatable support, fixed supports under a bridge}@}.

Note that the reaction [torque](torque.md) only makes sense when {@{you consider that the support is not a single ideal point, or otherwise the moment arm is always zero}@}.
