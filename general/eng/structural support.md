# structural support

## support structure

### roller support

A roller support prevents {@{vertical (relative to a support on the ground) translation}@}, but not {@{horizontal or lateral translation and rotation}@}. Its reaction force is {@{a single linear force perpendicular to the surface}@}. <!--SR:!2026-11-07,690,330!2026-04-29,524,310!2025-10-25,382,310-->

A roller support is drawn as {@{a circle or a triangle with two or more circles underneath}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-01,287,290-->

Examples include {@{roller supports under an overhanging highway, wheels of a table with wheels}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,239,330-->

### pinned support

A pinned support prevents {@{translation in any direction}@}, but not {@{rotation}@}. Its reaction force is {@{a single linear force in any direction}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-11,401,310!2025-03-03,204,310!2025-03-12,212,310-->

A pinned support is drawn as {@{a triangle or a square with a circle in the middle}@}. <!--SR:!2026-09-19,651,330-->

Examples include {@{a table leg pinned by a single screw only, joints of a truss}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-04,223,270-->

### fixed support

A fixed support prevents {@{translation and rotation in any direction}@}. Its reaction forces are {@{a single linear force in any direction and a [torque](torque.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-23,567,330!2026-05-14,508,310-->

A fixed support is {@{usually not drawn specifically and represented by being connected to a fixed wall or ground}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-22,176,310-->

Examples include {@{a computer monitor with a single non-rotatable support, fixed supports under a bridge}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-20,474,310-->

Note that the reaction [torque](torque.md) only makes sense when {@{you consider that the support is not a single ideal point, or otherwise the moment arm is always zero}@}. <!--SR:!2026-10-12,670,330-->
