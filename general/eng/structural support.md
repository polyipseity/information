# structural support

## support structure

### roller support

A roller support prevents {@{vertical (relative to a support on the ground) translation}@}, but not {@{horizontal or lateral translation and rotation}@}. Its reaction force is {@{a single linear force perpendicular to the surface}@}. <!--SR:!2026-11-07,690,330!2026-04-29,524,310!2030-04-23,1641,330-->

A roller support is drawn as {@{a circle or a triangle with two or more circles underneath}@}. <!--SR:!2028-09-28,1154,310-->

Examples include {@{roller supports under an overhanging highway, wheels of a table with wheels}@}. <!--SR:!2028-03-15,1086,350-->

### pinned support

A pinned support prevents {@{translation in any direction}@}, but not {@{rotation}@}. Its reaction force is {@{a single linear force in any direction}@}. <!--SR:!2030-08-27,1720,330!2027-07-30,879,330!2027-09-09,911,330-->

A pinned support is drawn as {@{a triangle or a square with a circle in the middle}@}. <!--SR:!2026-09-19,651,330-->

Examples include {@{a table leg pinned by a single screw only, joints of a truss}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-26,842,290-->

### fixed support

A fixed support prevents {@{translation and rotation in any direction}@}. Its reaction forces are {@{a single linear force in any direction and a [torque](torque.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-23,567,330!2026-05-14,508,310-->

A fixed support is {@{usually not drawn specifically and represented by being connected to a fixed wall or ground}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-22,546,310-->

Examples include {@{a computer monitor with a single non-rotatable support, fixed supports under a bridge}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-20,474,310-->

Note that the reaction [torque](torque.md) only makes sense when {@{you consider that the support is not a single ideal point, or otherwise the moment arm is always zero}@}. <!--SR:!2026-10-12,670,330-->
