# data

In common [usage](usage%20(language).md), __data__ (/ˈdeɪtə/, also [US](American%20English.md): /ˈdætə/) is {@{a collection of discrete or continuous [values](value%20(semiotics).md) that convey [information](information.md)}@}, describing {@{the [quantity](quantity.md), [quality](qualitative%20property.md), [fact](fact.md), [statistics](statistics.md), other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of [symbols](symbol.md) that may be further [interpreted formally](interpretation%20(logic).md)}@}. A __datum__ is {@{an individual value in a collection of data}@}. Data are usually {@{organized into [structures](structure.md) such as [tables](table%20(information).md) that provide additional context and meaning}@}, and may themselves be {@{used as data in larger structures}@}. Data may be [used](data%20(computer%20science).md) as {@{[variables](variable%20and%20attribute%20(research).md)}@} in a [computational process](computation.md). Data may represent {@{abstract ideas or concrete measurements}@}. Data are commonly used in {@{[scientific research](scientific%20method.md), [economics](economics.md), and virtually every other form of human organizational activity}@}. Examples of data sets include {@{price indices (such as the [consumer price index](consumer%20price%20index.md)), [unemployment rates](unemployment.md#measurement), [literacy](literacy.md) rates, and [census](census.md) data}@}. In this context, data represent {@{the raw facts and figures from which useful information can be extracted}@}. <!--SR:!2027-07-05,789,330!2025-11-29,323,290!2027-07-15,798,330!2028-04-26,1036,350!2029-06-17,1361,350!2026-11-08,558,310!2028-05-16,1052,350!2028-01-01,929,330!2026-05-31,476,310!2027-05-06,741,330-->
