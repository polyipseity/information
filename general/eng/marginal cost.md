# marginal cost

In {@{[economics](economics.md)}@}, {@{the __marginal cost__}@} is {@{the change in the [total cost](total%20cost.md) that arises when the quantity produced is increased}@}, i.e. {@{the [cost](cost.md) of producing additional quantity}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> In some contexts, it refers to {@{an increment of one unit of output}@}, and in others it refers to {@{the rate of change of total cost as output is increased by an infinitesimal amount}@}. As Figure 1 shows, the marginal cost is measured in {@{dollars per unit, whereas total cost is in dollars}@}, and the marginal cost is {@{the slope of the total cost, the rate at which it increases with output}@}. Marginal cost is different from {@{[average cost](average%20cost.md), which is the total cost divided by the number of units produced}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-22,308,352!2026-01-25,283,334!2025-11-03,217,332!2026-02-27,314,352!2025-12-23,257,334!2025-11-19,216,332!2026-04-13,349,352!2026-03-14,325,352!2026-02-25,312,352-->

At {@{each level of production and time period being considered}@}, marginal cost includes {@{all costs that vary with the level of production}@}, whereas {@{costs that do not vary with production are [fixed](fixed%20cost.md)}@}. For example, {@{the marginal cost of producing an automobile}@} will {@{include the costs of labor and parts needed for the additional automobile but not the [fixed cost](fixed%20cost.md) of the factory building that do not change with output}@}. The marginal cost can be {@{either short-run or long-run marginal cost}@}, depending on {@{what costs vary with output, since in the long run even building size is chosen to fit the desired output}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-26,313,352!2026-03-28,336,352!2025-09-22,182,314!2025-12-28,262,334!2026-03-30,315,312!2026-03-27,336,352!2025-10-15,199,332-->

If {@{the [cost function](cost%20curve.md) $C$ is continuous and [differentiable](differentiable%20function.md)}@}, {@{the marginal cost $MC$}@} is {@{the first derivative of the cost function with respect to the output quantity $Q$:<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> $$MC(Q)={\frac {\ dC}{\ dQ} }.$$}@} If {@{the cost function is not differentiable}@}, the marginal cost can be expressed as follows: {@{$$MC={\frac {\Delta C}{\Delta Q} },$$}@} where {@{$\Delta$ denotes an incremental change of one unit}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,314,352!2026-03-05,318,352!2026-03-13,324,352!2026-03-04,318,352!2026-04-06,343,352!2026-02-26,312,352-->

{@{Short run marginal cost}@} is {@{the change in total cost when an additional output is produced in the short run and some costs are fixed}@}. On the right side of the page, the short-run marginal cost forms {@{a U-shape, with quantity on the x-axis and cost per unit on the y-axis}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-27,313,352!2025-12-22,256,334!2025-10-14,199,332-->

On {@{the short run}@}, the firm has {@{some costs that are fixed independently of the quantity of output \(e.g. buildings, machinery\)}@}. {@{Other costs such as labor and materials}@} {@{vary with output, and thus show up in marginal cost}@}. The marginal cost {@{may first decline, as in the diagram, if the additional cost per unit is high, if the firm operates at too low a level of output}@}, or {@{it may start flat or rise immediately}@}. At some point, {@{the marginal cost rises}@} as {@{increases in the variable inputs such as labor put increasing pressure on the fixed assets such as the size of the building}@}. In {@{the long run}@}, the firm would {@{increase its fixed assets to correspond to the desired output}@}; the short run is {@{defined as the period in which those assets cannot be changed}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-22,308,352!2026-03-28,336,352!2026-03-18,328,352!2025-12-28,262,334!2025-07-27,136,312!2025-12-19,253,334!2026-03-21,331,352!2026-03-19,328,352!2026-04-08,345,352!2025-12-06,241,332!2025-09-20,180,314-->

{@{[The long run](long%20run%20and%20short%20run.md)}@} is defined as {@{the length of time in which no input is fixed}@}. {@{Everything, including building size and machinery}@}, can be {@{chosen optimally for the quantity of output that is desired}@}. As a result, even if {@{short-run marginal cost rises because of capacity constraints}@}, {@{long-run marginal cost can be constant}@}. Or, there may be {@{increasing or decreasing [returns to scale](returns%20to%20scale.md) if technological or management productivity changes with the quantity}@}. Or, there may be {@{both, as in the diagram at the right}@}, in which {@{the marginal cost first falls \(increasing returns to scale\) and then rises \(decreasing returns to scale\)}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-03-05,318,352!2026-03-20,329,352!2026-03-03,317,352!2025-11-27,221,332!2026-04-02,339,352!2026-04-06,343,352!2026-02-20,308,352!2025-12-20,254,334!2026-03-09,321,352-->

## cost functions and relationship to average cost

In the simplest case, {@{the total cost function and its [derivative](derivative.md)}@} are expressed as follows, where {@{Q represents the production quantity, VC represents variable costs, FC represents [fixed costs](fixed%20cost.md) and TC represents total costs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-19,354,352!2026-03-06,318,352-->

{@{Fixed costs}@} represent {@{the costs that do not change as the production quantity changes}@}. Fixed costs are costs incurred by things like {@{rent, building space, machines, etc.}@} {@{Variable costs}@} {@{change as the production quantity changes}@}, and are often {@{associated with labor or materials}@}. {@{The derivative of fixed cost}@} is {@{zero, and this term drops out of the marginal cost equation}@}: that is, {@{marginal cost _does not depend on_ fixed costs}@}. This can be {@{compared with [average total cost](average%20total%20cost.md) \(ATC\)}@}, which is {@{the total cost \(including fixed costs, denoted C<sub>0</sub>\) divided by the number of units produced: $$ATC={\frac {C_{0}+\Delta C}{Q} }.$$}@} For {@{discrete calculation without [calculus](calculus.md)}@}, marginal cost {@{equals the change in total \(or variable\) cost that comes with each additional unit produced}@}. Since {@{fixed cost does not change in the short run}@}, it has {@{no effect on marginal cost}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,257,334!2026-03-20,330,352!2026-04-14,350,352!2026-04-05,342,352!2025-11-23,219,332!2026-03-17,325,352!2026-03-24,333,352!2026-02-15,304,352!2026-04-02,339,352!2026-02-19,307,352!2026-03-13,324,352!2026-03-04,318,352!2025-11-27,221,332!2026-03-28,336,352!2026-03-14,325,352-->

For instance, suppose the total cost of {@{making 1 shoe is \$30 and the total cost of making 2 shoes is \$40}@}. The {@{marginal cost of producing shoes}@} {@{decreases from \$30 to \$10 with the production of the second shoe \(\$40 – \$30 = \$10\)}@}. In another example, when {@{a fixed cost is associated}@}, the marginal cost can be calculated as presented in the table below. <!--SR:!2026-03-20,330,352!2025-12-02,241,332!2026-04-14,350,352!2026-03-21,330,352-->

Marginal cost is {@{not the cost of producing the "next" or "last" unit}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> {@{The cost of the last unit}@} is {@{the same as the cost of the first unit and every other unit}@}. In {@{the short run}@}, {@{increasing production}@} requires {@{using more of the variable input — conventionally assumed to be labor}@}. {@{Adding more labor to a fixed capital stock}@} {@{reduces the marginal product of labor because of the [diminishing marginal returns](diminishing%20returns.md)}@}. {@{This reduction in productivity}@} is {@{not limited to the additional labor needed to produce the marginal unit – the productivity of every unit of labor is reduced}@}. Thus {@{the cost of producing the marginal unit of output has two components}@}: {@{the cost associated with producing the marginal unit}@} and {@{the increase in average costs for all units produced due to the "damage" to the entire productive process}@}. The first component is {@{the per-unit or average cost}@}. The second component is {@{the small increase in cost due to the law of diminishing marginal returns which increases the costs of all units sold}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-25,311,352!2026-02-26,312,352!2026-03-25,334,352!2026-03-24,332,352!2026-03-22,332,352!2025-12-23,257,334!2025-12-22,256,334!2025-11-14,223,332!2026-04-17,352,352!2026-03-04,317,352!2026-04-15,350,352!2026-04-18,353,352!2026-04-05,342,352!2025-12-24,258,334!2026-03-10,322,352-->

Marginal costs can also be expressed as {@{the cost per unit of labor divided by the marginal product of labor}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> Denoting {@{variable cost as VC, the constant wage rate as w, and labor usage as L}@}, we have {@{$$MC={\frac {\Delta VC}{\Delta Q} }$$ <br/> $$\Delta VC={w\Delta L}$$ <br/> $$MC={\frac {w\Delta L}{\Delta Q} }={\frac {w}{MPL} }.$$}@} Here {@{MPL is the ratio of increase in the quantity produced per unit increase in labour}@}: i.e. {@{ΔQ/ΔL, the [marginal product of labor](marginal%20product%20of%20labor.md)}@}. {@{The last equality holds}@} because {@{${\frac {\Delta L}{\Delta Q} }$ is the change in quantity of labor that brings about a one-unit change in output}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> Since {@{the wage rate is assumed constant}@}, {@{marginal cost and marginal product of labor have an inverse relationship}@}—if {@{the marginal product of labor is decreasing \(or, increasing\), then marginal cost is increasing \(decreasing\)}@}, and AVC = {@{VC/Q=wL/Q = w/\(Q/L\) = w/AP<sub>L</sub>}@} <!--SR:!2025-10-20,203,332!2026-03-10,322,352!2025-10-29,197,292!2026-03-27,336,352!2026-04-12,348,352!2026-03-28,336,352!2025-12-25,259,334!2026-02-23,310,352!2026-03-05,318,352!2025-09-26,174,312!2025-09-25,169,274-->

## empirical data on marginal cost

While {@{[neoclassical](neoclassical%20economics.md) models}@} {@{broadly assume that marginal cost will increase as production increases}@}, {@{several empirical studies conducted throughout the 20th century}@} {@{have concluded that the marginal cost is either constant or falling for the vast majority of firms}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> Most recently, {@{former [Federal Reserve](Federal%20Reserve.md) Vice-Chair [Alan Blinder](Alan%20Blinder.md) and colleagues}@} conducted a survey of {@{200 executives of corporations with sales exceeding \$10 million}@}, in which they were asked, {@{among other questions, about the structure of their marginal cost curves}@}. Strikingly, {@{just 11% of respondents answered that their marginal costs increased as production increased}@}, while {@{48% answered that they were constant, and 41% answered that they were decreasing}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup><sup>:&hairsp;106&hairsp;</sup> Summing up the results, they wrote: <!--SR:!2026-02-21,308,352!2026-04-11,347,352!2025-12-01,240,332!2026-03-18,328,352!2025-10-28,196,292!2026-03-27,336,352!2025-09-21,169,312!2026-03-09,321,352!2026-03-17,327,352-->

{@{Many [Post-Keynesian economists](post-Keynesian%20economics.md)}@} have {@{pointed to these results as evidence in favor of their own [heterodox](heterodox%20economics.md) theories of the firm}@}, which {@{generally assume that marginal cost is constant as production increases}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-04-12,348,352!2026-04-08,345,352!2026-03-26,335,352-->

## economies of scale

{@{[Economies of scale](economies%20of%20scale.md)}@} {@{apply to the long run}@}, {@{a span of time in which all inputs can be varied by the firm so that there are no fixed inputs or fixed costs}@}. Production may be {@{subject to economies of scale \(or [diseconomies of scale](diseconomies%20of%20scale.md)\)}@}. {@{Economies of scale are said to exist}@} if {@{an additional unit of output can be produced for less than the average of all previous units}@} – that is, {@{if long-run marginal cost is below long-run average cost, so the latter is falling}@}. Conversely, there may be {@{levels of production where marginal cost is higher than average cost}@}, and {@{the average cost is an increasing function of output}@}. Where {@{there are economies of scale}@}, {@{prices set at marginal cost will fail to cover total costs}@}, thus {@{requiring a subsidy}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> For {@{this generic case}@}, {@{minimum average cost occurs}@} at {@{the point where average cost and marginal cost are equal}@} \(when plotted, {@{the marginal cost curve intersects the average cost curve from below}@}\). <!--SR:!2026-03-26,335,352!2026-04-19,354,352!2026-08-13,414,312!2025-12-22,256,334!2026-02-27,313,352!2025-08-09,139,312!2025-11-29,238,332!2026-03-25,334,352!2026-02-19,305,352!2025-12-21,255,334!2026-04-09,346,352!2026-03-25,334,352!2025-12-23,257,334!2026-02-25,310,352!2026-03-03,317,352!2026-02-11,300,352-->

## perfectly competitive supply curve

This is {@{not true for firms operating in other market structures}@}. For example, while {@{a monopoly has an MC curve, it does not have a supply curve}@}.

## relationship to fixed costs

Marginal costs are {@{not affected by the level of fixed cost}@}. Marginal costs can be expressed as {@{∆C/∆Q}@}. Since {@{fixed costs do not vary with \(depend on\) changes in quantity}@}, MC is {@{∆VC/∆Q}@}. Thus if {@{fixed cost were to double, the marginal cost MC would not be affected}@}, and consequently, {@{the profit-maximizing quantity and price would not change}@}. This can be illustrated by {@{graphing the short run total cost curve and the short-run variable cost curve}@}. {@{The shapes of the curves}@} are identical. Each curve {@{initially increases at a decreasing rate, reaches an inflection point, then increases at an increasing rate}@}. The only difference between the curves is that {@{the SRVC curve begins from the origin while the SRTC curve originates on the positive part of the vertical axis}@}. {@{The distance of the beginning point of the SRTC above the origin}@} {@{represents the fixed cost – the vertical distance between the curves}@}. This distance {@{remains constant as the quantity produced, Q, increases}@}. MC is {@{the slope of the SRVC curve}@}. {@{A change in fixed cost}@} would be {@{reflected by a change in the vertical distance between the SRTC and SRVC curve}@}. Any such change would {@{have no effect on the shape of the SRVC curve and therefore its slope MC at any point}@}. {@{The changing law of marginal cost}@} is {@{similar to the changing law of average cost}@}. They are both {@{decrease at first with the increase of output, then start to increase after reaching a certain scale}@}. <!-- While -->Where {@{the output when marginal cost reaches its minimum}@} is {@{smaller than the average total cost and average variable cost}@}. When {@{the average total cost and the average variable cost reach their lowest point}@}, {@{the marginal cost is equal to the average cost}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,257,334!2026-01-24,282,334!2025-10-07,197,332!2026-04-12,348,352!2026-03-16,327,352!2025-10-26,208,332!2025-09-28,190,332!2026-02-15,300,334!2025-12-14,250,330!2026-03-01,315,352!2026-04-04,341,352!2025-09-06,159,312!2026-03-25,333,352!2026-02-24,309,352!2026-04-07,344,352!2025-11-26,235,332!2025-09-22,170,312!2026-02-14,302,352!2025-12-18,252,334!2026-03-24,333,352!2026-03-19,329,352!2026-03-05,318,352!2025-11-13,222,332!2026-03-22,330,352-->

## private versus social marginal cost

- Main article: [Social cost](social%20cost.md)

{@{Of great importance in the theory of marginal cost}@} is {@{the distinction between the marginal _private_ and _social_ costs}@}. {@{The marginal private cost}@} {@{shows the cost borne by the firm in question}@}. It is the marginal private cost that is used {@{by business decision makers in their [profit maximization](profit%20maximization.md) behavior}@}. {@{Marginal social cost is similar to private cost}@} in that it {@{includes the cost of private enterprise but _also_ any other cost \(or offsetting benefit\) to parties having no direct association with purchase or sale of the product}@}. It incorporates {@{all negative and positive [externalities](externalities.md), of both production and consumption}@}. Examples include {@{a social cost from air pollution affecting third parties}@} and {@{a social benefit from flu shots protecting others from infection}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,314,352!2026-04-02,339,352!2026-04-09,346,352!2026-02-23,309,352!2026-03-12,323,352!2026-04-03,340,352!2025-09-24,188,332!2025-09-23,180,314!2025-11-30,239,332!2026-03-23,331,352-->

{@{Externalities}@} are {@{costs \(or benefits\) that are not borne by the parties to the economic [transaction](financial%20transaction.md)}@}. A producer may, for example, {@{[pollute](pollution.md) the environment}@}, and {@{others may bear those costs}@}. A consumer may {@{consume a good which produces benefits for society, such as education}@}; because {@{the individual does not receive all of the benefits}@}, he may {@{consume less than efficiency would suggest}@}. Alternatively, {@{an individual may be a smoker or alcoholic}@} and {@{impose costs on others}@}. In these cases, {@{production or consumption of the good in question may differ from the optimum level}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-27,336,352!2026-04-06,343,352!2026-03-19,329,352!2026-04-09,346,352!2025-10-27,211,332!2026-02-15,303,352!2026-04-07,344,352!2026-02-26,311,352!2025-11-27,236,332!2026-03-23,332,352-->

{@{Much of the time}@}, private and social costs {@{do not diverge from one another}@}, but at times {@{social costs may be either greater or less than private costs}@}. When {@{the marginal social cost of production is greater than that of the private cost function}@}, there is {@{a [negative externality](negative%20externality.md#negative) of production}@}. {@{Productive processes that result in [pollution](pollution.md) or other environmental waste}@} are {@{textbook examples of production that creates negative externalities}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-23,309,352!2026-02-24,310,352!2026-03-02,316,352!2026-03-21,331,352!2025-12-24,258,334!2026-03-22,331,352!2025-12-22,256,334-->

Such externalities are a result of {@{firms externalizing their costs onto a third party in order to reduce their own total cost}@}. As a result of externalizing such costs, we see that {@{members of society who are not included in the firm will be negatively affected by such behavior of the firm}@}. In this case, {@{an increased cost of production in society}@} creates {@{a social cost curve that depicts a greater cost than the private cost curve}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-02,339,352!2026-04-14,350,352!2025-12-25,259,334!2026-12-10,512,314-->

In {@{an equilibrium state}@}, {@{markets creating negative externalities of production}@} will {@{overproduce that good}@}. As a result, {@{the socially optimal production level would be lower than that observed}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-03,340,352!2026-03-25,334,352!2025-12-24,258,334!2026-04-20,355,352-->

When {@{the marginal social cost of production is less than that of the private cost function}@}, there is {@{a [positive externality](positive%20externality.md#positive) of production}@}. {@{Production of [public goods](public%20good%20(economics).md)}@} is {@{a textbook example of production that creates positive externalities}@}. {@{An example of such a public good}@}, which creates {@{a divergence in social and private costs}@}, is {@{the production of [education](education.md)}@}. It is often seen that {@{education is a positive for any whole society}@}, as well as {@{a positive for those directly involved in the market}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-10,322,352!2026-04-14,350,352!2026-03-26,335,352!2026-03-03,317,352!2026-03-06,318,352!2026-03-19,329,352!2026-02-24,311,352!2025-12-27,261,334!2026-04-13,349,352-->

Such production creates {@{a social cost curve that is below the private cost curve}@}. In {@{an equilibrium state}@}, {@{markets creating positive externalities of production}@} will {@{underproduce their good}@}. As a result, {@{the socially optimal production level would be greater than that observed}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-20,329,352!2026-04-13,349,352!2026-03-17,327,352!2026-04-18,353,352!2026-04-18,353,352-->

## relationship between marginal cost and average total cost

{@{The marginal cost intersects with the average total cost and the average variable cost}@} {@{at their lowest point}@}. Take the \[Relationship between marginal cost and average total cost\] graph as a representation. <!--SR:!2025-09-23,187,332!2025-12-24,258,334-->

Say {@{the starting point of level of output produced is n}@}. {@{Marginal cost}@} is {@{the change of the total cost from an additional output \[\(n+1\)th unit\]}@}. Therefore, \(refer to "Average cost" labelled picture on the right side of the screen)... (annotation: $$AC_n = \frac {TC_n} {Q_n}$$ and the AC at the level $Q_{n + 1}$ is $$AC_{n + 1} = \frac {TC_{n + 1} } {Q_{n + 1} } \,.$$ Clearly, $$TC_{n + 1} = TC_n + MC \,.$$) <!--SR:!2026-02-09,298,352!2026-04-01,338,352!2026-03-21,331,352-->

> Average cost

In this case, when {@{the marginal cost of the \(n+1\)th unit is less than the average cost\(n\)}@}, {@{the average cost\(n+1\) will get a smaller value than average cost\(n\)}@}. It {@{goes the opposite way}@} when {@{the marginal cost of \(n+1\)th is higher than average cost\(n\)}@}. In this case, {@{the average cost\(n+1\) will be higher than average cost\(n\)}@}. If {@{the marginal cost is found lying under the average cost curve}@}, it will {@{bend the average cost curve downwards}@} and if {@{the marginal cost is above the average cost curve, it will bend the average cost curve upwards}@}. You can see the table above where {@{before the marginal cost curve and the average cost curve intersect}@}, {@{the average cost curve is downwards sloping}@}, however {@{after the intersection, the average cost curve is sloping upwards}@}. {@{The U-shape graph}@} {@{reflects the law of diminishing returns}@}. {@{A firm can only produce so much}@} <!-- but after -->{@{before the production of \(n+1\)th output reaches a minimum cost}@}, {@{the output produced after will only increase the average total cost}@} \(Nwokoye, Ebele & Ilechukwu, Nneamaka, 2018\). <!--SR:!2025-12-27,261,334!2026-03-15,326,352!2026-04-07,344,352!2026-03-06,318,352!2026-02-24,310,352!2026-03-28,336,352!2026-01-25,283,334!2026-03-08,319,352!2026-03-11,323,352!2026-04-09,345,352!2025-12-25,259,334!2026-03-02,316,352!2026-04-16,351,352!2026-02-19,306,352!2026-04-15,350,352!2025-11-30,239,332-->

## profit maximization

{@{The profit maximizing graph}@} on the right side of the page {@{represents optimal production quantity when both marginal cost and the marginal profit line intercepts}@}. The black line {@{represents the intersection where the profits are the greatest \(marginal revenue = marginal cost\)}@}. {@{The left side of the black vertical line marked as "profit-maximising quantity"}@} is {@{where the marginal revenue is larger than marginal cost}@}. If {@{a firm sets its production on the left side of the graph and decides to increase the output}@}, {@{the additional revenue per output obtained will exceed the additional cost per output}@}. From the "profit maximizing graph", we could observe that {@{the revenue covers both bar A and B}@}, meanwhile {@{the cost only covers B}@}. Of course A+B earns you a profit but {@{the increase in output to the point of MR=MC}@} {@{yields extra profit that can cover the revenue for the missing A}@}. The firm is recommended to {@{increase output to reach the point of \(marginal revenue=marginal cost\)}@} \(Theory and Applications of Microeconomics, 2012\). <!--SR:!2026-03-20,330,352!2025-09-23,171,312!2026-03-18,326,352!2026-02-20,306,352!2025-12-21,255,334!2026-02-13,301,352!2025-11-22,228,332!2026-02-18,306,352!2025-12-21,255,334!2026-04-08,345,352!2026-03-21,331,352!2026-04-11,347,352-->

On the other hand, {@{the right side of the black line \(Marginal revenue = marginal cost\)}@}, shows that {@{marginal cost is more than marginal revenue}@}. Suppose {@{a firm sets its output on this side}@}, if {@{it reduces the output, the cost will decrease from C and D which exceeds the decrease in revenue which is D}@}. Therefore, {@{decreasing output until the point of \(marginal revenue=marginal cost\)}@} will {@{lead to an increase in profit}@} \(Theory and Applications of Microeconomics, 2012\). <!--SR:!2026-02-16,304,352!2025-12-21,255,334!2026-02-27,312,352!2025-09-06,167,314!2026-04-10,346,352!2025-12-26,260,334-->
