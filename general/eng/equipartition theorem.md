# equipartition theorem

The equipartition theorem is inaccurate when {@{[quantum effects](quantum%20mechanics.md) are significant, like at low [temperatures](temperature.md)}@}. This is caused by {@{some [degrees of freedom](degrees%20of%20freedom%20(physics%20and%20chemistry).md) "freezing out" because the [thermal energy](thermal%20energy.md) $k_\text{B}T$ is less than the quantum energy spacing of that particular degree of freedom}@}. <!--SR:!2028-05-04,1246,350!2028-08-28,1256,310-->
