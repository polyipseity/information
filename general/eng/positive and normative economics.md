# positive and normative economics

- For a broader discussion of the same idea in philosophy, see [fact–value distinction](fact–value%20distinction.md).

In {@{the [philosophy of economics](philosophy%20and%20economics.md)}@}, a __descriptive__ or __positive statement__ is {@{an assertion about [facts](fact.md) of the world}@}, while __prescriptive__ or __normative statements__ express {@{[value judgments](value%20(ethics%20and%20social%20sciences).md)}@}. The former describe {@{the world _as it is_}@}, while the latter talk about {@{the world _as it should be_}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> The methodological basis for positive/normative distinction is rooted in {@{the [fact-value distinction](fact–value%20distinction.md) in philosophy}@}.

Economics is often {@{divided into __positive__ and __normative economics__}@}. Positive economics {@{focuses on the description, quantification and explanation of economic phenomena}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> Normative statements about economics often {@{take the form of discussions about [fairness](equity%20(economics).md)}@} and what the outcome of {@{the economy or goals of [public policy](public%20policy.md) _ought to be_}@},<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> as well as prescriptions regarding {@{[rational choice](rational%20choice%20theory.md), as studied in [decision theory](decision%20theory.md)}@}.
