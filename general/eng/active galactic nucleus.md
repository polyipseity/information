# active galactic nucleus

{@{An __active galactic nucleus__ (__AGN__)}@} is {@{a compact region at the center of a [galaxy](galaxy.md) that emits a significant amount of energy across the [electromagnetic spectrum](electromagnetic%20spectrum.md), with characteristics indicating that this luminosity is not produced by the [stars](star.md)}@}. Such excess, non-stellar emissions have been observed {@{in the [radio](radio%20wave.md), [microwave](microwave.md), [infrared](infrared.md), [optical](visible%20spectrum.md), [ultra-violet](ultraviolet.md), [X-ray](X-ray.md) and [gamma ray](gamma%20ray.md) wavebands}@}. A galaxy hosting an AGN is {@{called an __active galaxy__}@}. The non-stellar radiation from an AGN is theorized to {@{result from the [accretion](accretion%20(astrophysics).md) of matter by a [supermassive black hole](supermassive%20black%20hole.md) at the center of its host galaxy}@}. <!--SR:!2028-09-27,1167,350!2025-12-12,318,290!2026-08-17,453,270!2029-01-17,1254,350!2027-11-23,894,330-->

Active galactic nuclei are {@{the most luminous persistent sources of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) in the universe}@} and, as such, can be {@{used as a means of discovering distant objects}@}; their evolution {@{as a function of cosmic time also puts constraints on [models of the cosmos](cosmology.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-03-13,1297,350!2027-05-29,763,330!2028-09-24,1166,350-->

The observed characteristics of an AGN depend on {@{several properties such as the mass of the central black hole, the rate of gas accretion onto the black hole, the orientation of the [accretion disk](accretion%20disk.md), the degree of [obscuration](extinction%20(astronomy).md) of the nucleus by [dust](cosmic%20dust.md), and presence or absence of [jets](astrophysical%20jet.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-06-01,690,270-->

{@{Numerous subclasses of AGN}@} have been defined on {@{the basis of their observed characteristics}@}; {@{the most powerful AGN}@} are classified as {@{[quasars](quasar.md)}@}. {@{A [blazar](blazar.md)}@} is {@{an AGN with a jet pointed toward the Earth, in which radiation from the jet is enhanced by [relativistic beaming](relativistic%20beaming.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-30,1334,350!2027-06-22,794,330!2026-08-22,540,310!2027-11-27,898,330!2027-08-16,832,330!2027-06-18,789,330-->

## unification of AGN species

{@{Unified models}@} propose that {@{different observational classes of AGN are a single type of physical object observed under different conditions}@}. {@{The currently favoured unified models}@} are {@{'orientation-based unified models'}@} meaning that they propose that {@{the apparent differences between different types of objects}@} {@{arise simply because of their different orientations to the observer}@}. However, they are {@{debated}@} \(see below\). <!--SR:!2028-04-07,1021,341!2029-12-10,1521,361!2030-01-02,1539,361!2025-10-31,19,345!2025-10-31,19,345!2025-10-31,19,345!2025-10-31,19,345-->
