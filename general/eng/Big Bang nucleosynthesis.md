# Big Bang nucleosynthesis

In [physical cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md), __Big Bang nucleosynthesis__ (also known as __primordial nucleosynthesis__, and abbreviated as __BBN__) is {@{the production of [nuclei](atomic%20nucleus.md) other than those of the lightest [isotope](isotope.md) of [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) ([hydrogen-1](isotopes%20of%20hydrogen.md#hydrogen-1%20(protium)), <sup>1</sup>H, having a single [proton](proton.md) as a nucleus) during the early phases of the [universe](universe.md)}@}. This type of [nucleosynthesis](nucleosynthesis.md) is thought by most cosmologists to have occurred {@{from 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the [Big Bang](Big%20Bang.md)}@}. It is thought to be responsible for {@{the formation of most of the universe's [helium](helium.md) (as [isotope](isotopes%20of%20helium.md) [helium-4](helium-4.md) (<sup>4</sup>He)), along with small fractions of the hydrogen isotope [deuterium](deuterium.md) (<sup>2</sup>H or D), the [helium](helium.md) isotope [helium-3](helium-3.md) (<sup>3</sup>He), and a very small fraction of the [lithium](lithium.md) isotope [lithium-7](isotopes%20of%20lithium.md#lithium-7) (<sup>7</sup>Li)}@}. In addition to these stable nuclei, {@{two unstable or [radioactive](radionuclide.md) isotopes were produced}@}: {@{the heavy [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) isotope [tritium](tritium.md) (<sup>3</sup>H or T) and the [beryllium](beryllium.md) isotope [beryllium-7](isotopes%20of%20beryllium.md#beryllium-7) (<sup>7</sup>Be)}@}. These [unstable isotopes](radionuclide.md) later {@{decayed into <sup>3</sup>He and <sup>7</sup>Li, respectively, as above}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-01,292,330!2025-10-22,290,290!2025-09-08,275,290!2027-04-09,693,290!2026-11-20,562,270!2026-05-16,421,290-->

Elements {@{heavier than lithium}@} are thought to have been {@{created later in the life of the universe by [stellar nucleosynthesis](stellar%20nucleosynthesis.md), through the formation, evolution and death of stars}@}. <!--SR:!2027-11-08,879,330!2025-07-18,257,330-->
