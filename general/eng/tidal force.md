# tidal force

The __tidal force__ or __tide-generating force__ is {@{a [gravitational](gravity.md) effect that stretches a [body](physical%20object.md) along the line towards and away from the [center of mass](center%20of%20mass.md) of another body due to spatial variations in strength in [gravitational field](gravitational%20field.md) from the other body}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-20,141,290-->

## explanation

When a body (body 1) is {@{acted on by the [gravity](gravity.md) of another body (body 2)}@}, the [gravitational field](gravitational%20field.md) can {@{vary significantly on body 1 between the side of the body facing body 2 and the side facing away from body 2}@}. By {@{subtracting the gravitational acceleration of the [center of mass](center%20of%20mass.md) of body 1 from the gravitational acceleration of every point of body 1}@}, {@{a stretching effect along the line joining the center of mass of body 2}@} can be seen. These are the _tidal forces_. <!--SR:!2025-03-01,163,310!2026-03-31,448,310!2025-05-06,218,330!2025-03-24,180,310-->
