# nova

A __nova__ (pl. __novae__ or __novas__) is {@{a [transient astronomical event](time-domain%20astronomy.md) that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently "new" star (hence the name "nova", Latin for "new") that slowly fades over weeks or months}@}. All observed novae involve {@{[white dwarfs](white%20dwarf.md) in close [binary systems](binary%20star.md)}@}, but causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova {@{vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars}@}. The main sub-classes of novae are {@{classical novae, recurrent novae (RNe), and [dwarf novae](dwarf%20nova.md)}@}. They are all considered to be {@{[cataclysmic variable stars](cataclysmic%20variable%20star.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-14,509,290!2026-04-03,451,310!2028-02-14,997,350!2027-06-20,746,290!2026-12-20,593,270-->

Classical nova eruptions are {@{the most common type}@}. This type is usually created in {@{a close binary star system consisting of a white dwarf and either a [main sequence](main%20sequence.md), [subgiant](subgiant.md), or [red giant star](red%20giant.md)}@}. If {@{the orbital period of the system is a few days or less}@}, the white dwarf is {@{close enough to its companion star to draw [accreted](accretion%20(astrophysics).md) matter onto its surface, creating a dense but shallow [atmosphere](stellar%20atmosphere.md)}@}. This atmosphere, mostly consisting of {@{hydrogen}@}, is {@{heated by the hot white dwarf and eventually reaches a critical temperature, causing ignition of rapid [runaway](thermal%20runaway.md) [fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md)}@}. The sudden increase in energy expels {@{the atmosphere into interstellar space, creating the envelope seen as visible light during the nova event}@}. In past centuries {@{such an event was thought to be a new star}@}. A few novae produce {@{short-lived [nova remnants](nova%20remnant.md), lasting for perhaps several centuries}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-29,1157,350!2027-07-01,808,330!2026-03-26,443,310!2025-11-25,349,310!2026-12-20,656,330!2027-06-18,756,290!2027-08-17,795,330!2026-10-03,549,310!2028-10-21,1090,290-->

{@{A recurrent nova}@} involves {@{the same processes as a classical nova}@}, except that the nova event {@{repeats in cycles of a few decades or less}@} as {@{the companion star again feeds the dense atmosphere of the white dwarf after each ignition}@}, as in the star {@{[T Coronae Borealis](T%20Coronae%20Borealis.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-03-14,867,290!2028-01-30,862,290-->
