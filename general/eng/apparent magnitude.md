# apparent magnitude

__Apparent magnitude__ ({@{___m___}@}) is {@{a measure of the [brightness](irradiance.md) of a [star](star.md) or other [astronomical object](astronomical%20object.md)}@}. An object's apparent magnitude depends on {@{its intrinsic [luminosity](luminosity.md), its distance, and any [extinction](extinction%20(astronomy).md) of the object's light caused by [interstellar dust](cosmic%20dust.md) along the [line of sight](line%20of%20sight.md) to the observer}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-21,279,330!2025-01-02,108,297!2025-06-19,254,337-->

The word _magnitude_ in [astronomy](astronomy.md), unless stated otherwise, usually refers to {@{a celestial object's apparent magnitude}@}. The magnitude scale dates to {@{before the ancient Roman astronomer [Claudius Ptolemy](Ptolemy.md),}@} whose star catalog popularized the system by {@{listing [stars](star.md) from [1st magnitude](first-magnitude%20star.md) (brightest) to 6th magnitude (dimmest)}@}. The modern scale was {@{mathematically defined in a way to closely match this historical system}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-05,319,337!2025-05-07,211,310!2025-05-24,234,337!2025-04-05,191,317-->

The scale is {@{reverse [logarithmic](logarithmic%20scale.md)}@}: {@{the brighter an object is, the lower its [magnitude](magnitude%20(astronomy).md) number}@}. A difference of 1.0 in magnitude corresponds to {@{a brightness ratio of $\sqrt[5]{100}$, or about 2.512}@}. For example, a star of magnitude 2.0 is {@{2.512 times as bright}@} as a star of magnitude 3.0, {@{6.31 times as bright}@} as a star of magnitude 4.0, and {@{100 times as bright}@} as one of magnitude 7.0. <!--SR:!2025-08-13,301,337!2025-06-17,252,330!2025-01-05,111,290!2025-01-11,114,290!2025-10-25,312,297!2025-09-09,321,337-->
