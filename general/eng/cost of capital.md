In {@{[economics](economics.md) and [accounting](accounting.md)}@}, {@{the __cost of capital__}@} is {@{the cost of a company's funds \(both [debt](debt.md) and [equity](equity%20(finance).md)\)}@}, or from {@{an investor's point of view}@} is {@{"the [required rate of return](required%20rate%20of%20return.md#discount%20rate) on a portfolio company's existing securities"}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> It is used to {@{evaluate new projects of a company}@}. It is the minimum {@{return that investors expect for providing capital to the company}@}, thus setting {@{a benchmark that a new project has to meet}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270-->

## basic concept

For {@{an investment to be worthwhile}@}, {@{the expected [return on capital](return%20on%20capital.md)}@} has to be {@{higher than the cost of [capital](capital%20(economics).md)}@}. Given {@{a number of competing investment opportunities}@}, investors are expected to {@{put their capital to work in order to maximize the return}@}. In other words, the cost of capital is {@{the rate of return that capital could be expected to earn in the best alternative investment of equivalent risk}@}; this is {@{the [opportunity cost](opportunity%20cost.md) of capital}@}. If {@{a project is of similar risk to a company's average business activities}@} it is reasonable to {@{use the company's average cost of capital as a basis for the evaluation or cost of capital}@} as {@{a firm's cost of raising funds}@}. However, for {@{projects outside the core business of the company}@}, {@{the current cost of capital may not be the appropriate yardstick to use}@}, as {@{the risks of the businesses are not the same}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270-->

{@{A company's securities}@} typically {@{include both debt and equity}@}; one must therefore {@{calculate both the cost of debt and the cost of equity}@} to {@{determine a company's cost of capital}@}. Importantly, both {@{cost of debt and equity must be forward looking}@}, and reflect {@{the expectations of risk and return in the future}@}. This means, for instance, that {@{the past cost of debt is not a good indicator of the actual forward looking cost of debt}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270-->

Once {@{cost of debt and cost of equity have been determined}@}, {@{their blend, the [weighted average cost of capital](weighted%20average%20cost%20of%20capital.md) \(WACC\)}@}, can be calculated. This WACC can then be used as {@{a [discount rate](annual%20effective%20discount%20rate.md) for a project's projected free cash flows to the firm}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290-->

## example

Suppose a company considers {@{taking on a project or investment of some kind}@}, for example {@{installing a new piece of machinery in one of their factories}@}. {@{Installing this new machinery}@} will {@{cost money}@}; {@{paying the technicians to install the machinery, transporting the machinery, buying the parts}@} and so on. This new machinery is also expected to {@{generate new profit}@} \(otherwise, assuming {@{the company is interested in profit}@}, the company {@{would not consider the project in the first place}@}\). So the company will {@{finance the project with two broad categories of finance}@}: issuing {@{[debt](debt.md), by taking out a loan or other debt instrument}@} such as {@{a [bond](bond%20(finance).md)}@}; and issuing {@{[equity](equity%20(finance).md), usually by issuing new [shares](share%20(finance).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270-->

{@{The new debt-holders and shareholders}@} who have {@{decided to invest in the company to fund this new machinery}@} will {@{expect a return on their investment}@}: debt-holders require {@{[interest](interest.md) payments}@} and shareholders require {@{[dividends](dividend.md) \(or [capital gain](capital%20gain.md) from selling the shares after their value increases\)}@}. The idea is that {@{some of the profit generated by this new project}@} will be {@{used to repay the debt and satisfy the new shareholders}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270-->

Suppose that {@{one of the sources of finance for this new project}@} was {@{a [bond](bond%20(finance).md) \(issued at [par value](par%20value.md)\) of \$200,000 with an interest rate of 5%}@}. This means that the company would {@{issue the bond to some willing investor}@}, who would {@{give the \$200,000 to the company}@} which it could then {@{use, for a specified period of time \(the term of the bond\) to finance its project}@}. The company would also {@{make regular payments to the investor of 5% of the original amount they invested \(\$10,000\)}@}, at {@{a yearly or monthly rate depending on the specifics of the bond}@} \(these are called {@{coupon payments}@}\). At {@{the end of the lifetime of the bond \(when the bond [matures](bond%20(finance).md#maturity)\)}@}, the company would {@{return the \$200,000 they borrowed}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270-->

Suppose {@{the bond had a lifetime of ten years}@} and {@{coupon payments were made yearly}@}. This means that {@{the investor would receive \$10,000 every year for ten years}@}, and then finally {@{their \$200,000 back at the end of the ten years}@}. From {@{the investor's point of view}@}, {@{their investment of \$200,000}@} would be {@{regained at the end of the ten years \(entailing zero gain or loss\)}@}, but they would have _also_ {@{gained from the coupon payments}@}; {@{the \$10,000 per year for ten years}@} would amount to {@{a net gain of \$100,000 to the investor}@}. This is the amount that {@{compensates the investor for taking the risk of investing in the company}@} \(since, if {@{it happens that the project fails completely and the company goes bankrupt}@}, there is a chance that {@{the investor does not get their money back}@}\). <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270-->

{@{This net gain of \$100,000}@} was {@{paid by the company to the investor}@} as {@{a reward for investing their money in the company}@}. In essence, this is {@{how much the company paid to borrow \$200,000}@}. It was {@{the _cost_ of raising \$200,000 of new capital}@}. So to {@{raise \$200,000 the company had to pay \$100,000 out of their profits}@}; thus we say that {@{the _cost of debt_ in this case was 50%}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270-->

Theoretically, if {@{the company were to raise further capital by issuing more of the same bonds}@}, the new investors would {@{also expect a 50% return on their investment}@} \(although in practice {@{the required return varies}@} depending on {@{the size of the investment, the lifetime of the loan, the risk of the project}@} and so on\). <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290-->

{@{The cost of equity}@} follows {@{the same principle}@}: the investors {@{expect a certain return from their investment}@}, and the company {@{must pay this amount in order for the investors to be willing to invest in the company}@}. \(Although the cost of equity is {@{calculated differently}@} since {@{dividends, unlike interest payments}@}, are {@{not necessarily a fixed payment or a legal requirement}@}.\) <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270-->

## cost of debt

When companies {@{borrow funds from outside lenders}@}, {@{the interest paid on these funds}@} is called {@{the cost of debt}@}. The cost of debt is computed by {@{taking the rate on a [risk-free bond](risk-free%20bond.md)}@} whose {@{duration matches the [term structure](term%20structure.md) of the corporate debt}@}, then adding {@{a [default premium](risk%20premium.md)}@}. {@{This default premium}@} will {@{rise as the amount of debt increases}@} \(since, {@{all other things being equal}@}, the risk {@{rises as the cost of debt rises}@}\). Since in most cases {@{debt expense is a [deductible expense](deductible%20expense.md)}@}, the cost of debt is {@{computed on an after-tax basis}@} to {@{make it comparable with the cost of equity}@} \(earnings are {@{[taxed](taxed.md) as well}@}\). Thus, for {@{profitable firms}@}, debt is {@{[discounted](discounted.md) by the tax rate}@}. The formula can be written as {@{$$K_{D}=(R_{f}+{\text{credit risk rate} })(1-T) \,,$$}@} where {@{$T$ is the corporate tax rate and $R_{f}$ is the risk free rate}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270-->

- Main article: ::@:: [Cost of equity](cost%20of%20equity.md) <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290-->

{@{The [cost](cost.md) of equity}@} is {@{_inferred_ by comparing the investment to other investments \(comparable\) with similar risk profiles}@}. It is commonly computed using {@{the [capital asset pricing model](capital%20asset%20pricing%20model.md) formula}@}: <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270-->

### expected return

{@{The expected return \(or required rate of return for investors\)}@} can be calculated with {@{the "[dividend capitalization](dividend%20discount%20model.md) model"}@}, which is {@{$$K_{cs}={\frac { {\text{Dividend} }_{\text{Payment/Share} }(1+{\text{Growth} })}{ {\text{Price} }_{\text{Market} } } }+{\text{Growth} }_{\text{rate} } \,.$$}@} <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270-->

### comments

The models state that investors will {@{expect a return that is the [risk-free return](risk-free%20return.md)}@} plus {@{the security's sensitivity to [market risk](market%20risk.md) \(Î²\) times the market risk premium}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270-->

The risk premium {@{varies over time and place}@}, but in {@{some [developed countries](developed%20countries.md) during the twentieth century}@} it has averaged {@{around 5%}@} whereas in {@{the emerging markets}@}, it can be {@{as high as 7%}@}. {@{The equity market real [capital gain](capital%20gain.md) return}@} has been {@{about the same as annual real GDP growth}@}. The capital gains on {@{the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](Dow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average.md)}@} have been {@{1.6% per year over the period 1910â2005}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> The dividends have {@{increased the total "real" return on average equity to the double}@}, {@{about 3.2%}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290-->

{@{The sensitivity to market risk \(Î²\)}@} is {@{unique for each firm}@} and depends on {@{everything from management to its business and [capital structure](capital%20structure.md)}@}.

#### cost of retained earnings/cost of internal equity

Note that {@{[retained earnings](retained%20earnings.md)}@} are {@{a component of equity}@}, and, therefore, {@{the cost of retained earnings \(internal equity\)}@} is {@{equal to the cost of equity as explained above}@}. {@{Dividends \(earnings that are paid to investors and not retained\)}@} are {@{a component of the return on capital to equity holders}@}, and {@{influence the cost of capital through that mechanism}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,290-->

{@{The weighted cost of capital \(WACC\)}@} is {@{used in finance}@} to {@{measure a firm's cost of capital}@}. WACC is not {@{dictated by management}@}. Rather, it represents {@{the minimum return that a company must earn on an existing asset base}@} to {@{satisfy its creditors, owners, and other providers of capital}@}, or they {@{will invest elsewhere}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270-->

{@{The total capital for a firm}@} is {@{the value of its equity}@} \(for a firm {@{without outstanding [warrants](warrant%20(finance).md) and [options](option%20(finance).md)}@}, this is {@{the same as the company's [market capitalization](market%20capitalization.md)}@}\) plus {@{the cost of its debt}@} \(the cost of debt should be {@{continually updated as the cost of debt changes}@} as {@{a result of interest rate changes}@}\). Notice that {@{the "equity" in the [debt to equity ratio](debt%20to%20equity%20ratio.md)}@} is {@{the market value of all equity}@}, not {@{the [shareholders' equity](shareholders'%20equity.md) on the balance sheet}@}. To {@{calculate the firm's weighted cost of capital}@}, we must first {@{calculate the costs of the individual financing sources}@}: {@{Cost of Debt, Cost of Preference Capital, and Cost of Equity Cap}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270-->

### capital structure

- Main article: ::@:: [Capital structure](capital%20structure.md) <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270-->

Because of {@{tax advantages on debt issuance}@}, it will be {@{cheaper to issue debt rather than new equity}@} \(this is {@{only true for profitable firms}@}, tax breaks are {@{available only to profitable firms}@}\). At {@{some point}@}, however, {@{the cost of issuing new debt}@} will be {@{greater than the cost of issuing new equity}@}. This is because {@{adding debt}@} increases {@{the [default risk](default%20risk.md)}@} â and thus {@{the [interest rate](interest%20rate.md) that the company must pay in order to borrow money}@}. By {@{utilizing too much debt in its capital structure}@}, {@{this increased default risk}@} can also {@{drive up the costs for other sources}@} \(such as {@{retained earnings and preferred stock}@}\) as well. Management must {@{identify the "optimal mix" of financing}@} â {@{the [capital structure](capital%20structure.md)}@} where {@{the cost of capital is minimized}@} so that {@{the firm's value can be maximized}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270!2025-07-09,4,290!2025-07-09,4,270-->
