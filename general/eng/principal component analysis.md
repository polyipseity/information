# principal component analysis

## overview

PCA is most commonly used when {@{many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce the number of variables (e.g. accuracy, efficiency)}@}. PCA allows us to {@{reduce the number of dimensions in the data set while minimizing information loss}@}.

## intuition

PCA can be thought of {@{fitting an (hyper)[ellipsoid](ellipsoid.md) (a (hyper)[sphere](sphere.md) that are scaled differently along different axes) to the data}@}, where each axis {@{of the ellipsoid (which are perpendicular to each other) represents a principal component}@}. The axis {@{length represents the variance of the data along that axis}@}. Axes with the least length means {@{the data does not differ much in said axis}@}, thus removing said axes {@{reduces dimensionality while minimizing information loss}@}.

## computing PCA using the covariance method

The following is a detailed description of PCA using {@{the covariance method as opposed to the correlation method}@}.

The goal is to {@{transform a given data set __X__ of dimension _p_ to another data set __Y__ of dimension _l_, where $p \ge l$}@}. Equivalently, matrix __Y__ is {@{the [Karhunen–Loève transform](Kosambi–Karhunen–Loève%20theorem.md) (KLT) of matrix __X__}@}: {@{$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbb{KLT}\{\mathbf{X}\}$$}@}

    - Suppose you have a set of {@{_n_ observations of _p_ variables}@}, and you want to {@{reduce the data set to only $l \le p$ variables}@}.
    - Make the matrix __X__ by {@{writing the _n_ observations $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n$ each as a row vector with _p_ elements}@}, and then {@{combine the row vectors vertically to make a _n_ × _p_ matrix}@}.

    - Find {@{the mean vector __u__ of the _n_ observations}@}: {@{$$\mathbf{u} = \frac 1 n \sum_{i = 1}^n \mathbf{x}_i$$}@}. That is, each column of matrix __X__ is {@{summed up and divided by _n_ to make a 1 × _p_ row vector}@}.

    - Subtract {@{the mean vector __u__ from each row of the data matrix __X__ to get another _n_ × _p_ matrix __B__}@}: {@{$$\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{X} - \mathbf{h} \mathbf{u}$$, where $\mathbf{h}$ is a _n_ × 1 column vector with all values 1 ($\mathbf{h}$ simply duplicates the mean vector __u__)}@}.
    - In some applications, each variable of matrix __B__ may be {@{scaled to have a variance equal to 1}@}. This affects {@{the calculated principal components}@}, but makes them {@{independent of the measurement units}@}.

    - Find {@{the _p_ × _p_ empirical [covariance matrix](covariance%20matrix.md) __C__ from matrix __B__}@}: {@{$$\mathbf{C} = \frac 1 {n - 1} \mathbf{B}^* \mathbf{B}$$}@}
    - $*$ is {@{the [conjugate transpose](conjugate%20transpose.md) operator}@}. If __B__ {@{consists of real numbers only}@}, which is true for most applications, then $*$ is {@{the same as the regular [transpose](transpose.md) $\intercal$}@}.
    - $n - 1$ is used instead of _n_ to calculate the covariance because of {@{[Bessel's correction](Bessel's%20correction.md)}@}.

    - Compute {@{the _p_ × _p_ matrix __V__ of [eigenvectors](eigenvalues%20and%20eigenvectors.md) which [diagonalizes](diagonalizable%20matrix.md) the covariance matrix __C__ into its corresponding _p_ × _p_ [diagonal matrix](diagonal%20matrix.md) __D__ of [eigenvalues](eigenvalues%20and%20eigenvectors.md) (the eigenvalues are stored in the diagonals)}@}: {@{$$\mathbf{V}^{-1} \mathbf{C} \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{D}$$}@}.
    - Ensure the [eigenvectors](eigenvalues%20and%20eigenvectors.md) are {@{normalized so that their lengths are 1}@}.
    - The step would likely involve {@{a computer-based algorithm for [computing eigenvectors and eigenvalues](eigendecomposition%20of%20a%20matrix.md)}@}. For few dimensions, the eigenvalues may be [calculated directly](eigenvalues%20and%20eigenvectors.md#classical%20method).

    - Sort {@{the columns of the eigenvector matrix __V__ and eigenvalue matrix __D__ in order of _decreasing_ eigenvalue}@}.
    - Make sure {@{the pairings between the 2 matrices are maintained}@}.

7. __<!--pytextgen generate section="dd01"--><!-- The following content is generated at 2024-06-11T22:43:08.410586+08:00. Any edits will be overridden! -->compute the cumulative variance for each eigenvector<!--/pytextgen-->__
    - The eigenvalues {@{represent the distribution of the data's variance among each of the eigenvector}@}. The cumulative variance _g_ for the _j_-th eigenvector is {@{simply the sum of the eigenvalues from the 1st to the _j_-th eigenvector}@}: {@{$$g_j = \sum_{i = 1}^j \mathbf{D}_{ii} \quad \forall j \in \set{1, \ldots, p}$$}@}

    - Use the cumulative variances as {@{a guide for choosing an appropriate value for the number of reduced dimensions _l_}@}. The goal is to {@{choose the smallest _l_ possible while ensuring the _l_-th cumulative variance _g<sub>l</sub>_ is reasonably high on a percentage basis}@}. For example, {@{one can choose the smallest _l_ such that $\frac {g_l} {g_p} \ge 0.9$}@}.
    - After choosing _l_ (or _l_ is given beforehand), only keep {@{the first _l_ columns of the eigenvector _V_ to make a _p_ × _l_ matrix __W__ and discard the rest}@}.

    - The projected data points are {@{the rows of the _n_ × _l_ matrix __T__}@}, computed by {@{$$\mathbf{T} = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{W}$$}@}. Note that {@{the deviations from the mean instead of the original data points are used}@}. Using the latter is {@{also acceptable as a variant}@}.
