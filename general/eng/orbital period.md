### synodic period

One of the observable characteristics of two bodies which {@{[orbit](orbit.md) a third body in different orbits, and thus have different orbital periods}@}, is their {@{__synodic period__, which is the time between [conjunctions](conjunction%20(astronomy).md)}@}. It can also be defined for {@{a satellite of a body orbiting a third body}@}, in which case {@{the third body is used as the reference}@}. <!--SR:!2027-01-09,690,330!2028-06-12,1115,350!2027-09-17,877,330!2027-05-10,783,330-->

An example of this related period description is {@{the repeated cycles for [celestial bodies](astronomical%20object.md) as observed from the [Earth](Earth.md)'s surface}@}. The __synodic period__ applies to {@{the elapsed time where same kind of phenomenon happens or planets return to the same location}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-31,281,290!2026-02-06,387,290-->

If {@{the orbital periods of two bodies around a third}@} are {@{called _T<sub>1</sub>_ and _T<sub>2</sub>_, where _T<sub>1</sub>_ < _T<sub>2</sub>_}@}, their synodic period, if {@{both bodies are orbiting in the same direction}@}, is given by: {@{$$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} - \frac 1 {T_2}$$}@}. This also applies for {@{a satellite of a second body orbiting a third body, where the satellite orbits the same direction as the second body orbiting the third body}@}. _T<sub>1</sub>_ and _T<sub>2</sub>_ instead are orbital periods of {@{the satellite and the second body, subject to the same constraint _T<sub>1</sub>_ < _T<sub>2</sub>_}@}. If the orbiting directions are opposing (applies for both cases), the formula has {@{its minus sign replaced by a positive sign}@}: {@{$$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} + \frac 1 {T_2}$$}@}. Note that in this formula only, {@{_T<sub>1</sub>_ and _T<sub>2</sub>_ can be arbitrarily swapped, as addition is commutative}@}. <!--SR:!2028-10-09,1206,350!2028-09-14,1188,350!2027-10-20,933,350!2027-10-28,909,330!2026-09-14,557,310!2025-11-13,370,310!2027-03-20,750,330!2028-10-19,1215,350!2027-01-03,692,330-->
