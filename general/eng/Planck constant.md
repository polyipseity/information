# Planck constant

The __Planck constant__, or __Planck's constant__, denoted by {@{$h$}@}, is {@{a fundamental [physical constant](physical%20constant.md) of foundational importance in [quantum mechanics](quantum%20mechanics.md)}@}: {@{a [photon's energy](photon%20energy.md) is equal to its [frequency](frequency.md) multiplied by the Planck constant ($E = hf$), and the [wavelength](wavelength.md) of a [matter wave](matter%20mave.md) equals the Planck constant divided by the associated [particle](particle.md) [momentum](momentum.md) ($\lambda = h / p$)}@}.

When the Planck constant is expressed in {@{[SI units](International%20System%20of%20Units.md)}@}, it has {@{the exact value $$h = 6.626\,070\,15×10^{-34}\mathrm{\ J \cdot Hz^{−1} }$$}@}.
