# proton–proton chain

The __proton–proton chain__, also commonly referred to as the __p–p chain__, is {@{one of two known sets of [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) reactions by which [stars](star.md) convert [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) to [helium](helium.md)}@}. It dominates in {@{[stars](star.md) with [masses](mass.md) less than or equal to that of the [Sun](Sun.md)}@}, whereas the [CNO cycle](CNO%20cycle.md), the other known reaction, is suggested by theoretical models to {@{dominate in [stars](star.md) with [masses](mass.md) greater than about 1.3 [solar masses](solar%20mass.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-06-01,1382,350!2030-02-28,1555,330!2029-01-23,1146,310-->

## the proton–proton chain

(Note that elements in the chemical equations are {@{[ionized](ionization.md), so they are bare [nuclei](atomic%20nucleus.md)}@}.) <!--SR:!2029-07-12,1413,353-->

The first step in all the branches is {@{the fusion of two [protons](proton.md) ([hydrogen](hydrogen.md)) into a [deuteron](deuteron.md)}@}. As the protons fuse, {@{one of them undergoes [β+ decay](positron%20emission.md), converting into a [neutron](neutron.md) by emitting a [positron](positron.md) and an [electron neutrino](electron%20neutrino.md)}@} (though a small amount of deuterium nuclei is produced by the [PEP reaction](#the%20PEP%20reaction)): {@{$$\mathrm{p} + \mathrm{p} \to {}_1^2 \mathrm{D} + \mathrm{e}^+ + \nu_{\mathrm{e} } + 0.42\text{ MeV}$$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-16,479,315!2026-01-30,366,295!2027-07-31,701,275-->

- 1st step / energy release ::@:: 0.42 MeV <!--SR:!2025-12-21,336,290!2029-01-18,1202,310-->

{@{The [positron](positron.md)}@} will {@{[annihilate](annihilation.md) with an [electron](electron.md) from the environment into two [gamma rays](gamma%20ray.md)}@}. Including {@{this annihilation and the energy of the neutrino}@}, the net reaction {@{$$\mathrm{p} + \mathrm{p} + \mathrm{e}^- \to {}_1^2 \mathrm{D} + \nu_{\mathrm{e} } + 2\, \gamma + 1.442\text{ MeV }$$}@}, which is {@{the same as the [PEP reaction](#the%20PEP%20reaction)}@}. {@{The relative amounts of energy}@} going to {@{the neutrino and to the other products is variable}@}. <!--SR:!2029-11-06,1431,310!2026-06-21,314,230!2026-09-16,558,290!2025-12-26,17,316!2025-12-25,16,316!2025-12-25,16,316!2025-12-24,15,316-->

- 1st step + annihilation / energy release ::@:: 1.442 MeV <!--SR:!2028-06-03,996,295!2026-10-07,548,315-->

After it is formed, the [deuteron](deuteron.md) produced in the first stage can {@{fuse with another [proton](proton.md) to produce the stable, light [isotope](isotope.md) of [helium](helium.md), <sup>3</sup>He}@}: {@{$${}_1^2 \mathrm{D} + {}_1^1 \mathrm{H} \to {}_2^3 \mathrm{He} + \gamma + 5.493\text{ MeV}$$}@}. <!--SR:!2029-09-19,1372,315!2025-12-30,192,235-->

- 2nd step / energy release ::@:: 5.493 MeV <!--SR:!2026-02-16,213,170!2026-07-21,312,210-->

The overall reaction (noting that the elements are [ionized](ionization.md)) is: {@{$$4\, {}^1\mathrm{H}^+ + 2\,\mathrm{e}^- \to {}^4\mathrm{He}^{2+} + 2\,\nu_{\mathrm{e} } + n\, \gamma + 26.732\text{ MeV}$$, releasing 26.732&nbsp;[MeV](electronvolt.md) of [energy](energy.md)}@}. Some energy is {@{lost to the neutrinos, and various number of [gamma rays](gamma%20ray.md) depending on the branch taken}@}. <!--SR:!2027-04-13,696,290!2026-01-28,376,290-->

- overall reaction (including annihilation) / energy release ::@:: 26.732 MeV <!--SR:!2026-01-26,363,295!2028-02-16,979,335-->

### the p–p I branch

The p–p I branch is: {@{$${}_2^3\mathrm{He} + {}_2^3\mathrm{He} \to {}_2^4\mathrm{He} + 2\, {}_1^1\mathrm{H} + 12.859\text{ MeV}$$}@}. The complete chain releases {@{a net energy of 26.732 MeV}@} but {@{2.2 percent of this energy (0.59&nbsp;MeV) is lost to the [neutrinos](neutrino.md) that are produced}@}. The p–p I branch is dominant {@{at [temperatures](temperature.md) of 10 to 18&nbsp;MK. Below 10&nbsp;MK}@}, the p–p chain proceeds at slow rate, resulting in {@{a low production of <sup>4</sup>He}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-03,295,210!2027-01-30,592,250!2026-01-28,341,250!2027-03-02,574,290!2029-08-09,1366,310-->

- p–p I branch / energy release ::@:: 12.859 MeV <!--SR:!2026-06-26,294,175!2028-09-13,1052,315-->
