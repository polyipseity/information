# general journal

A __general journal__ is {@{a [daybook](bookkeeping.md#daybooks) or subsidiary journal in which transactions relating to adjustment entries, opening stock, depreciation, accounting errors etc. are recorded}@}. {@{The [source documents](source%20document.md) for general journal entries}@} may be {@{journal vouchers, copies of management reports and invoices}@}. Journals are {@{prime entry books, and may also be referred to as _books of original entry_, from when transactions were written in a journal}@} before they were {@{manually posted to accounts in the [general ledger](general%20ledger.md) or a subsidiary ledger}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-03,411,310!2025-10-12,299,330!2025-03-25,140,310!2025-05-13,174,310!2025-06-25,211,330-->

It is {@{where [double-entry bookkeeping](double-entry%20bookkeeping.md) entries are recorded by [debiting](debits%20and%20credits.md) one or more accounts and [crediting](debits%20and%20credits.md) another one or more accounts with the same total amount}@}. {@{The total amount debited and the total amount credited}@} should {@{always be equal, thereby ensuring the [accounting equation](accounting%20equation.md) is maintained}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-08-01,241,330!2025-07-10,224,330!2025-10-05,292,330-->

In {@{manual [accounting information systems](accounting%20information%20system.md)}@}, {@{a variety of [special journals](special%20journals.md)}@} may be used, such as {@{a [sales journal](sales%20journal.md), [purchase journal](purchase%20journal.md), [cash receipts journal](cash%20receipts%20journal.md), [disbursement journal](disbursement%20journal.md), and a general journal}@}. The transactions recorded in a general journal are {@{those that do not qualify for entry in any special journal used by the organisation, such as non-routine or [adjusting entries](adjusting%20entries.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-27,288,330!2025-10-26,309,330!2025-07-05,206,290!2025-07-06,187,270-->

## manual processing

{@{A bookkeeper or accountant}@} would {@{usually maintain the general journal}@}. A general journal entry is {@{a record of financial transactions in order by date}@}. A general journal entry would typically include {@{the date of the transaction (which may be dispensed with after the first entry of the day), the names of the accounts to be debited and credited (which should be the same as the name in the [chart of accounts](chart%20of%20accounts.md)), the amount of each debit and credit, and a summary explanation of the transaction, commonly known as a narration}@}. {@{Each debit and credit account and the narration}@} would {@{be entered on consecutive lines}@}, and typically {@{at least one line would be left blank before the next journal entry}@}, and {@{entries should not be split over more than one page}@}. Though not a requirement, it is {@{widespread practice to enter the debits first, followed by the credits and then the narration}@}. Whatever format is adopted, it should be {@{applied consistently}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-31,314,330!2025-07-23,234,330!2025-04-14,156,310!2025-08-08,210,270!2025-10-31,313,330!2025-08-25,261,330!2025-03-08,116,290!2025-07-09,208,310!2026-06-14,467,310!2025-07-19,231,330-->

There {@{may be multiple debit or credit entries}@}, but {@{the sum of the debits must be equal to the sum of the credits}@}. For example, {@{multiple expenses (debits) may be paid with one payment (a credit)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-12,225,330!2025-09-10,274,330!2025-04-05,149,310-->
