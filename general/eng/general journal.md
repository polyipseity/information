# general journal

A __general journal__ is {@{a [daybook](bookkeeping.md#daybooks) or subsidiary journal in which transactions relating to adjustment entries, opening stock, depreciation, accounting errors etc. are recorded}@}. {@{The [source documents](source%20document.md) for general journal entries}@} may be {@{journal vouchers, copies of management reports and invoices}@}. Journals are {@{prime entry books, and may also be referred to as _books of original entry_, from when transactions were written in a journal}@} before they were {@{manually posted to accounts in the [general ledger](general%20ledger.md) or a subsidiary ledger}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-03,411,310!2029-07-06,1363,350!2026-11-16,601,330!2027-06-02,746,330!2028-02-12,962,350-->

It is {@{where [double-entry bookkeeping](double-entry%20bookkeeping.md) entries are recorded by [debiting](debits%20and%20credits.md) one or more accounts and [crediting](debits%20and%20credits.md) another one or more accounts with the same total amount}@}. {@{The total amount debited and the total amount credited}@} should {@{always be equal, thereby ensuring the [accounting equation](accounting%20equation.md) is maintained}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-08-06,1101,350!2028-04-23,1016,350!2029-05-30,1333,350-->

In {@{manual [accounting information systems](accounting%20information%20system.md)}@}, {@{a variety of [special journals](special%20journals.md)}@} may be used, such as {@{a [sales journal](sales%20journal.md), [purchase journal](purchase%20journal.md), [cash receipts journal](cash%20receipts%20journal.md), [disbursement journal](disbursement%20journal.md), and a general journal}@}. The transactions recorded in a general journal are {@{those that do not qualify for entry in any special journal used by the organisation, such as non-routine or [adjusting entries](adjusting%20entries.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-05-02,1313,350!2029-09-01,1406,350!2027-10-17,834,310!2027-06-10,704,290-->

## manual processing

{@{A bookkeeper or accountant}@} would {@{usually maintain the general journal}@}. {@{A general journal entry}@} is {@{a record of financial transactions in order by date}@}. A general journal entry would typically include {@{the date of the transaction \(which may be dispensed with after the first entry of the day\)}@}, {@{the names of the accounts to be debited and credited (which should be the same as the name in the [chart of accounts](chart%20of%20accounts.md)), the amount of each debit and credit}@}, and {@{a summary explanation of the transaction, commonly known as a narration}@}. {@{Each debit and credit account and the narration}@} would {@{be entered on consecutive lines}@}, and typically {@{at least one line would be left blank before the next journal entry}@}, and {@{entries should not be split over more than one page}@}. Though not a requirement, it is {@{widespread practice}@} to {@{enter the debits first, followed by the credits and then the narration}@}. Whatever {@{format is adopted}@}, it should be {@{applied consistently}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-03,1433,350!2028-06-21,1064,350!2027-02-16,673,330!2027-03-03,571,270!2029-09-24,1424,350!2028-11-27,1190,350!2026-06-25,474,310!2027-12-21,892,330!2026-06-14,467,310!2028-06-08,1054,350!2027-02-27,451,390!2027-03-02,453,390!2027-03-01,453,390!2025-12-08,4,342!2025-12-08,4,342-->

There {@{may be multiple debit or credit entries}@}, but {@{the sum of the debits must be equal to the sum of the credits}@}. For example, {@{multiple expenses (debits) may be paid with one payment (a credit)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-05-01,1024,350!2029-02-07,1246,350!2027-01-05,640,330-->
