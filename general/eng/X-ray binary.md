# X-ray binary

__X-ray binaries__ are {@{a class of [binary stars](binary%20star.md) that are luminous in [X-rays](X-ray.md)}@}. The X-rays are {@{produced by matter falling from one component, called the _donor_ (usually a relatively common [main sequence](main%20sequence.md) [star](star.md)), to the other component, called the _accretor_, which is either a [neutron star](neutron%20star.md) or [black hole](black%20hole.md)}@}. The infalling matter {@{releases [gravitational potential energy](gravitational%20energy.md), up to 30 percent of its rest mass, as X-rays}@}. (Hydrogen [fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) releases {@{only about 0.7 percent of rest mass}@}.) The lifetime and the mass-transfer rate in an X-ray binary depends on {@{the evolutionary status of the donor star, the mass ratio between the stellar components, and their orbital separation}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-17,269,330!2025-04-15,167,270!2025-04-23,170,270!2025-01-19,124,310!2025-09-26,254,250-->
