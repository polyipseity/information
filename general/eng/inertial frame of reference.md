# inertial frame of reference

In {@{[classical physics](classical%20phyics.md) and [special relativity](special%20relativity.md)}@}, an __inertial frame of reference__ (also called __inertial space__, or __Galilean reference frame__) is {@{a [frame of reference](frame%20of%20reference.md) in which the laws of nature take on a particularly simple form}@}. <!--SR:!2028-12-14,1247,350!2027-07-22,825,330-->

All frames of reference with {@{zero [acceleration](acceleration.md) are in a state of constant [rectilinear motion](linear%20motion.md) (straight line motion) with respect to one another}@}. In such a frame, an object with {@{zero [net force](net%20force.md) acting on it}@} is {@{perceived to move with a constant [velocity](velocity.md), or, equivalently, [Newton's first law of motion](Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md#first%20law) holds}@}. Those are why {@{the frames are called _inertial_}@}. <!--SR:!2027-02-22,712,330!2025-08-09,298,330!2027-03-29,751,330!2028-04-24,1069,350-->
