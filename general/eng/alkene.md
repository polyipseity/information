# alkene

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../../tools/utility.py.md
```

An __alkene__ is {@{an [acyclic](open-chain%20compound.md) [unsaturated hydrocarbon](unsaturated%20hydrocarbon.md) containing [carbon](carbon.md)–carbon [double bonds](double%20bond.md)}@}.

## physical properties

Alkenes have similar [physical properties](physical%20property.md) to [alkanes](alkane.md). Some physical properties gradually change along the [homologous series](homologous%20series.md). Increasingly long alkene has {@{increasing [melting point](melting%20point.md), [boiling point](boiling%20point.md), [density](density.md), and [viscosity](viscosity.md)}@}.

## chemical properties

Alkenes are {@{stable but more [reactive](reactivity%20(chemistry).md) than [alkanes](alkane.md)}@}.

### combustion

- see: [alkane § combustion](alkane.md#combustion)

### hydrogenation

- see: [hydrogenation](hydrogenation.md)

Hydrogenation converts {@{alkenes into corresponding [alkanes](alkane.md) by adding [hydrogen](hydrogen.md)}@}. [Catalysts](catalysis.md) are almost always required and usually based on {@{[nickel](nickel.md), [palladium](palladium.md), and [platinum](platinum.md)}@}.

### hydrohalogenation

- see: [hydrohalogenation](hyydrohalogenation.md)

Hydrohalogenation converts {@{alkenes into [haloalkanes](haloalkane.md) by adding [hydrogen halides](hydrogen%20halide.md)}@}. If the alkene is asymmetric, {@{[Markovnikov's rule](Markovnikov's%20rule.md) states that the [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) or [electropositive](electronegativity.md) part preferentially attaches to the [carbon](carbon.md) [atom](atom.md) with more hydrogen substituents, while the [halide](halide.md) or electronegative part preferentially attaches to the carbon atom with more alkyl substituents}@}.

### polymerization

- see: [polymerization](polymerization.md)

### reactions

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects('d924', '9581'),
  (
    '[combustion](#combustion)',
    '[dihydroxylation](dihydroxylation.md)',

    '[hydrogenation](#hydrogenation)',
    '[hydrohalogenation](#hydrohalogenation)',

  ),
