# ionic bond

__Ionic bonding__ is {@{a type of [chemical bonding](chemical%20bond.md) involving the [electrostatic attraction](Coulomb's%20law.md) between oppositely charged [ions](ion.md) or [atoms](atom.md) with greatly differing [electronegativity](electronegativity.md)}@}. It is the primary interaction in {@{[ionic compounds](ionic%20compound.md)}@}. {@{A transfer of [electrons](electron.md)}@} takes place, which is also known as {@{__electrovalence__ in contrast to [covalence](covalent%20bond.md)}@}. Atoms that {@{gain electrons become [anions](ion.md) while those that lose electrons become [cations](ion.md)}@}.
