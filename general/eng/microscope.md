# microscope

A __microscope__ is {@{a [laboratory instrument](laboratory%20equipment.md) for examining objects too small to be seen by the [naked eye](naked%20eye.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2030-04-08,1965,350-->

## types

### optical microscope

- see: [optical microscope](optical%20microscope.md)

A optical microscope contains {@{one or more convex [lens](lens.md)}@}. The set of lens closer to the object is {@{the _objective_ while the remaining set is the _eyepiece_}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-22,774,310!2031-05-05,2269,350-->

### electron microscope

- see: [electron microscope](electron%20microscope.md)

The two main types of electron microscopes are {@{[transmission electron microscopes](transmission%20electron%20microscope.md) (TEMs) and [scanning electron microscopes](scanning%20electron%20microscope.md) (SEMs)}@}. They both have {@{electromagnetic and electrostatic lenses}@}. <!--SR:!2028-10-07,1423,330!2026-07-04,786,310-->

In {@{TEMs}@}, {@{high energy \(40 to 400 keV\) [electrons](electron.md)}@} pass through, {@{in order, condenser lens, a very thin \(less than 100 nm\) sample, objective lens}@}, {@{projector lens, and viewing screen}@}. {@{Drawbacks of TEMs}@} include {@{requiring a very thin sample and an ultra-high [vacuum](vacuum.md)}@} to {@{transmit electrons through and avoid deflection}@}, and {@{the sample}@} may be {@{damaged by fast-moving electrons}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-28,625,290!2026-01-08,280,170!2026-07-01,255,210!2026-02-02,85,350!2026-01-24,77,350!2026-02-02,85,350!2026-02-01,84,350!2026-01-27,80,350!2026-02-01,84,350-->

### scanning probe

- see: ::@:: [scanning probe microscopy](scanning%20probe%20microscopy.md) <!--SR:!2025-12-28,19,341!2025-12-28,19,341-->

There are {@{many types of scanning probe microscopes}@}. {@{The three main types}@} are {@{[atomic force microscopes](atomic%20force%20microscope.md) (AFMs)}@}, {@{[near-field scanning optical microscopes](near-field%20scanning%20optical%20microscope.md) (NSOMs or SNOMs, scanning near-field optical microscopes)}@}, and {@{[scanning tunneling microscopes](scanning%20tunneling%20microscope.md) (STMs)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-07-18,959,230!2025-12-28,19,341!2025-12-28,19,341!2025-12-22,13,321!2025-12-28,19,341-->

In {@{STMs}@}, {@{an extremely sharp [conducting](electrical%20conductor.md) tip}@} is {@{held extremely close to the sample}@}, which {@{must conduct [electric current](electric%20current.md)}@}. {@{A [bias](biasing.md) voltage}@} is applied {@{between the tip and the material}@} to allow {@{[electrons](electron.md) to [tunnel](quantum%20tunneling.md) through the [vacuum](vacuum.md) separating them}@}, creating {@{a _tunneling current_}@}. It has two modes: {@{_constant-height_ mode, requiring a flat surface to avoid crashing the tip}@}, and {@{_constant-current_ mode, requiring a much longer time to adjust the probe position}@}. It can also be used to {@{manipulate individual [atoms](atom.md) or [molecules](molecule.md)}@}. Advantages of STMs include {@{not requiring a [vacuum](vacuum.md) in principle}@} \(but {@{works better in a vacuum to avoid sample contamination}@}\), producing {@{easier to interpret results}@}, and being {@{simpler and cheaper}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-25,248,210!2026-10-06,814,270!2029-11-26,1861,350!2027-09-22,968,250!2026-11-09,324,349!2026-11-01,317,349!2026-11-06,321,349!2026-10-31,316,349!2026-11-02,318,349!2026-11-11,325,349!2026-11-03,319,349!2026-11-08,323,349!2026-11-07,322,349!2026-11-05,320,349!2026-10-30,315,349-->
