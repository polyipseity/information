# competitor analysis

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../tools/utility.py.md
```

## outline

This section {@{outlines how one might do competitor analysis and present it to others}@}.

### competitor classification

Depending on the 2 factors of {@{meeting the same customer needs and possessing the same capabilities to do so (such as having a similar product to solve the same problem)}@}, competitors can be classified into 4 types (we can {@{draw a 2 by 2 table}@} to represent it):

1. direct competitor ::@:: meeting the same customer needs and possessing the same capabilities to do so
2. indirect competitor ::@:: meeting the same customer needs but using different capabilities to do so
3. potential competitor ::@:: not meeting the same customer needs but possessing the same capabilities to do so
4. non-competitor ::@:: not meeting the same customer needs and not possessing the same capabilities to do so

Direct competitors are not {@{necessarily more important than indirect or potential competitors, and instead it depends on the market}@}.

> [!example] examples
>
> If I were [Starbucks](Starbucks.md), a [coffee shop](coffeehouse.md) company, then...
>
> - an direct competitor of Starbucks ::@:: [Dunkin' Donuts](Dunkin'%20Donuts.md): serves mainly coffee to satisfy beverage need
> - an indirect competitor of Starbucks ::@:: [bars](bar%20(establishment).md): does not serve coffee but [alcoholic beverages](alcoholic%20beverage.md) to satisfy beverage need
> - a potential competitor of Starbucks ::@:: [McDonald's](McDonald's.md): serves mainly coffee but usually as part of a meal to satisfy food need
> - a non-competitor of Starbucks ::@:: [Walmart](Walmart.md): does not serve coffee and does not satisfy beverage need

### considerations

# pytextgen generate data

  __env__.cwf_sects("b823", "48ff"),
  """
compare: Identify similarities and differences between our and their products.
copy: Identify advantages and capabilities our products lack compared to others.
discover: Identify unmet needs.
how: What is our strategy?
pricing: Compare prices.
who: Who are the competitors? 3 to 5 is usually enough.
why: Why are people using competitors' products?
""".strip().splitlines(),
)
```

### when to do

Competitor analysis can be done {@{anytime as needed}@}. For example, it can expose holes in existing products during {@{idea screening}@}, or determine suitable prices during {@{commercialization}@}.

### comparison parameters

Common parameters used for comparison, {@{most important first}@}:

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("9378", "a983"),
  """
price
benefit
quality
durability
service
convenience
ease of use
number of features
""".strip().splitlines(),
  pretext="most important", posttext="least important",
)
```

<!--pytextgen generate section="9378"--><!-- The following content is generated at 2024-05-03T13:49:10.593096+08:00. Any edits will be overridden! -->

> 1. price
> 2. benefit
> 3. quality
> 4. durability
> 5. service
> 6. convenience
> 7. ease of use
> 8. number of features

<!--/pytextgen-->

<!--pytextgen generate section="a983"--><!-- The following content is generated at 2024-06-04T14:02:33.625025+08:00. Any edits will be overridden! -->

- _(most important)_→::@::←price
- price→::@::←benefit
- benefit→::@::←quality
- quality→::@::←durability
- durability→::@::←service
- service→::@::←convenience
- convenience→::@::←ease of use
- ease of use→::@::←number of features
- number of features→::@::←_(least important)_

<!--/pytextgen-->

### visualization

It is very important to {@{add our own products to the visualization and make it obvious that the products are our own}@}.

If we are comparing two features only, we can {@{use a _xy_-grid and plot our and competitors' products}@}. If there are more features, {@{we can use a table, with the row headers being the features and the column headers being the products}@}. {@{A mix of both}@} is possible.

When listing the features, {@{use numbers}@} if possible. Do not be {@{vague}@}. Highlight {@{important features, such as the best product for each feature}@}.
