## outline

This section {@{outlines how one might do competitor analysis and present it to others}@}. <!--SR:!2028-12-01,1293,354-->

### competitor classification

Depending on the 2 factors of {@{meeting the same customer needs and possessing the same capabilities to do so (such as having a similar product to solve the same problem)}@}, competitors can be classified into 4 types (we can {@{draw a 2 by 2 table}@} to represent it): <!--SR:!2029-04-20,1408,361!2028-11-14,1287,361-->

1. direct competitor ::@:: meeting the same customer needs and possessing the same capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2027-01-04,672,321!2029-05-08,1426,361-->
2. indirect competitor ::@:: meeting the same customer needs but using different capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2028-01-31,974,301!2029-05-19,1436,361-->
3. potential competitor ::@:: not meeting the same customer needs but possessing the same capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2026-04-09,526,321!2028-12-30,1322,361-->
4. non-competitor ::@:: not meeting the same customer needs and not possessing the same capabilities to do so <!--SR:!2028-09-18,1244,361!2029-05-04,1422,361-->

Direct competitors are not {@{necessarily more important than indirect or potential competitors, and instead it depends on the market}@}. <!--SR:!2027-09-20,925,334-->

> [!example] examples
>
> If I were [Starbucks](Starbucks.md), a [coffee shop](coffeehouse.md) company, then...
>
> - an direct competitor of Starbucks ::@:: [Dunkin' Donuts](Dunkin'%20Donuts.md): serves mainly coffee to satisfy beverage need <!--SR:!2026-11-08,700,341!2029-03-10,1380,361-->
> - an indirect competitor of Starbucks ::@:: [bars](bar%20(establishment).md): does not serve coffee but [alcoholic beverages](alcoholic%20beverage.md) to satisfy beverage need <!--SR:!2026-12-25,689,301!2029-09-23,1535,361-->
> - a potential competitor of Starbucks ::@:: [McDonald's](McDonald's.md): serves mainly coffee but usually as part of a meal to satisfy food need <!--SR:!2028-02-03,1032,341!2030-01-31,1638,361-->
> - a non-competitor of Starbucks ::@:: [Walmart](Walmart.md): does not serve coffee and does not satisfy beverage need <!--SR:!2029-08-30,1516,361!2028-12-31,1323,361-->

### when to do

Competitor analysis can be done {@{anytime as needed}@}. For example, it can expose holes in existing products during {@{idea screening}@}, or determine suitable prices during {@{commercialization}@}. <!--SR:!2026-12-01,714,330!2028-07-03,1183,361!2028-06-13,1097,314-->

### visualization

It is very important to {@{add our own products to the visualization and make it obvious that the products are our own}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-20,510,321-->

If we are comparing two features only, we can {@{use a _xy_-grid and plot our and competitors' products}@}. If there are more features, {@{we can use a table, with the row headers being the features and the column headers being the products}@}. {@{A mix of both}@} is possible. <!--SR:!2029-03-06,1374,361!2028-04-16,1117,354!2026-09-16,659,330-->

When listing the features, {@{use numbers}@} if possible. Do not be {@{vague}@}. Highlight {@{important features, such as the best product for each feature}@}. <!--SR:!2027-09-22,940,341!2028-12-17,1309,361!2026-09-24,655,321-->
