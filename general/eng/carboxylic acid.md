# carboxylic acid

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../tools/utility.py.md
```

## physical properties

### boiling and melting points

Due to [hydrogen bonding](hydrogen%20bond.md) and {@{formation of [dimers](dimer%20(chemistry).md)}@}, carboxylic acids have {@{higher [boiling points](boiling%20point.md) and [melting points](melting%20point.md) than comparable [alcohols](alcohol.md)}@}. They also have {@{higher [boiling points](boiling%20point.md) than [water](water.md)}@}.

### density

Carboxylic acids are {@{less [dense](density.md) than [water](water.md) except for [formic acid](formic%20acid.md) and [acetic acid](acetic%20acid.md)}@}. Density {@{decreases}@} with increasing size.

### odor

Carboxylic acids have {@{a characteristic pungent smell and sour taste}@}.

### solubility

Carboxylic acids {@{that are small (1 to 4 carbons) are [miscible](miscibility.md) with [water](water.md) in all proportions}@}. Solubility {@{decreases}@} the larger the carboxylic acid.

## chemical properties

### dehydration

[Dehydration](dehydration%20reaction.md) can produce [amides](amide.md). Carboxylic acids {@{[neutralizes](neutralization%20(chemistry).md) [ammonia](ammonia.md) to give ammonium carboxylate, which can then be dehydrated by heat to give primary amides}@}.

#### esterification

In {@{[Fischer–Speier esterification](Fischer–Speier%20esterification.md)}@}, carboxylic acids {@{react with primary or secondary [alcohols](alcohol.md)}@} in the presence of {@{an [acid catalyst](acid%20catalyst) like concentrated [sulfuric acid](sulfuric%20acid.md)}@} to give [esters](ester.md) with {@{heating to speed up the reaction}@}. The reaction is {@{[reversible](reversible%20reaction.md)}@}.

### nucleophilic substitution

Similar to {@{[alcohols](alcohol.md)}@}, carboxylic acids can {@{react with [phosphorous trihalide](phosphorous%20trihalide.md) to give [acyl chlorides](acyl%20chloride.md)}@}, and {@{[phosphorous pentabromide](phosphorous%20pentabromide.md) to give acyl bromides}@}.

### reduction

Carboxylic acids {@{can be reduced to primary [alcohols](alcohol.md) directly using [lithium aluminium hydride](lithium%20aluminium%20hydride.md) in dry [diethyl ether](diethyl%20ether.md) and then add dilute [acid](acid.md)}@}.

### reactions
