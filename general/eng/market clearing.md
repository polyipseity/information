> In {@{[retail stores](retail%20format.md#retail%20types%20by%20marketing%20strategy)}@}, when {@{a business ends up with too much of a certain product, which remains unsold at its longstanding price (such as unsold summer clothing as the colder season approaches)}@}, the store will {@{typically discount the price until the excess stock is sold, a simple example of market clearing}@}. <!--SR:!2029-03-09,1228,350!2026-07-25,455,310!2025-11-29,294,330-->

In [economics](economics.md), __market clearing__ is {@{the process by which, in an [economic market](market%20(economics).md), the [supply](supply%20(economics).md) of whatever is traded is equated to the [demand](demand.md)}@} so that {@{there is no excess supply or demand, ensuring that there is neither a [surplus](excess%20supply.md) nor a [shortage](shortage.md)}@}. {@{The [new classical economics](new%20classical%20macroeconomics.md)}@} assumes that {@{in any given market, assuming that all buyers and sellers have access to information and that there is no "friction" impeding price changes}@}, {@{[prices](price.md) _constantly_ adjust up or down to ensure market clearing}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-05-16,918,330!2028-04-13,896,330!2029-01-12,1182,350!2027-03-07,644,330!2029-01-28,1195,350-->

## mechanism and examples

{@{A __market-clearing price__}@} is {@{the [price](price.md) of a good or service at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded}@}, also called {@{the [equilibrium price](economic%20equilibrium.md)}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> The theory claims that {@{markets tend to move toward this price}@}. Supply is {@{fixed for a one-time sale of goods}@}, so {@{the market-clearing price is simply the maximum price at which all items can be sold}@}. In {@{a market where goods are produced and sold on an ongoing basis}@}, the theory predicts that {@{the market will move toward a price where the quantity supplied in a broad period of time will equal the quantity demanded}@}. This might be measured over {@{a week, month, or year to smooth out irregularities caused by manufacturing batches and delivery schedules}@}; some sellers may {@{maintain inventory buffers to ensure that products are always available for retail sale and to smooth out irregularities caused by manufacturing and delivery schedules}@}, others employ {@{[just-in-time manufacturing](lean%20manufacturing.md)}@} to {@{increase profits in normal operations with the trade-off being greater disruption when irregularities do inevitably occur}@} \(eg. {@{drastic market fluctuations, natural disasters, pandemics, power outages, etc...}@}\). <!--SR:!2029-03-17,1233,350!2027-03-12,648,330!2025-11-21,287,330!2027-12-22,854,330!2029-01-13,1183,350!2025-11-24,290,330!2025-11-19,285,330!2027-04-08,665,330!2027-03-17,652,330!2027-09-27,799,330!2027-12-30,858,330!2027-03-21,587,310!2025-12-01,87,385-->

{@{The market clears}@} when {@{the price reaches a point where demand and supply are in equilibrium}@}, enabling individuals to {@{buy or sell whatever they desire at that cost}@}. When {@{supply and demand are equal}@}, {@{a market clearing takes place}@}. The market must {@{experience a [shortage](shortage.md) or a [surplus](surplus%20value.md) to reach this state}@}. A shortage indicates that {@{buyers are interested in purchasing something, but need help to afford to do so at current prices}@}. Conversely, {@{a surplus occurs}@} when there is {@{an excess product beyond the quantity that buyers are willing to purchase at current prices}@}. {@{[New classical economics](new%20classical%20macroeconomics.md)}@} does not {@{assume perfect information in the short run}@}, but {@{markets may approach efficient outcomes as information is discovered}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-03-24,1240,350!2029-04-07,1251,350!2029-02-18,1213,350!2029-03-13,1230,350!2029-04-28,1265,350!2029-03-15,1233,350!2028-01-16,871,330!2026-03-25,141,310!2025-11-22,288,330!2027-12-16,849,330!2025-11-27,292,330-->

If {@{the sale price exceeds the market-clearing price}@}, {@{supply will exceed demand, and a surplus inventory will build up over the [long run](long%20run%20and%20short%20run.md)}@}. If {@{the sale price is lower than the market-clearing price}@}, then {@{demand will exceed supply, and in the long run, shortages will result, where buyers sometimes find no products for sale at any price}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-13,280,330!2029-02-21,1214,350!2028-01-26,880,330!2025-11-23,289,330-->

{@{The market-clearing theory}@} states that {@{prices in a free market tend towards equilibrium}@}, where {@{the quantity of goods or services supplied equals the quantity demanded}@}. The theory assumes that {@{prices adjust quickly to any changes in supply or demand}@}, meaning that {@{markets can reach equilibrium instantaneously}@}. For example, consider a scenario where {@{a community experiences an earthquake that destroys all houses and apartments}@}. {@{The sudden demand for new housing}@} will {@{create a temporary shortage of houses and apartments in the market}@}. However, if {@{prices are free to change}@}, {@{construction companies}@} will {@{build new houses in the short run}@}, while {@{new companies}@} will {@{enter the house and apartment construction market in the longer run}@}. As a result, {@{the housing supply will increase}@}, eventually reaching {@{a point where it equals the new demand}@}. This adjustment mechanism {@{clears the shortage from the market}@}, establishing {@{a new equilibrium where the market is in balance}@}. This adjustment process is {@{critical in ensuring that markets operate efficiently, promoting economic growth and stability}@}. This increase in production brings {@{supply into harmony with the new demand}@}. The adjustment mechanism has {@{cleared the shortage from the market and established a new equilibrium}@}. {@{A similar mechanism}@} is believed to operate when {@{there is a market surplus \(glut\)}@}, where prices {@{fall until all the excess supply is sold}@}. An example of excess supply is {@{[Christmas decorations](Christmas%20decoration.md) that are still in stores several days after Christmas}@}; {@{the stores that still have boxes of decorations}@} view {@{these products as excess supply}@}, so {@{prices are discounted}@} until shoppers {@{buy all the decorations \(to keep them until next Christmas\)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,281,330!2025-11-22,288,330!2029-01-19,1188,350!2029-01-17,1186,350!2027-11-19,829,330!2028-01-05,863,330!2025-11-29,294,330!2027-03-22,656,330!2025-11-12,279,330!2026-03-12,136,310!2025-11-21,287,330!2025-11-28,293,330!2029-02-04,1201,350!2028-04-30,908,330!2027-11-22,831,330!2029-02-23,1217,350!2026-06-11,420,310!2026-04-05,341,290!2026-06-30,437,310!2025-11-13,281,330!2025-11-26,23,372!2025-11-26,23,372!2025-11-17,14,352-->

## history and non-ideal behavior

For {@{150 years (from approximately 1785 to 1935)}@}, most economists took {@{the smooth operation of this market-clearing mechanism as inevitable and inviolable}@}, based mainly on {@{belief in [Say's law](Say's%20law.md)}@}. But {@{the [Great Depression](Great%20Depression.md) of the 1930s}@} caused {@{many economists, including [John Maynard Keynes](John%20Maynard%20Keynes.md), to doubt their classical faith}@}. If {@{markets were supposed to clear}@}, how could {@{ruinously high [unemployment](unemployment.md) rates persist for so many painful years}@}? Was the market mechanism {@{not supposed to eliminate such surpluses}@}? In [one interpretation](New%20Keynesian%20economics.md), Keynes identified {@{imperfections in the adjustment mechanism that, if present, could introduce rigidities and make prices [sticky](nominal%20rigidity.md)}@}. In [another interpretation](Keynesian%20economics.md#wages%20and%20spending), price adjustment could {@{worsen matters, causing what [Irving Fisher](Irving%20Fisher.md) called "[debt deflation](debt%20deflation.md)"}@}. {@{Not all economists}@} accept these theories. They attribute {@{what appears to be imperfect clearing}@} to {@{factors like labor unions or government policy, thereby exonerating the clearing mechanism}@}. <!--SR:!2027-11-24,801,290!2025-11-19,285,330!2029-03-30,1245,350!2025-11-27,292,330!2026-02-17,330,290!2025-11-28,293,330!2029-03-28,1242,350!2029-01-31,1198,350!2027-11-13,835,330!2026-07-17,450,310!2027-12-06,842,330!2029-04-15,1257,350!2025-11-28,293,330-->

Most economists see {@{the assumption of _continuous_ market clearing as unrealistic}@}. However, many see {@{the concept of flexible prices as useful in the long-run analysis}@} since {@{prices are not stuck forever}@}: market-clearing models describe {@{the equilibrium economy gravitates towards}@}. Therefore, {@{many macro-economists}@} feel that {@{price flexibility is a reasonable assumption for studying long-run issues}@}, such as {@{[growth](economic%20growth.md) in [real](real%20and%20nominal%20value.md) [GDP](gross%20domestic%20product.md)}@}. Other economists argue that {@{price adjustment may take so much time}@} that {@{the process of calibration may change the underlying conditions that determine long-run equilibrium}@}. There may be {@{[path dependence](path%20dependence.md)}@}, as when {@{a long depression changes the nature of the "[full employment](full%20employment.md)" period that follows}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,285,330!2029-04-21,1263,350!2029-04-26,1264,350!2025-11-26,291,330!2025-11-20,286,330!2027-11-09,820,330!2025-11-26,291,330!2025-11-12,280,330!2026-01-05,304,290!2028-03-05,867,330!2026-06-20,428,310-->

In {@{the short run (and possibly in the long run)}@}, markets may {@{find a temporary equilibrium at a price and quantity that does not correspond with the long-term market-clearing balance}@}. For example, in {@{the theory of "[efficiency wages](efficiency%20wage.md)"}@}, a labor market can be {@{in equilibrium above the market-clearing wage}@} since {@{each employer has the incentive to pay wages above market-clearing to motivate their employees}@}. In this case, {@{equilibrium wages (where there is no [endogenous](endogeneity%20(econometrics).md) tendency for wages to change)}@} would not be {@{the same as market-clearing wages (where there is no [classical unemployment](unemployment.md#real%20wage%20unemployment))}@}. <!--SR:!2029-02-11,1207,350!2027-03-18,655,330!2025-11-20,286,330!2025-11-27,292,330!2027-12-12,847,330!2029-03-12,1229,350!2026-11-12,531,310-->

## flexibility in market clearing

In {@{an unregulated and perfect market}@} {@{both labor market wages and product market prices}@} are {@{fully flexible and can change rapidly based on supply and demand}@}. This flexibility ensures that {@{neither the product nor the labor markets will experience an oversupply}@}. If {@{there is an oversupply of a product}@}, its price will {@{drop until buyers find it affordable}@}, and in {@{the case of a labor surplus}@}, {@{wages will decrease until employers can offer jobs to all willing workers}@}. This mechanism ensures that {@{every market tends towards equilibrium where supply meets demand}@}. For instance, retailers may {@{offer discounts on old cell phones and computers}@} to {@{sell them quickly and balance their inventory}@}. The flexible pricing allows {@{more people to buy these items, achieving market equilibrium}@}. <!--SR:!2029-02-24,1218,350!2026-04-05,340,290!2025-11-29,294,330!2027-04-12,669,330!2029-05-08,1274,350!2029-02-11,1206,350!2029-03-05,1226,350!2025-11-12,280,330!2029-01-24,1192,350!2027-09-08,783,330!2029-04-30,1266,350!2025-11-13,281,330-->
