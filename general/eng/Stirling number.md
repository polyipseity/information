# Stirling number

In [mathematics](mathematics.md), __Stirling numbers__ {@{arise in a variety of [analytic](mathematical%20analysis.md) and [combinatorial](combinatorics.md) problems}@}. They are named after {@{[James Stirling](James%20Stirling%20(mathematician).md)}@}, who {@{introduced them in a purely algebraic setting in his book _Methodus differentialis_ (1730)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> They were {@{rediscovered and given a combinatorial meaning by Masanobu Saka in 1782}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-08-13,1363,350!2027-11-19,854,330!2027-03-09,659,330!2026-02-07,312,290-->

{@{Two different sets of numbers}@} bear this name: {@{the [Stirling numbers of the first kind](Stirling%20numbers%20of%20the%20first%20kind.md) and the [Stirling numbers of the second kind](Stirling%20numbers%20of%20the%20second%20kind.md)}@}. Additionally, {@{[Lah numbers](Lah%20number.md)}@} are {@{sometimes referred to as Stirling numbers of the third kind}@}. Each kind is detailed in {@{its respective article, this one serving as a description of relations between them}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-09,315,330!2029-08-07,1358,350!2029-07-14,1339,350!2029-04-06,1259,350!2028-03-09,923,330-->

A common property of all three kinds is that {@{they describe coefficients relating three different sequences of polynomials that frequently arise in combinatorics}@}. Moreover, all three can be {@{defined as the number of partitions of _n_ elements into _k_ non-empty subsets}@}, where {@{each subset is endowed with a certain kind of order (no order, cyclical, or linear)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-12-27,867,330!2029-04-03,1256,350!2028-04-11,949,330-->

## notation

- see: [Stirling numbers of the first kind](Stirling%20numbers%20of%20the%20first%20kind.md) and [Stirling numbers of the second kind](Stirling%20numbers%20of%20the%20second%20kind.md)

{@{Several different notations for Stirling numbers}@} are in use. {@{Ordinary (signed) __Stirling numbers of the first kind__}@} are commonly denoted: {@{$$s(n,k)\,.$$}@} <!--SR:!2027-12-22,879,330!2025-11-27,305,330!2025-12-08,314,330-->

{@{__Unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind__}@}, which count {@{the number of [permutations](permutation.md) of _n_ elements with _k_ disjoint [cycles](cyclic%20permutation.md)}@}, are denoted: {@{$${\biggl [}{n \atop k}{\biggr ]}=c(n,k)=|s(n,k)|=(-1)^{n-k}s(n,k)\,$$}@} <!--SR:!2025-11-23,302,330!2028-05-06,969,330!2028-02-04,898,330-->

{@{__Stirling numbers of the second kind__}@}, which count {@{the number of ways to partition a set of _n_ elements into _k_ nonempty subsets}@}:<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> {@{$${\biggl \{}{\!n\! \atop \!k\!}{\biggr \} }=S(n,k)=S_{n}^{(k)}\,$$}@} <!--SR:!2029-07-30,1351,350!2029-04-04,1257,350!2025-12-03,310,330-->

[Abramowitz and Stegun](Abramowitz%20and%20Stegun.md) use {@{an uppercase $S$ and a [blackletter](blackletter.md) ${\mathfrak {S} }$, respectively}@}, for {@{the first and second kinds of Stirling number}@}. {@{The notation of brackets and braces, in analogy to [binomial coefficients](binomial%20coefficient.md)}@}, was {@{introduced in 1935 by [Jovan Karamata](Jovan%20Karamata.md) and promoted later by [Donald Knuth](Donald%20Knuth.md)}@}, though {@{the bracket notation conflicts with a common notation for [Gaussian coefficients](Gaussian%20binomial%20coefficient.md)}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> The mathematical motivation for this type of notation, as well as additional Stirling number formulae, may be found on the page for [Stirling numbers and exponential generating functions](Stirling%20numbers%20and%20exponential%20generating%20functions%20in%20symbolic%20combinatorics.md). <!--SR:!2028-03-14,927,330!2025-11-24,303,330!2027-01-11,591,310!2027-11-04,784,290!2025-12-04,311,330-->

{@{Another infrequent notation}@} is {@{$s_{1}(n,k)$ and $s_{2}(n,k)$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-09,315,330!2025-11-24,303,330-->

## expansions of falling and rising factorials

Stirling numbers express {@{coefficients in expansions of [falling and rising factorials](falling%20and%20rising%20factorials.md) (also known as the Pochhammer symbol) as polynomials}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-28,306,330-->

That is, {@{the __falling factorial__, defined as $\ (x)_{n}=x(x-1)\ \cdots (x-n+1)\ ,$}@} is {@{a polynomial in _x_ of degree _n_ whose expansion is $$(x)_{n}\ =\ \sum _{k=0}^{n}\ s(n,k)\ x^{k}{\ }$$}@} with {@{(signed) Stirling numbers of the first kind as coefficients}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-02,309,330!2027-03-15,548,270!2026-01-23,308,290-->

Note that {@{$\ (x)_{0}\equiv 1\ ,$ by convention}@}, because {@{it is an [empty product](empty%20product.md)}@}. {@{The notations $\ x^{\underline {n} }{\ }$ for the falling factorial and $\ x^{\overline {n} }{\ }$ for the rising factorial}@} are also often used.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> (Confusingly, {@{the Pochhammer symbol that many use for _falling_ factorials}@} is {@{used in [special functions](special%20functions.md) for _rising_ factorials}@}.) <!--SR:!2029-07-02,1329,350!2029-04-10,1262,350!2029-04-07,1260,350!2025-11-23,302,330!2025-12-04,311,330-->

Similarly, {@{the __rising factorial__, defined as $\ x^{(n)}\ =\ x(x+1)\ \cdots (x+n-1)\ ,$}@} is {@{a polynomial in _x_ of degree _n_ whose expansion is $$x^{(n)}\ =\ \sum _{k=0}^{n}\ {\biggl [}{n \atop k}{\biggr ]}\ x^{k}\ =\ \sum _{k=0}^{n}\ (-1)^{n-k}\ s(n,k)\ x^{k}\ ,$$}@} with {@{unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind as coefficients}@}. One of these expansions can be {@{derived from the other}@} by {@{observing that $\ x^{(n)}=(-1)^{n}(-x)_{n}~.$}@} <!--SR:!2029-08-11,1361,350!2027-05-14,635,310!2028-02-27,914,330!2025-12-10,316,330!2028-04-27,914,330-->

{@{Stirling numbers of the second kind}@} express {@{the reverse relations}@}: {@{$$\ x^{n}\ =\ \sum _{k=0}^{n}\ S(n,k)\ (x)_{k}{\ }$$ and $$\ x^{n}\ =\ \sum _{k=0}^{n}\ (-1)^{n-k}\ S(n,k)\ x^{(k)}~.$$}@} <!--SR:!2027-04-01,619,310!2027-11-07,841,330!2026-02-10,313,290-->

## as change of basis coefficients

Considering {@{the set of [polynomials](polynomial.md) in the (indeterminate) variable _x_ as a vector space}@}, {@{each of the three sequences $$x^{0},x^{1},x^{2},x^{3},\dots \quad (x)_{0},(x)_{1},(x)_{2},\dots \quad x^{(0)},x^{(1)},x^{(2)},\dots$$}@} is {@{a [basis](basis%20(linear%20algebra).md)}@}. That is, {@{every polynomial in _x_}@} can be written as {@{a sum $a_{0}x^{(0)}+a_{1}x^{(1)}+\dots +a_{n}x^{(n)}$ for some unique coefficients $a_{i}$}@} \(similarly for {@{the other two bases}@}\). The above relations then {@{express the [change of basis](change%20of%20basis.md) between them, as summarized in the following [commutative diagram](commutative%20diagram.md)}@}: <p> {@{![commutative diagram of Stirling numbers as changes of basis](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Stirling%20numbers%20as%20polynomial%20basis%20changes.png)}@} <p> {@{The coefficients for the two bottom changes}@} are {@{described by the [Lah numbers](#Lah%20numbers) below}@}. Since {@{coefficients in any basis are unique}@}, one can {@{define Stirling numbers this way, as the coefficients expressing polynomials of one basis in terms of another}@}, that is, {@{the unique numbers relating $x^{n}$ with falling and rising factorials as above}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-29,307,330!2029-04-05,1258,350!2029-08-10,1361,350!2028-05-15,927,330!2025-12-05,312,330!2028-06-27,951,290!2029-07-29,1350,350!2028-02-09,901,330!2029-05-29,1301,350!2027-05-20,640,310!2025-11-26,304,330!2026-01-20,64,354!2025-11-20,17,354-->

Falling factorials define, {@{up to scaling, the same polynomials as [binomial coefficients](binomial%20coefficient.md#binomial%20coefficients%20as%20polynomials)}@}: {@{${\binom {x}{k} }=(x)_{k}/k!$}@}. {@{The changes between the standard basis $\textstyle x^{0},x^{1},x^{2},\dots$ and the basis ${\binom {x}{0} },{\binom {x}{1} },{\binom {x}{2} },\dots$}@} are {@{thus described by similar formulas: $$x^{n}=\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\biggl \{}{\!n\! \atop \!k\!}{\biggr \} }k!{\binom {x}{k} }\quad {\text{and} }\quad {\binom {x}{n} }=\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\frac {s(n,k)}{n!} }x^{k} \,.$$}@} <!--SR:!2025-11-23,302,330!2029-07-03,1329,350!2026-01-30,313,290!2026-06-06,355,250-->

### example

{@{Expressing a polynomial in the basis of falling factorials}@} is {@{useful for calculating sums of the polynomial evaluated at consecutive integers}@}. Indeed, {@{the sum of falling factorials up to _n_ (exclusive) with fixed _k_}@} can expressed as {@{another falling factorial (for $k\neq -1$) $$\sum _{0\leq i<n}(i)_{k}={\frac {(n)_{k+1} }{k+1} }$$}@} (annotation: The above {@{suspiciously looks like definite integration of _i<sup>k</sup>_ from 0 to _n_... but with discrete summation}@}.) This can be proved by {@{[induction](mathematical%20induction.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-27,304,330!2029-07-11,1337,350!2025-12-07,313,330!2026-07-22,418,290!2027-07-27,688,310!2027-11-20,854,330-->

For example, {@{the sum of fourth powers of integers up to _n_ (this time with _n_ included)}@}, is: {@{$${\begin{aligned}\sum _{i=0}^{n}i^{4}&=\sum _{i=0}^{n}\sum _{k=0}^{4}{\biggl \{}{\!4\! \atop \!k\!}{\biggr \} }(i)_{k}=\sum _{k=0}^{4}{\biggl \{}{\!4\! \atop \!k\!}{\biggr \} }\sum _{i=0}^{n}(i)_{k}=\sum _{k=0}^{4}{\biggl \{}{\!4\! \atop \!k\!}{\biggr \} }{\frac {(n{+}1)_{k+1} }{k{+}1} }\\[10mu]&={\biggl \{}{\!4\! \atop \!1\!}{\biggr \} }{\frac {(n{+}1)_{2} }{2} }+{\biggl \{}{\!4\! \atop \!2\!}{\biggr \} }{\frac {(n{+}1)_{3} }{3} }+{\biggl \{}{\!4\! \atop \!3\!}{\biggr \} }{\frac {(n{+}1)_{4} }{4} }+{\biggl \{}{\!4\! \atop \!4\!}{\biggr \} }{\frac {(n{+}1)_{5} }{5} }\\[8mu]&={\frac {1}{2} }(n{+}1)_{2}+{\frac {7}{3} }(n{+}1)_{3}+{\frac {6}{4} }(n{+}1)_{4}+{\frac {1}{5} }(n{+}1)_{5}\,.\end{aligned} }$$}@} Here the Stirling numbers can be computed from {@{their definition as the number of partitions of 4 elements into _k_ non-empty unlabeled subsets}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-03,310,330!2026-06-25,369,250!2026-04-11,394,310-->

In contrast, {@{the sum $\sum _{i=0}^{n}i^{k}$ in the standard basis}@} is {@{given by [Faulhaber's formula](Faulhaber's%20formula.md), which in general is more complicated}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-01,308,330!2025-12-08,314,330-->

## as inverse matrices

{@{The Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds}@} can be considered {@{inverses of one another}@}: {@{$$\sum _{j=k}^{n}s(n,j)S(j,k)=\sum _{j=k}^{n}(-1)^{n-j}{\biggl [}{n \atop j}{\biggr ]}{\biggl \{}{\!j\! \atop \!k\!}{\biggr \} }=\delta _{n,k}$$ and $$\sum _{j=k}^{n}S(n,j)s(j,k)=\sum _{j=k}^{n}(-1)^{j-k}{\biggl \{}{\!n\! \atop \!j\!}{\biggr \} }{\biggl [}{j \atop k}{\biggr ]}=\delta _{n,k},$$}@} where {@{$\delta _{nk}$ is the [Kronecker delta](kronecker%20delta.md)}@}. These two relationships may be understood to be {@{matrix inverse relationships}@}. That is, let {@{_s_ be the [lower triangular matrix](triangular%20matrix.md) of (signed) Stirling numbers of the first kind}@}, whose {@{matrix elements $s_{nk}=s(n,k).\,$}@} {@{The [inverse](invertible%20matrix.md) of this matrix}@} is {@{_S_, the [lower triangular matrix](triangular%20matrix.md) of (unsigned) Stirling numbers of the second kind}@}, whose entries are {@{$S_{nk}=S(n,k).$}@} Symbolically, this is written {@{$$s^{-1}=S\,.$$}@} Although {@{_s_ and _S_ are infinite}@}, so calculating {@{a product entry involves an infinite sum}@}, {@{the matrix multiplications work}@} because these matrices are {@{lower triangular, so only a finite number of terms in the sum are nonzero}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-24,303,330!2025-11-24,303,330!2026-12-19,572,310!2025-11-28,305,330!2029-04-14,1265,350!2026-02-11,313,290!2025-12-04,311,330!2028-04-23,911,330!2025-12-01,308,330!2025-12-07,313,330!2029-08-01,1354,350!2026-02-06,85,373!2026-02-04,83,373!2026-02-02,81,373!2026-02-03,82,373-->

## Lah numbers

- see: [Lah numbers](Lah%20number.md)

{@{The Lah numbers $L(n,k)={n-1 \choose k-1}{\frac {n!}{k!} }$}@} are {@{sometimes called Stirling numbers of the third kind}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> By convention, {@{$L(0,0)=1$ and $L(n,k)=0$ if $n<k$ or $k=0<n$}@}. <!--SR:!2029-07-19,1342,350!2025-11-27,305,330!2025-12-02,309,330-->

These numbers are {@{coefficients expressing falling factorials in terms of rising factorials and vice versa}@}: {@{<p> $x^{(n)}=\sum _{k=0}^{n}L(n,k)(x)_{k}\quad$ and $\quad (x)_{n}=\sum _{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{n-k}L(n,k)x^{(k)}.$}@} <!--SR:!2029-04-26,1274,350!2025-12-10,316,330-->

As above, this means they {@{express the change of basis between the bases $(x)_{0},(x)_{1},(x)_{2},\cdots$ and $x^{(0)},x^{(1)},x^{(2)},\cdots$, completing the diagram}@}. In particular, {@{one formula is the inverse of the other}@}, thus: {@{$$\sum _{j=k}^{n}(-1)^{j-k}L(n,j)L(j,k)=\delta _{n,k}.$$}@} <!--SR:!2025-12-02,309,330!2029-07-13,1338,350!2025-11-23,302,330-->

Similarly, {@{composing the change of basis from $x^{(n)}$ to $x^{n}$ with the change of basis from $x^{n}$ to $(x)_{n}$}@} gives {@{the change of basis directly from $x^{(n)}$ to $(x)_{n}$}@}: {@{$$L(n,k)=\sum _{j=k}^{n}{\biggl [}{n \atop j}{\biggr ]}{\biggl \{}{\!j\! \atop \!k\!}{\biggr \} },$$}@} and similarly for other compositions. In {@{terms of matrices}@}, if {@{$L$ denotes the matrix with entries $L_{nk}=L(n,k)$ and $L^{-}$ denotes the matrix with entries $L_{nk}^{-}=(-1)^{n-k}L(n,k)$}@}, then {@{one is the inverse of the other: $L^{-}=L^{-1}$}@}. Composing {@{the matrix of unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind with the matrix of Stirling numbers of the second kind}@} gives {@{the Lah numbers: $L=|s|\cdot S$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-05,312,330!2028-04-12,949,330!2026-02-08,312,290!2025-11-29,307,330!2028-03-18,930,330!2025-12-09,315,330!2028-02-03,898,330!2026-01-08,340,346-->

[Enumeratively](enumerative%20combinatorics.md), $\left\{ {\!n\! \atop \!k\!}\right\},\left[{n \atop k}\right],L(n,k)$ can be defined as {@{the number of partitions of _n_ elements into _k_ non-empty unlabeled subsets, where each subset is endowed with no order, a [cyclic order](cyclic%20order.md), or a linear order, respectively}@}. In particular, this {@{implies the inequalities: $${\biggl \{}{\!n\! \atop \!k\!}{\biggr \} }\leq {\biggl [}{n \atop k}{\biggr ]}\leq L(n,k).$$}@} <!--SR:!2027-12-01,859,330!2025-12-03,310,330-->

## Stirling numbers with negative integral values

The Stirling numbers can be {@{extended to negative integral values, but not all authors do so in the same way}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup><sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup><sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> Regardless of {@{the approach taken}@}, it is worth noting that {@{Stirling numbers of first and second kind are connected by the relations}@}: {@{$${\biggl [}{n \atop k}{\biggr ]}={\biggl \{}{\!-k\! \atop \!-n\!}{\biggr \} }\quad {\text{and} }\quad {\biggl \{}{\!n\! \atop \!k\!}{\biggr \} }={\biggl [}{-k \atop -n}{\biggr ]}$$}@} when {@{_n_ and _k_ are nonnegative integers}@}. So we have the following table for $\left[{-n \atop -k}\right]$: <!--SR:!2025-12-05,312,330!2025-12-08,314,330!2029-04-09,1261,350!2028-06-10,947,330!2025-11-28,306,330-->

| _n_\\_k_ | __−1__ | __−2__ | __−3__ | __−4__ | __−5__ |

Donald Knuth<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> defined the more general Stirling numbers by {@{extending a [recurrence relation](Stirling%20numbers%20of%20the%20second%20kind.md#recurrence%20relation) to all integers}@}. In this approach, $\left[{n \atop k}\right]$ and $\left\{ {\!n\! \atop \!k\!}\right\}$ are {@{zero if _n_ is negative and _k_ is nonnegative, or if _n_ is nonnegative and _k_ is negative}@}, and so we have, for {@{_any_ integers _n_ and _k_}@}, {@{$${\biggl [}{n \atop k}{\biggr ]}={\biggl \{}{\!-k\! \atop \!-n\!}{\biggr \} }\quad {\text{and} }\quad {\biggl \{}{\!n\! \atop \!k\!}{\biggr \} }={\biggl [}{-k \atop -n}{\biggr ]}.$$}@} <!--SR:!2029-06-27,1324,350!2025-11-23,302,330!2025-12-06,312,330!2028-05-12,974,330-->

On the other hand, for {@{positive integers _n_ and _k_}@}, David Branson<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> defined {@{$\left[{-n \atop -k}\right]\!,$ $\left\{ {\!-n\! \atop \!-k\!}\right\}\!,$ $\left[{-n \atop k}\right]\!,$ and $\left\{ {\!-n\! \atop \!k\!}\right\}$ (but not $\left[{n \atop -k}\right]$ or $\left\{ {\!n\! \atop \!-k\!}\right\}$)}@}. In this approach, one has {@{the following extension of the [recurrence relation](Stirling%20numbers%20of%20the%20second%20kind.md#recurrence%20relation) of the Stirling numbers of the first kind}@}: $${\biggl [}{-n \atop k}{\biggr ]}={\frac {(-1)^{n+1} }{n!} }\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {(-1)^{i+1} }{i^{k} } }{\binom {n}{i} } \,.$$ <!--SR:!2028-01-29,894,330!2026-03-02,354,290!2027-07-15,679,310-->

For example, $\left[{-5 \atop k}\right]={\frac {1}{120} }{\Bigl (}5-{\frac {10}{2^{k} } }+{\frac {10}{3^{k} } }-{\frac {5}{4^{k} } }+{\frac {1}{5^{k} } }{\Bigr )}.$ This leads to the following table of values of $\left[{n \atop k}\right]$ for negative integral _n_.

| _k_\\_n_ | __0__                  | __1__                     | __2__                         | __3__                            | __4__                                |
|:--------:|:----------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|
| __−1__   | 1                      | 1                         | 1                             | 1                                | 1                                    |
| __−2__   | $${\tfrac {-1}{2} }$$  | $${\tfrac {-3}{4} }$$     | $${\tfrac {-7}{8} }$$         | $${\tfrac {-15}{16} }$$          | $${\tfrac {-31}{32} }$$              |
| __−3__   | $${\tfrac {1}{6} }$$   | $${\tfrac {11}{36} }$$    | $${\tfrac {85}{216} }$$       | $${\tfrac {575}{1296} }$$        | $${\tfrac {3661}{7776} }$$           |
| __−4__   | $${\tfrac {-1}{24} }$$ | $${\tfrac {-25}{288} }$$  | $${\tfrac {-415}{3456} }$$    | $${\tfrac {-5845}{41472} }$$     | $${\tfrac {-76111}{497664} }$$       |
| __−5__   | $${\tfrac {1}{120} }$$ | $${\tfrac {137}{7200} }$$ | $${\tfrac {12019}{432000} }$$ | $${\tfrac {874853}{25920000} }$$ | $${\tfrac {58067611}{1555200000} }$$ |

In this case {@{$\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\left[{-n \atop -k}\right]=B_{k}$}@} where {@{$B_{k}$ is a [Bell number](Bell%20number.md)}@}, and so one may {@{define the negative Bell numbers by $\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\left[{-n \atop k}\right]=:B_{-k}$}@}. <!--SR:!2027-01-27,485,270!2025-12-05,312,330!2026-06-18,395,290-->

For example, this produces $\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\left[{-n \atop 1}\right]=B_{-1}={\frac {1}{e} }\sum _{j=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{j\cdot j!} }={\frac {1}{e} }\int _{0}^{1}{\frac {e^{t}-1}{t} }dt=0.4848291\dots$, generally $B_{-k}={\frac {1}{e} }\sum _{j=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{j^{k}j!} }$.
