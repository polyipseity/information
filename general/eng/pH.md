# pH

__pH__ is {@{a scale of the [acidity](acid.md) or [basicity](base%20(chemistry).md) of an [aqueous solution](aqueous%20solution.md)}@}. Lower pH means {@{acidic, and high pH means basic or [alkaline](alkali.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,801,330!2025-10-28,715,330-->

It is defined as {@{the negative [logarithm](logarithmic%20scale.md) of the [activity](thermodynamic%20activity.md) of [hydrogen ion](hydrogen%20ion.md) in the [solution](solution%20(chemistry).md), which is approximately the [concentration](concentration.md) of it}@}: <!--SR:!2027-06-21,1052,270-->

> {@{$\text{pH}=-\log\left(a_{\text{H}^+}\right)\approx-\log\left(\left[\text{H}^+\text{(aq)}\right]\right)$}@}
>
> where {@{\[H<sup>+</sup>(aq)\] is the [equilibrium](equilibrium%20chemistry.md) [molar concentration](molar%20concentration.md) of H<sup>+</sup>}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-27,1019,310!2027-06-05,997,352-->

Solutions where {@{\[H<sup>+</sup>(aq)\] equals \[OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)\] are neutral, the former is greater than the latter are [acidic](acid.md), and the former is lesser than the latter are [basic](base%20(chemistry).md)}@}. At {@{25 °C (77 °F), pH 7}@} is neutral. <!--SR:!2026-01-29,784,330!2027-03-26,791,250-->

## measurement

- see: [pH indicator](pH%20indicator.md)

{@{pH indicators}@} are used to {@{measure pH by measuring their color}@}. {@{A [universal indicator](universal%20indicator.md)}@} contains {@{several indicators}@} such that {@{its color changes continuously from about pH 2 to pH 10}@}. It can be {@{impregnated onto a paper to make pH papers}@}. For {@{higher accuracy}@}, {@{a [pH meter](pH%20meter.md)}@} can be used instead. <!--SR:!2028-11-25,1573,330!2026-06-03,256,210!2028-03-25,1417,350!2025-10-11,18,322!2025-10-11,18,322!2025-10-11,18,322!2025-10-11,18,322!2025-10-11,18,322-->
