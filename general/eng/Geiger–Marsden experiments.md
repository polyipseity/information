# Geiger–Marsden experiments

The __{@{Geiger–Marsden}@} experiments__ (also known as the __{@{Rutherford}@} gold foil experiment__) were {@{a series of experiments}@} that led to {@{the development of the [Rutherford model](Rutherford%20model.md) in 1911}@}. It was directed by {@{[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md) in 1909}@}. <!--SR:!2030-02-01,1901,310!2027-03-01,1029,290!2026-10-05,1046,330!2027-01-09,1005,290!2025-02-18,353,230-->

## experiment

A thin gold foil are {@{bombarded by [alpha particles](alpha%20particle.md) in an evacuated chamber}@}. The {@{deflection angles}@} are recorded. <!--SR:!2027-03-01,984,250!2030-12-17,2231,330-->

### results

Most alpha particles pass through {@{with minimal deflection}@}. Few of them pass through {@{with large deflection}@}. Even fewer {@{rebound back}@}. <!--SR:!2027-05-23,1264,350!2029-06-08,1724,310!2027-01-23,1062,290-->

### implications

The results showed that the {@{[plum pudding model](plum%20pudding%20model.md)}@} was wrong. Most of the volume of an atom is {@{empty}@} as {@{most alpha particles pass through with minimal deflection}@}. Instead, {@{the positive charge is concentrated in a tiny central region called the "nucleus"}@}. {@{Most mass is concentrated there}@} as {@{the nucleus is not deflected or moved by particles}@}. Electrons, which {@{does not affect}@} the scattering, orbit around the nucleus. This is the {@{[Rutherford model](Rutherford%20model.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2030-07-21,2110,330!2027-05-19,1259,350!2026-12-08,1028,290!2025-04-06,480,230!2027-06-08,1084,270!2025-01-24,490,250!2025-04-11,598,330!2027-01-17,1164,350-->
