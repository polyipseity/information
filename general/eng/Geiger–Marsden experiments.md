# Geiger–Marsden experiments

The __{@{Geiger–Marsden}@} experiments__ (also known as the __{@{Rutherford}@} gold foil experiment__) were {@{a series of experiments}@} that led to {@{the development of the [Rutherford model](Rutherford%20model.md)}@} in {@{1911}@}. It was directed by {@{[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md)}@} in {@{1909}@}.

## experiment

A thin gold foil are {@{bombarded by [alpha particles](alpha%20particle.md) in an evacuated chamber}@}. The {@{deflection angles}@} are recorded.

### results

Most alpha particles pass through {@{with minimal deflection}@}. Few of them pass through {@{with large deflection}@}. Even fewer {@{rebound back}@}.

### implications

The results showed that the {@{[plum pudding model](plum%20pudding%20model.md)}@} was wrong. Most of the volume of an atom is {@{empty}@} as {@{most alpha particles pass through with minimal deflection}@}. Instead, {@{the positive charge is concentrated in a tiny central region called the "nucleus"}@}. {@{Most mass is concentrated there}@} as {@{the nucleus is not deflected or moved by particles}@}. Electrons, which {@{does not affect}@} the scattering, orbit around the nucleus. This is the {@{[Rutherford model](Rutherford%20model.md)}@}.
