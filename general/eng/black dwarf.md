# black dwarf

A __black dwarf__ is {@{a theoretical [stellar remnant](compact%20object.md)}@}, specifically {@{a [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md) that has cooled sufficiently to no longer emit significant [heat](heat.md) or [light](light.md)}@}. Because {@{the time required for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current [age of the universe](age%20of%20the%20universe.md) \(13.8 billion years\)}@}, {@{no black dwarfs are expected to exist in the universe at the present time}@}. {@{The temperature of the coolest white dwarfs}@} is {@{one observational limit on the universe's age}@}. <!--SR:!2028-02-29,868,290!2028-12-28,1254,350!2026-06-23,515,310!2027-02-27,716,330!2026-01-31,90,374!2026-01-24,84,374-->

The name "black dwarf" has also been applied to {@{hypothetical late-stage cooled [brown dwarfs](brown%20dwarf.md) – [substellar objects](substellar%20object.md) with insufficient mass (less than approximately 0.07 [M<sub>☉</sub>](solar%20mass.md)) to maintain [hydrogen](hydrogen.md)-burning [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-20,478,270-->

## properties and structure

### event horizon

- see: [event horizon](event%20horizon.md)

The defining feature of a black hole is {@{the appearance of an event horizon—a boundary in [spacetime](spacetime.md) through which matter and light can pass only inward towards the mass of the black hole}@}. {@{Nothing, not even light}@}, can {@{escape from inside the event horizon}@}. The event horizon is referred to as such because {@{if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine whether such an event occurred}@}. <!--SR:!2026-12-19,641,320!2028-08-16,1155,360!2029-07-28,1430,360!2027-11-25,925,340-->

### singularity

- see: [gravitational singularity](gravitational%20singularity.md)

At the centre of a black hole, as described by {@{general relativity}@}, {@{may lie a [gravitational singularity](gravitational%20singularity.md), a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite}@}. For {@{a non-rotating black hole}@}, this region {@{takes the shape of a single point; for a rotating black hole it is smeared out to form a [ring singularity](ring%20singularity.md) that lies in the plane of rotation}@}. In both cases, {@{the singular region has zero volume}@}. It can also be shown that {@{the singular region contains all the mass of the black hole solution}@}. The singular region can thus be thought of as {@{having infinite [density](density.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-31,386,320!2029-01-27,1284,360!2029-10-30,1502,360!2027-11-14,914,340!2028-01-28,976,340!2028-10-20,1206,360!2029-07-27,1429,360-->

Observers falling into {@{a Schwarzschild black hole (i.e., non-rotating and not charged)}@} cannot {@{avoid being carried into the singularity once they cross the event horizon}@}. They can {@{prolong the experience by accelerating away to slow their descent, but only up to a limit}@}. When they {@{reach the singularity}@}, they are {@{crushed to infinite density and their mass is added to the total of the black hole}@}. Before that happens, they will {@{have been torn apart by the growing [tidal forces](tidal%20force.md)}@} in a process sometimes referred to as {@{[spaghettification](spaghettification.md) or the "noodle effect"}@}. <!--SR:!2030-05-27,1631,340!2026-05-31,499,320!2028-04-05,1034,340!2028-11-20,1136,340!2027-08-15,853,340!2026-02-02,94,373!2026-01-24,84,374-->
