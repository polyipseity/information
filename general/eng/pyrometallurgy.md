# pyrometallurgy

## calcination

Calcination is {@{the [thermal decomposition](thermal%20composition.md) of a material to extract [minerals](mineral.md)}@}. For example, {@{[silver](silver.md) can be extracted by heating [silver oxide](silver%20oxide.md)}@}.

## smelting

Smelting involves {@{heating [metal](metal.md) [oxides](oxide.md) with a [reducing agent](reducing%20agent.md) such as [carbon](carbon.md) from [coke](coke%20(fuel).md) or [charcoal](charcoal.md)}@}. For example, {@{[lead](lead.md) can be extracted from [lead(II) oxide](lead(II)%20oxide.md) by smelting it with carbon}@}.
