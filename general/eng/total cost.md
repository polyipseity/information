In {@{[economics](economics.md)}@}, {@{__total cost__ \(__TC__\)}@} is {@{the minimum financial cost of producing some quantity of output}@}. This is {@{the total [economic cost](economic%20cost.md) of production}@} and is made up of {@{[variable cost](variable%20cost.md), which varies according to the quantity of a good produced and includes inputs}@} such as {@{labor and raw materials}@}, plus {@{[fixed cost](fixed%20cost.md), which is independent of the quantity of a good produced and includes inputs that cannot be varied in the short term}@} such as {@{buildings and machinery, including possibly [sunk costs](sunk%20cost.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,325,341!2026-03-08,331,341!2026-02-20,317,341!2026-03-11,333,341!2026-09-28,474,321!2026-01-22,294,330!2025-10-24,216,321!2026-02-23,320,341-->

{@{Total cost in economics}@} includes {@{the total [opportunity cost](opportunity%20cost.md) \(benefits received from the next-best alternative\) of each [factor of production](factors%20of%20production.md) as part of its fixed or variable costs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-18,316,341!2026-05-26,361,301-->

{@{The additional total cost of one additional unit of production}@} is called {@{[marginal cost](marginal%20cost.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-19,317,341!2026-02-10,309,341-->

The marginal cost can also be {@{calculated by finding the derivative of total cost or variable cost}@}. {@{Either of these derivatives work}@} because {@{the total cost includes variable cost and fixed cost}@}, but {@{fixed cost is a constant with a derivative of 0}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-22,294,330!2026-03-11,333,341!2027-09-06,748,341!2026-02-10,309,341-->

{@{The total cost of producing a specific level of output}@} is {@{the cost of all the factors of production}@}. Often, economists use {@{models with two inputs: physical [capital](capital%20(economics).md), with quantity K and labor, with quantity L}@}. Capital is {@{assumed to be the fixed input, meaning that the amount of capital used does not vary with the level of production in the short run}@}. {@{The rental price per unit of capital}@} is {@{denoted r}@}. Thus, {@{the total fixed cost equals Kr}@}. Labor is {@{the variable input, meaning that the amount of labor used varies with the level of output}@}. In {@{the short run, the only way to vary output}@} is by {@{varying the amount of the variable input}@}. Labor usage is {@{denoted L and the per unit cost, or wage rate, is denoted w}@}, so {@{the variable cost is Lw}@}. Consequently, {@{total cost is fixed cost \(FC\) plus variable cost \(VC\)}@}, or {@{TC = FC + VC = Kr+Lw}@}. In {@{the long run, however, both capital usage and labor usage are variable}@}. {@{The long run total cost for a given output}@} will {@{generally be lower than the short run total cost}@}, because {@{the amount of capital can be chosen to be optimal for the amount of output}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-07,306,341!2027-06-25,691,341!2025-10-26,218,321!2027-09-14,755,341!2026-02-18,315,341!2026-03-06,329,341!2025-10-24,216,321!2025-10-25,217,321!2026-01-22,294,330!2026-02-08,307,341!2026-01-22,294,330!2026-02-19,316,341!2026-03-10,332,341!2026-02-21,318,341!2026-01-22,294,330!2025-10-25,217,321!2025-11-02,213,310!2025-09-21,194,321-->

Other economic models use {@{the total variable [cost curve](cost%20curve.md) \(and therefore total cost curve\)}@} to {@{illustrate the concepts of increasing, and later diminishing, marginal return}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,311,341!2025-12-10,242,321-->

In {@{marketing}@}, it is {@{necessary to know how total costs divide between variable and fixed}@}. "This distinction is crucial in {@{forecasting the earnings generated by various changes in unit sales and thus the financial impact of proposed marketing campaigns}@}."<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> In {@{a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers}@}, 60% responded that {@{they found the "variable and fixed costs" metric very useful}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-08,307,341!2028-01-17,851,341!2027-09-08,749,341!2027-07-09,703,341!2026-02-25,322,341-->
