# distance modulus

The __distance modulus__ (symbol: {@{___μ___}@}) is {@{a way of expressing [distances](distance.md) that is often used in [astronomy](astronomy.md)}@}. It describes distances on {@{a [logarithmic scale](logarithmic%20scale.md) based on the [astronomical magnitude](magnitude%20(astronomy).md) system}@}. It is defined as {@{the [apparent magnitude](apparent%20magnitude.md) $m$ of a [celestial object](astronomical%20object.md) subtracted by its [absolute magnitude](absolute%20magnitude.md) $M$: $$\mu := m - M$$}@}.

A increase of 5 in the distance modulus corresponds to {@{multiplying the distance by 10}@}, and a increase of 1 in the distance modulus corresponds to {@{multiplying the distance by $\sqrt[5]{10}$}@}. The equation (also known as the _m & M equation_) relating the actual distance to the distance modulus is: {@{$$d\text{ (in parsec)} = 10^{\frac \mu 5 + 1} = 10^{\frac {m - M} 5 + 1}$$}@}.
