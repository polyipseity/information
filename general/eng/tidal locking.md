# tidal locking

__Tidal locking__ between {@{a pair of co-[orbiting](orbit.md) [astronomical bodies](astronomical%20object.md) occurs when one of the objects reaches a state where there is no longer any net change in its [rotation rate](rotational%20frequency.md) over the course of a complete orbit}@}. Some scientific sources use it to {@{_exclusively_ refer to 1:1 synchronous rotation (e.g. the [Moon](Moon.md)) instead}@}.
