# design thinking

## as a process of designing

## as a process for innovation

### empathy

- see: [empathic design](empathic%20design.md)

### ideation: divergent and convergent thinking

Ideation consists of {@{alternation between [divergent](divergent%20thinking.md) and [convergent thinking](convergent%20thinking.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-03,301,330-->

Divergent thinking is supposed to {@{enhance creativity of thinkers}@}. During divergent thinking, having {@{a diverse group of people}@} involved is important. Good practice is {@{encouraging people to go wild with many ideas, and avoiding evaluation}@}. <!--SR:!2027-04-20,823,330!2025-06-08,304,330!2026-08-10,566,310-->

Convergent thinking is supposed to {@{find the best and the most concrete solution}@}. <!--SR:!2027-04-28,828,330-->

## applications

### in business

Design thinking can integrate {@{human values like usability and desirability, technology feasibility, and business viability}@} together for innovation. Innovation depends on {@{the context. For example, commercialization of creative ideas is the definition for venture capitalists}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-13,362,270!2025-04-09,256,330-->

User desirability describes {@{how much people want the product, depending on their needs and desires}@}. This can be achieved by {@{deeply understanding users via an empathetic design process, such as putting ourselves in the shoes of the customers}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-07,301,290!2027-04-04,754,290-->

Technology feasibility describes {@{the possibility of producing a product within allocated budget and time}@}. Three important factors to consider are {@{science and engineering, money, and time}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-26,512,310!2025-03-26,247,330-->

Business viability describes {@{how the business can survive}@}. The three important factors to consider are {@{competition, market size, and target audience}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,229,290!2027-04-23,762,290-->

The three factors above are {@{interdependent and must be balanced for a successful business}@}. Deep understanding of {@{the business model, market, and technology}@} is required. <!--SR:!2025-04-28,255,290!2026-08-10,582,290-->

Design thinking can be used in {@{design conceptualization}@}. It is the {@{most important stage of product development}@} because it is {@{at the start of the product development and requires the least effort, so it produces the highest rate of return}@}. The rate of return decreases along the stages as {@{mistakes in later stages become much more costly}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-14,574,310!2027-01-26,753,330!2026-03-21,505,310!2025-09-22,338,290-->

During ideation, we can use divergent and convergent thinking to {@{find the right problem (from many pains to a problem), and then find the right solution (from many solutions to few prototypes)}@}, but {@{do not mix these processes}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-21,465,290!2027-09-07,915,330-->
