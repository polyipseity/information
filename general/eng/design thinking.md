# design thinking

## as a process of designing

## as a process for innovation

### empathy

- see: [empathic design](empathic%20design.md)

### ideation: divergent and convergent thinking

Ideation consists of {@{alternation between [divergent](divergent%20thinking.md) and [convergent thinking](convergent%20thinking.md)}@}.

Divergent thinking is supposed to {@{enhance creativity of thinkers}@}. During divergent thinking, having {@{a diverse group of people}@} involved is important. Good practice is {@{encouraging people to go wild with many ideas, and avoiding evaluation}@}.

Convergent thinking is supposed to {@{find the best and the most concrete solution}@}.

## applications

### in business

Design thinking can integrate {@{human values like usability and desirability, technology feasibility, and business viability}@} together for innovation. Innovation depends on {@{the context. For example, commercialization of creative ideas is the definition for venture capitalists}@}.

User desirability describes {@{how much people want the product, depending on their needs and desires}@}. This can be achieved by {@{deeply understanding users via an empathetic design process, such as putting ourselves in the shoes of the customers}@}.

Technology feasibility describes {@{the possibility of producing a product within allocated budget and time}@}. Three important factors to consider are {@{science and engineering, money, and time}@}.

Business viability describes {@{how the business can survive}@}. The three important factors to consider are {@{competition, market size, and target audience}@}.

The three factors above are {@{interdependent and must be balanced for a successful business}@}. Deep understanding of {@{the business model, market, and technology}@} is required.

Design thinking can be used in {@{design conceptualization}@}. It is the {@{most important stage of product development}@} because it is {@{at the start of the product development and requires the least effort, so it produces the highest rate of return}@}. The rate of return decreases along the stages as {@{mistakes in later stages become much more costly}@}.

During ideation, we can use divergent and convergent thinking to {@{find the right problem (from many pains to a problem), and then find the right solution (from many solutions to few prototypes)}@}, but {@{do not mix these processes}@}.
