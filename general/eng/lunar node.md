# lunar node

A __lunar node__ is {@{either of the two [orbital nodes](orbital%20node.md) of the [Moon](Moon.md), that is, the two points at which the [orbit of the Moon](orbit%20of%20the%20Moon.md) [intersects](intersection%20(geometry).md) the [ecliptic](ecliptic.md)}@}. This is caused by {@{the Moon's orbital inclination (5°09′ or 5.145°) to the ecliptic}@}. The {@{_ascending_ (or _north_) node}@} is {@{where the Moon moves into the northern ecliptic hemisphere}@}, while the {@{_descending_ (or _south_)}@} node is {@{where the Moon enters the southern ecliptic hemisphere}@}. The {@{_line of nodes_}@} is {@{the line joining these two nodes}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-28,172,310!2025-08-14,244,250!2025-03-03,180,310!2025-08-12,308,330!2025-06-21,266,330!2024-12-25,115,290!2025-05-08,235,330!2025-06-17,263,330-->

## motion

The {@{line of nodes}@}, which is also {@{the [intersects](intersection%20(geometry).md) between the two respective planes}@}, {@{rotates (precesses) with a period of 18.60 years}@}. When viewed from the celestial north, the nodes move {@{clockwise around [Earth](Earth.md), i.e. with a [retrograde motion](retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) (opposite to Earth's own spin and its revolution around the [Sun](Sun.md))}@}. So the time {@{from one node crossing to the next (see [eclipse season](eclipse%20season.md)) is approximately a half-year less half of 18.6377 days, or about 173.3 days. 18.6377 days}@} is also the amount {@{an [draconic year](year.md#draconic%20year) is shorter by than a [sidereal year](sidereal%20year.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-05,136,310!2024-12-29,121,290!2025-08-21,247,250!2025-04-23,186,270!2024-12-28,97,250!2025-10-07,307,301-->
