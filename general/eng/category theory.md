{@{__Category theory__}@} is {@{a general theory of [mathematical structures](mathematical%20structure.md) and their relations}@}. It was introduced by {@{[Samuel Eilenberg](Samuel%20Eilenberg.md) and [Saunders Mac Lane](Saunders%20Mac%20Lane.md) in the middle of the 20th century}@} in their {@{foundational work on [algebraic topology](algebraic%20topology.md)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> Category theory is used in {@{almost all areas of mathematics}@}. In particular, {@{many constructions of new [mathematical objects](mathematical%20object.md) from previous ones that appear similarly in several contexts}@} are {@{conveniently expressed and unified in terms of categories}@}. Examples include {@{[quotient spaces](quotient%20space.md), [direct products](direct%20product.md), completion, and [duality](duality%20(mathematics).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-22,270,330!2026-01-19,293,330!2026-01-24,277,290!2029-01-07,1140,350!2025-12-21,271,330!2029-04-05,1207,350!2027-10-25,780,330!2026-08-31,412,270-->

{@{Many areas of [computer science](computer%20science.md)}@} also {@{rely on category theory}@}, such as {@{[functional programming](functional%20programming.md) and [semantics](semantics%20(computer%20science).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-12,288,330!2029-04-20,1219,350!2025-12-30,277,330-->

{@{A [category](category%20(mathematics).md)}@} is {@{formed by two sorts of [objects](mathematical%20object.md)}@}: {@{the [objects](category%20(mathematics).md) of the category, and the [morphisms](morphism.md), which relate two objects called the _source_ and the _target_ of the morphism}@}. Metaphorically, {@{a morphism is an arrow that maps its source to its target}@}. Morphisms can be {@{composed if the target of the first morphism equals the source of the second one}@}. Morphism composition has {@{similar properties as [function composition](function%20composition.md) \([associativity](associative%20property.md) and existence of an [identity morphism](identity%20element.md) for each object\)}@}. Morphisms are often {@{some sort of [functions](function%20(mathematics).md), but this is not always the case}@}. For example, {@{a [monoid](monoid.md)}@} may be viewed as {@{a category with a single object, whose morphisms are the elements of the monoid}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-15,289,330!2029-01-26,1154,350!2025-12-27,276,330!2029-02-02,1160,350!2028-01-18,846,330!2029-03-26,1201,350!2026-01-12,288,330!2029-02-03,1162,350!2027-12-23,826,330-->

{@{The second fundamental concept of category theory}@} is {@{the concept of a [functor](functor.md)}@}, which plays {@{the role of a morphism between two categories ${\mathcal {C} }_{1}$ and ${\mathcal {C} }_{2}$}@}: it maps {@{objects of ${\mathcal {C} }_{1}$ to objects of ${\mathcal {C} }_{2}$ and morphisms of ${\mathcal {C} }_{1}$ to morphisms of ${\mathcal {C} }_{2}$}@} in such a way that {@{sources are mapped to sources, and targets are mapped to targets}@} \(or, in the case of {@{a [contravariant functor](functor.md#covariance%20and%20contravariance), sources are mapped to targets and _vice-versa_}@}\). {@{A third fundamental concept}@} is {@{a [natural transformation](natural%20transformation.md) that may be viewed as a morphism of functors}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-20,269,330!2025-12-30,277,330!2029-02-13,1168,350!2029-03-23,1198,350!2028-11-16,1097,350!2026-01-10,286,330!2029-03-27,1200,350!2026-01-13,289,330-->

## functors

- Main article: [Functor](functor.md)

{@{[Functors](functor.md)}@} are {@{structure-preserving maps between categories}@}. They can be thought of as {@{morphisms in the category of all \(small\) categories}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-26,275,330!2026-01-03,281,330!2029-03-20,1195,350-->

- (annotation: covariant functor definition, notes) ::@:: (annotation: The object and morphism mappings are _not_ required to be injective or surjective. For example, see [constant functor](constant%20functor.md#examples), which maps every object to the same object and every morphism to the identity morphism of that object.) <!--SR:!2029-01-25,1135,349!2026-03-17,342,349-->

## natural transformations

- Main article: [Natural transformation](natural%20transformation.md)

{@{A _natural transformation_}@} is {@{a relation between two functors}@}. {@{Functors often describe "natural constructions"}@} and {@{natural transformations then describe "natural homomorphisms" between two such constructions}@}. Sometimes {@{two quite different constructions yield "the same" result}@}; this is expressed by {@{a natural isomorphism between the two functors}@}. <!--SR:!2029-01-17,1149,350!2029-04-11,1212,350!2029-02-08,1165,350!2029-04-13,1214,350!2027-03-04,549,310!2026-01-06,283,330-->

Hence, the challenge is {@{to define special objects without referring to the internal structure of those objects}@}. To {@{define the empty set without referring to elements, or the product topology without referring to open sets}@}, one can {@{characterize these objects in terms of their relations to other objects}@}, as given by {@{the morphisms of the respective categories}@}. Thus, the task is to {@{find _[universal properties](universal%20property.md)_ that uniquely determine the objects of interest}@}. <!--SR:!2029-02-17,1171,350!2027-12-01,808,330!2028-03-01,867,330!2029-01-17,1147,350!2025-12-22,272,330!2029-02-28,1180,350!2027-10-30,775,330!2026-01-06,283,330!2027-10-28,781,330!2029-02-05,1163,350-->

It is a natural question to ask: under {@{which conditions can two categories be considered _essentially the same_}@}, in the sense that {@{theorems about one category can readily be transformed into theorems about the other category}@}? {@{The major tool one employs to describe such a situation}@} is called {@{_equivalence of categories_}@}, which is given by {@{appropriate functors between two categories}@}. Categorical equivalence has found {@{[numerous applications](equivalence%20of%20categories.md#examples) in mathematics}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-14,288,330!2028-11-10,1092,350!2029-03-29,1202,350!2029-04-09,1210,350!2026-01-04,281,330!2026-01-03,281,330-->

### further concepts and results

{@{The definitions of categories and functors}@} provide {@{only the very basics of categorical algebra}@}; {@{additional important topics are listed below}@}. Although there are {@{strong interrelations between all of these topics}@}, the given order can be {@{considered as a guideline for further reading}@}. (annotation: the 3 listed below are {@{[functor category](functor%20category.md), [duality](dual%20(category%20theory).md), [adjoint functors](adjoint%20functors.md)}@}) <!--SR:!2025-12-27,276,330!2029-02-06,1164,350!2026-01-16,290,330!2027-07-21,707,330!2025-12-21,269,330!2026-01-17,291,330-->

- The [functor category](functor%20category.md) _D_<sup>_C_</sup> ::@:: has as objects the functors from _C_ to _D_ and as morphisms the natural transformations of such functors. The [Yoneda lemma](Yoneda%20lemma.md) is one of the most famous basic results of category theory; it describes representable functors in functor categories. <!--SR:!2029-02-18,1172,350!2026-01-01,279,330-->
- [Duality](dual%20(category%20theory).md): ::@:: Every statement, theorem, or definition in category theory has a _dual_ which is essentially obtained by "reversing all the arrows". If one statement is true in a category _C_ then its dual is true in the dual category _C_<sup>op</sup>. This duality, which is transparent at the level of category theory, is often obscured in applications and can lead to surprising relationships. <!--SR:!2026-01-08,285,330!2025-12-20,270,330-->
- [Adjoint functors](adjoint%20functors.md): ::@:: A functor can be left \(or right\) adjoint to another functor that maps in the opposite direction. Such a pair of adjoint functors typically arises from a construction defined by a universal property; this can be seen as a more abstract and powerful view on universal properties. <!--SR:!2026-09-23,355,230!2028-03-28,849,330-->

### higher-dimensional categories

- Main article: [Higher category theory](higher%20category%20theory.md)

{@{Many of the above concepts}@}, especially {@{equivalence of categories, adjoint functor pairs, and functor categories}@}, can be {@{situated into the context of _higher-dimensional categories_}@}. Briefly, if we consider {@{a morphism between two objects as a "process taking us from one object to another"}@}, then {@{higher-dimensional categories allow us to profitably generalize this by considering "higher-dimensional processes"}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-02,280,330!2027-09-07,739,330!2026-01-18,292,330!2029-04-15,1215,350!2026-01-03,281,330-->

For example, {@{a \(strict\) [2-category](strict%202-category.md)}@} is {@{a category together with "morphisms between morphisms"}@} \(annotation: {@{0-morphisms: objects, 1-morphisms: morphisms, 2-morphisms: "morphisms between morphisms"}@}\), i.e., {@{processes which allow us to transform one morphism into another}@}. We can then {@{"compose" these "bimorphisms" \(annotation: 2-morphisms\)}@} both {@{horizontally and vertically \(annotation: vertical composition: compose along 1-morphisms, horizontal composition: compose along 0-morphisms\)}@}, and we require {@{a 2-dimensional "exchange law" to hold}@}, relating {@{the two composition laws \(annotation: relating vertical composition and horizontal composition\)}@}. In this context, the standard example is {@{__Cat__, the 2-category of all \(small\) categories}@} \(annotation: {@{0-morphisms: small categories, 1-morphisms: functors, 2-morphisms: natural transformations}@}\), and in this example, {@{bimorphisms of morphisms}@} are {@{simply [natural transformations](natural%20transformation.md) of morphisms in the usual sense}@}. Another basic example is to {@{consider a 2-category with a single object}@}; these are essentially {@{[monoidal categories](monoidal%20category.md)}@}. {@{[Bicategories](bicategory.md)}@} are {@{a weaker notion of 2-dimensional categories}@} in which {@{the composition of morphisms \(annotation: horizontal composition\) is not strictly associative}@}, but only {@{associative "up to" an isomorphism \(annotation: depending on the order of operation, the results are "equal" up to an isomorphism\)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-01-18,1148,350!2029-03-28,1203,350!2029-02-09,1167,350!2029-04-21,1221,350!2027-03-08,554,310!2027-08-18,727,330!2026-06-26,366,290!2026-01-28,281,290!2027-02-11,536,310!2026-01-07,284,330!2029-03-19,1194,350!2026-04-06,278,250!2026-01-28,121,389!2026-09-03,286,369!2026-01-08,36,349!2026-02-05,124,389!2026-02-11,129,389!2026-02-11,129,389-->

This process can be {@{extended for all [natural numbers](natural%20number.md) _n_}@}, and these are called {@{[_n_-categories](higher%20category%20theory.md)}@}. There is even {@{a notion of _[ω-category](quasi-category.md)_}@} corresponding to {@{the [ordinal number](ordinal%20number.md) [ω](ordinal%20number.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-06,1208,350!2026-01-14,288,330!2028-01-23,850,330!2029-03-16,1192,350-->

Higher-dimensional categories are {@{part of the broader mathematical field of [higher-dimensional algebra](higher-dimensional%20algebra.md)}@}, a concept introduced by {@{[Ronald Brown](Ronald%20Brown%20(mathematician).md)}@}. For a conversational introduction to these ideas, see [John Baez, 'A Tale of _n_-categories' \(1996\).](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week73.html) <!--SR:!2026-01-12,286,330!2027-11-02,787,330-->

{@{[Stanislaw Ulam](Stanisław%20Ulam.md)}@}, and some writing on his behalf, have claimed that {@{related ideas were current in the late 1930s in Poland}@}.<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> Eilenberg was {@{Polish, and studied mathematics in Poland in the 1930s}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> Category theory is also, in some sense, {@{a continuation of the work of [Emmy Noether](Emmy%20Noether.md) \(one of Mac Lane's teachers\)}@} in {@{formalizing abstract processes}@};<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> Noether realized that {@{understanding a type of mathematical structure}@} requires {@{understanding the processes that preserve that structure \([homomorphisms](homomorphism.md)\)}@}.<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> Eilenberg and Mac Lane introduced {@{categories for understanding and formalizing the processes \([functors](functor.md)\)}@} that {@{relate [topological structures](topology.md) to algebraic structures \([topological invariants](topological%20property.md)\) that characterize them}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-14,290,330!2027-10-16,772,330!2026-04-14,331,290!2026-04-18,335,290!2026-01-01,279,330!2028-12-01,1109,350!2025-12-26,275,330!2027-08-24,731,330!2026-04-14,120,393-->

Category theory was {@{originally introduced}@} for {@{the need of [homological algebra](homological%20algebra.md)}@}, and widely extended for {@{the need of modern [algebraic geometry](algebraic%20geometry.md) \([scheme theory](scheme%20(mathematics).md)\)}@}. Category theory may be viewed as {@{an extension of [universal algebra](universal%20algebra.md)}@}, as the latter studies {@{[algebraic structures](algebraic%20structure.md)}@}, and the former applies to {@{any kind of [mathematical structure](mathematical%20structure.md) and studies also the relationships between structures of different nature}@}. For this reason, it is {@{used throughout mathematics}@}. Applications to {@{[mathematical logic](mathematical%20logic.md) and [semantics](semantics%20(computer%20science).md) \([categorical abstract machine](categorical%20abstract%20machine.md)\)}@} came later. <!--SR:!2027-05-30,665,330!2029-04-04,1207,350!2027-12-12,818,330!2029-01-08,1140,350!2028-04-05,852,330!2026-01-13,287,330!2029-03-24,1199,350!2026-01-03,25,377-->

{@{Certain categories called [topoi](topos.md) \(singular _topos_\)}@} can even {@{serve as an alternative to [axiomatic set theory](set%20theory.md#formalized%20set%20theory) as a foundation of mathematics}@}. A topos can also {@{be considered as a specific type of category with two additional topos axioms}@}. {@{These foundational applications of category theory}@} have been {@{worked out in fair detail}@} as {@{a basis for, and justification of, [constructive mathematics](constructivism%20(philosophy%20of%20mathematics).md)}@}. {@{[Topos theory](topos.md)}@} is {@{a form of abstract [sheaf theory](sheaf%20(mathematics).md), with geometric origins}@}, and leads to {@{ideas such as [pointless topology](pointless%20topology.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-11,287,330!2027-07-06,693,330!2026-06-05,386,310!2028-11-04,1087,350!2029-02-27,1179,350!2028-12-15,1119,350!2028-01-27,842,330!2027-06-01,668,330!2027-11-01,776,330-->

{@{[Categorical logic](categorical%20logic.md)}@} is now {@{a well-defined field based on [type theory](type%20theory.md) for [intuitionistic logics](intuitionistic%20logic.md)}@}, with applications in {@{[functional programming](functional%20programming.md) and [domain theory](domain%20theory.md)}@}, where {@{a [cartesian closed category](Cartesian%20closed%20category.md) is taken as a non-syntactic description of a [lambda calculus](lambda%20calculus.md)}@}. At the very least, {@{category theoretic language}@} {@{clarifies what exactly these related areas have in common \(in some [abstract](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abstract) sense\)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-02-19,1173,350!2026-01-06,283,330!2026-01-12,288,330!2026-01-18,273,290!2026-01-16,290,330!2029-04-13,1215,350-->

Category theory has been {@{applied in other fields as well}@}, see {@{[applied category theory](applied%20category%20theory.md)}@}.

But even in {@{categories whose objects have no notion of homomorphism or where the morphisms are explicitly not \(or not precisely\) homomorphisms}@}, {@{the classes ${\text{hom} }(a,b)$ are still referred to as hom-classes}@}. <a id="^ref-a"></a>^ref-a
2. b. Some authors {@{compose in the opposite order}@}, writing {@{_fg_ or _f_ ∘ _g_ for _g_ ∘ _f_}@}. {@{Computer scientists using category theory}@} very commonly write {@{_f_ ; _g_ for _g_ ∘ _f_}@} <a id="^ref-b"></a>^ref-b
3. c. {@{A morphism that is both epic and monic}@} is {@{not necessarily an isomorphism}@}. An elementary counterexample: in the category consisting of {@{two objects _A_ and _B_, the identity morphisms, and a single morphism _f_ from _A_ to _B_}@}, _f_ is {@{both epic and monic but is not an isomorphism}@}. <a id="^ref-c"></a>^ref-c <!--SR:!2026-01-11,287,330!2026-01-10,286,330!2027-11-16,797,330!2028-12-14,1120,350!2029-03-29,1204,350!2025-12-27,276,330!2029-02-08,1166,350!2026-01-08,285,330!2029-02-09,1167,350!2025-12-26,275,330!2029-04-14,1215,350!2025-12-30,277,330-->
