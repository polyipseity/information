# division of labour

- "Economic specialization" redirects here. For a list of economic specialties, see [lists of occupations](lists%20of%20occupations.md). For branches of the field, see [economics](economics.md).

The __division of labour__ is {@{the separation of the tasks in any [economic system](economic%20system.md) or [organisation](organization.md) so that participants may specialise ([specialisation](departmentalization.md))}@}. Individuals, organisations, and nations are {@{endowed with or acquire specialised capabilities}@}, and {@{either form combinations or trade to take advantage of the capabilities of others in addition to their own}@}. Specialised capabilities may {@{include equipment or [natural resources](natural%20resource.md) as well as skills}@}. {@{Training and combinations of equipment and other assets acting together}@} are often important. For example, an individual may specialise by {@{acquiring tools and the skills to use them effectively}@} just as an organisation may specialise by {@{acquiring specialised equipment and hiring or training skilled operators}@}. The division of labour is {@{the motive for [trade](trade.md) and the source of [economic interdependence](economic%20interdependence.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-21,691,330!2025-08-09,242,330!2025-09-23,279,330!2025-08-10,226,310!2025-08-25,255,330!2025-09-24,280,330!2025-10-07,290,330!2025-08-25,255,330-->

An increasing division of labour is associated with {@{the growth of total [output](output%20(economics).md) and [trade](trade.md)}@}, the rise of {@{[capitalism](capitalism.md), and the increasing complexity of [industrialised](industrialisation.md) processes}@}. The concept and implementation of division of labour has been observed in {@{ancient [Sumerian](sumer.md) ([Mesopotamian](mesopotamia.md)) culture}@}, where {@{assignment of jobs in some cities coincided with an increase in trade and economic interdependence}@}. Division of labour generally also increases {@{both producer and individual worker productivity}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-04,237,330!2025-08-08,241,330!2025-07-14,205,310!2025-08-02,218,310!2025-08-11,227,310-->

After {@{the [Neolithic Revolution](Neolithic%20Revolution.md)}@}, {@{pastoralism and agriculture}@} led to {@{more reliable and abundant food supplies}@}, which {@{increased the population and led to specialisation of labour, including new classes of artisans, warriors, and the development of elites}@}. This specialisation was furthered by {@{the process of [industrialisation](industrialisation.md), and [Industrial Revolution](Industrial%20Revolution.md)-era factories}@}. Accordingly, {@{many [classical economists](classical%20economics.md) as well as some mechanical engineers}@}, such as [Charles Babbage](Charles%20Babbage.md), were {@{proponents of division of labour}@}. Also, having {@{workers perform single or limited tasks}@} eliminated {@{the long training period required to train craftsmen}@}, who were {@{replaced with less-paid but more productive unskilled workers}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-04,287,330!2025-08-06,239,330!2025-08-14,244,330!2025-08-05,238,330!2025-06-14,183,310!2025-07-19,210,310!2025-09-14,270,330!2025-11-08,316,330!2025-07-08,202,310!2025-08-25,255,330-->
