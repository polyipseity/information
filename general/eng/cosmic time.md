# cosmic time

## reference point

There are {@{two main ways}@} for establishing a reference point for cosmic time.

### lookback time

{@{The present tim can be used as the cosmic reference point}@} creating __lookback time__. This can be described {@{in terms of the time light has taken to arrive here from a distance object}@}. Alternatively, this may be formulated as {@{the difference between the current age of the universe (13.8 billion years) and the age of the universe when the light left the distance object}@}.

Note that this may not {@{be the current distance of the object from here (converted to lightyears) as the object may have moved in the meantime}@}. For an object of which {@{light has yet to reach here}@}, lookback time is {@{undefined because we here are not even aware of the existence of such an object}@}.
