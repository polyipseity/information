# cosmic time

## reference point

There are {@{two main ways}@} for establishing a reference point for cosmic time. <!--SR:!2027-04-29,776,330-->

### lookback time

{@{The present time can be used as the cosmic reference point}@} creating __lookback time__. This can be described {@{in terms of the time light has taken to arrive here from a distance object}@}. Alternatively, this may be formulated as {@{the difference between the current age of the universe (13.8 billion years) and the age of the universe when the light left the distance object}@}. <!--SR:!2028-07-15,1147,350!2027-01-18,712,330!2028-10-21,1224,350-->

Note that this may not {@{be the current distance of the object from here (converted to lightyears) as the object may have moved in the meantime}@}. For an object of which {@{light has yet to reach here}@}, lookback time is {@{undefined because we here are not even aware of the existence of such an object}@}. <!--SR:!2029-03-01,1324,350!2029-02-10,1249,310!2026-12-15,683,330-->
