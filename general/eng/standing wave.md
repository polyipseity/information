# standing wave

## opposing waves

A _standing wave_ can be formed by {@{the [superposition](superposition%20principle.md) of two [waves](wave.md) of the same [frequency](frequency.md) with opposite propagating directions}@}. The opposite wave can be formed by, for instance, {@{[reflection](reflection%20(physics).md) from a boundary}@}. Open boundary {@{preserves the phase (negate $t$ and $\phi$; negate $A$ for sine waves)}@} while fixed boundary {@{inverts the wave (negate $t$ and $\phi$; negate $A$ for cosine waves), i.e. shifts the phase by [π](pi.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2032-09-08,2390,330!2027-12-22,1140,350!2028-03-20,777,230!2026-02-24,15,315-->

## mathematical description

> - solving [boundary value problem](boundary%20value%20problem.md) visually ::@:: One can imagine the standing wave extends beyond the boundaries forever. Then the boundary values or [functions](function%20(mathematics).md) matching the standing wave at all [times](time.md) is sufficient for a solution. <!--SR:!2026-11-05,803,340!2026-04-21,549,329-->
