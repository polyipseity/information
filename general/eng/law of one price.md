# law of one price

- For {@{the music album by Echoterra}@}, see {@{[The Law of One](The%20Law%20of%20One.md#studio%20albums)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-05,293,330!2029-07-07,1247,350-->

In {@{[economics](economics.md)}@}, {@{the __law of one price__ \(__LOOP__\)}@} states that in {@{the absence of [trade](trade.md) frictions \(such as [transport costs](transport%20cost.md) and [tariffs](tariff.md)\), and under conditions of [free competition](free%20competition.md) and price flexibility \(where no individual sellers or buyers have power to manipulate prices and prices can freely adjust\)}@}, {@{identical [goods](goods.md) sold at different locations should be sold for the same price when prices are expressed in a common [currency](currency.md)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup><sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup><sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup><sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup><sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> This law is derived from {@{the assumption of the inevitable elimination of all [arbitrage](arbitrage.md)}@}.<sup>\[_[additional citation\(s\) needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> <!--SR:!2029-05-24,1211,350!2026-02-25,285,330!2026-04-10,299,290!2029-06-20,1233,350!2029-08-29,1285,350-->

## overview

{@{The intuition behind the law of one price}@} is based on {@{the assumption that differences between prices are eliminated by market participants taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup><sup>\[_[additional citation\(s\) needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> <!--SR:!2029-05-21,1208,350!2026-03-03,291,330-->

### example in regular trade

Assume {@{different prices for a single identical good in two locations}@}, {@{no transport costs, and no economic barriers between the two locations}@}. {@{Arbitrage by both buyers and sellers}@} can then operate: buyers {@{from the expensive area can buy in the cheap area}@}, and sellers {@{in the cheap area can sell in the expensive area}@}. <!--SR:!2029-06-27,1238,350!2029-07-13,1252,350!2026-02-25,285,330!2026-03-03,291,330!2026-03-02,290,330-->

{@{Both scenarios}@} result in {@{a single, equal price per homogeneous good in all locations}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup><sup>\[_[additional citation\(s\) needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-25,285,330!2029-08-16,1274,350-->

### example in formal financial markets

{@{[Commodities](commodities.md)}@} can be {@{traded on [financial markets](financial%20markets.md)}@}, where there will be {@{a single [offer](discounts%20and%20allowances.md) price \(asking price\), and [bid price](bid%20price.md)}@}. Although {@{there is a small [spread](yield%20spread.md) between these two values}@} {@{the law of one price applies \(to each\)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-05-19,1206,350!2029-05-30,1217,350!2026-03-01,289,330!2029-05-29,1216,350!2026-02-25,285,330-->

No trader will {@{sell the commodity at a lower price than the [market maker](market%20maker.md)'s bid-level}@} or {@{[buy](trade.md) at a higher price than the market maker's offer-level}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> In either case {@{moving away from the prevailing price}@} would {@{either leave no takers, or be [charity](gift.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-07-30,609,310!2029-08-17,1274,350!2029-08-09,1268,350!2029-07-22,1260,350-->

In {@{the [derivatives](derivative%20(finance).md) market}@} the law applies to {@{[financial instruments](financial%20instrument.md) which appear different, but which resolve to the same set of cash flows}@}; see {@{[Rational pricing](rational%20pricing.md)}@}. Thus:<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-06-21,1233,350!2026-03-06,294,330!2029-07-14,1252,350-->

> {@{A security}@} must {@{have a single price, no matter how that security is created}@}. For example, if {@{an option can be created using two different sets of underlying securities}@}, then {@{the total price for each would be the same or else an arbitrage opportunity would exist}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-04,292,330!2026-02-25,285,330!2026-03-01,289,330!2029-06-08,1224,350-->

A similar argument can be used by considering {@{[arrow securities](state%20prices.md) as alluded to by Arrow and Debreu \(1944\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-02,290,330-->

### non-application

- See also: ::@:: [Purchasing power parity § Difficulties](purchasing%20power%20parity.md#difficulties) <!--SR:!2029-08-30,1286,350!2026-03-01,289,330-->

- The law does not {@{apply _intertemporally_}@}, so {@{prices for the same item can be different at different times in one market}@}. {@{The application of the law to financial markets}@} is obscured by the fact that {@{the [market maker](market%20maker.md)'s prices are continually moving in [liquid](market%20liquidity.md) markets}@}. However, at {@{the _moment_ each trade is executed}@}, {@{the law is in force \(it would normally be against exchange rules to break it\)}@}.<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup>
- The law also need not apply if {@{buyers have [less than perfect information](asymmetric%20information.md) about where to find the lowest price}@}. In this case, sellers face {@{a tradeoff between the frequency and the profitability of their sales}@}. That is, firms may be {@{indifferent between posting a high price \(thus selling infrequently, because most consumers will [search](search%20theory.md) for a lower one\)}@} and {@{a low price \(at which they will sell more often, but earn less profit per sale\)}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup><sup>\[_[additional citation\(s\) needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup>
- {@{[The Balassa–Samuelson effect](Balassa-Samuelson%20effect.md#how%20identical%20products%20can%20be%20sold%20at%20consistently%20different%20prices%20in%20different%20places)}@} argues that {@{the law of one price is not applicable to all goods internationally}@}, because {@{some goods are not [tradable](tradable.md)}@}. It argues that {@{the consumption may be cheaper in some countries than others}@}, because {@{nontradables \(especially land and labor\) are cheaper in less-developed countries}@}. This can make {@{a typical consumption basket cheaper in a less-developed country}@}, even if {@{some goods in that basket have their prices equalized by international trade}@}.<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> <!--SR:!2029-06-02,1219,350!2029-08-28,1284,350!2026-03-04,292,330!2026-03-02,290,330!2026-03-05,293,330!2026-03-02,290,330!2026-02-25,285,330!2026-03-01,289,330!2027-07-18,674,330!2029-06-16,1229,350!2026-03-06,294,330!2029-08-23,1279,350!2026-02-25,285,330!2026-03-04,292,330!2026-03-06,294,330!2026-03-06,294,330!2029-06-18,1232,350-->

### prerequisite

\(annotation: prerequisites: 3 items: {@{absence of trade frictions, free competition, price flexibility}@}\) <!--SR:!2027-12-26,796,330-->

- absence of trade frictions
- free competition
- price flexibility<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup>

The law of one price has been applied towards {@{the analysis of many public events}@}, such as: <!--SR:!2026-03-05,293,330-->

- In 2015, An [International Monetary Fund](International%20Monetary%20Fund.md) working paper found that the law of one price holds for most tradeable products in [Brazil](Brazil.md) but does not apply in the same way to its non-tradeable goods.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup>
- A director of the [Council on Foreign Relations](Council%20on%20Foreign%20Relations.md) held in 2013 that the then-current [Apple](Apple%20Inc..md) [iPad mini](iPad%20mini.md) followed the law of one price, as far as its price nearly reached the same [US dollar](US%20dollar.md) [exchange rate](exchange%20rate.md) in each applicable country.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup>
- Indonesian governmental oil subsidies against oil smugglers; The smugglers selling stolen government-discounted oil back to its [market rate](market%20rate.md).<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup>
- An apparent violation of the law involving international [Royal Dutch](Royal%20Dutch%20Shell.md)/[Shell](Shell%20Oil%20Company.md) stocks. After merging in 1907, holders of Royal Dutch Petroleum \(traded in Amsterdam\) and Shell Transport shares \(traded in London\) were entitled to 60% and 40% respectively of all future profits. Royal Dutch shares should therefore automatically have been priced at 50% more than Shell shares. However, they diverged from this by up to 15%.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup><sup>\[_[additional citation\(s\) needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> This discrepancy disappeared with their final merger in 2005.<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> In recent years the company has had two different shares, "A" and "B" shares. Although each carries the same rights to dividends etc, they usually trade at different prices. This can be explained by different tax treatments.

This paper presents the first assessment domestic market integration in Brazil using the law of one price. The law of one price is tested using two panel unit root methodologies and a unique data set comprising price indices for 51 products across 11 metro-areas. We find that the law of one price holds for most tradable products and, not surprisingly, non-tradable products are found to be less likely to satisfy the law of one price. While these findings are consistent with evidence found for other countries, price convergence occurs very slowly in Brazil, suggesting relatively limited domestic market integration. <a id="^ref-11"></a>^ref-11
