# Cepheid variable

{@{A __Cepheid variable__}@} ({@{[/ˈsɛfi.ɪd, ˈsiːfi-/]}@}) is {@{a type of [variable star](variable%20star.md) that [pulsates radially](instability%20strip.md), varying in both diameter and temperature}@}. It changes {@{in brightness, with a well-defined stable [period](frequency.md) and amplitude}@}.

Cepheids are {@{important cosmic benchmarks for scaling [galactic and extragalactic distances](cosmic%20distance%20ladder.md)}@}. A strong direct [relationship](period-luminosity%20relation.md) exists between {@{a Cepheid variable's [luminosity](luminosity.md) and its [pulsation period](periodic%20function.md)}@}. Cepheids change {@{brightness due to the [κ–mechanism](kappa–mechanism.md)}@}, which occurs when {@{opacity in a star increases with temperature rather than decreasing}@}. The main gas involved is {@{thought to be helium}@}. First, {@{the outer layer of the star contracts}@}, heating {@{due to compression until the helium [doubly ionizes](double%20ionization.md), becoming much more opaque}@}. This causes it to {@{accumulate heat, causing a build-up of pressure that forces the layer back out again until it cools enough to become singly ionized again}@}. The helium, {@{now transparent and not accumulating as much heat and pressure}@}, {@{contracts again to restart the cycle}@}. Cepheid variables become {@{dimmest during the part of the cycle when the helium is doubly ionized}@}.

This characteristic of classical Cepheids was {@{discovered in 1908 by [Henrietta Swan Leavitt](Henrietta%20Swan%20Leavitt.md)}@} after {@{studying thousands of variable stars in the [Magellanic Clouds](Magellanic%20Clouds.md)}@}. The discovery {@{establishes the _true luminosity_ of a Cepheid by observing its pulsation period}@}. This in turn {@{gives the distance to the star by comparing its known luminosity to its observed brightness}@}, calibrated by {@{directly observing the [parallax](parallax%20in%20astronomy.md) distance to the closest Cepheids such as RS Puppis and [Polaris](polaris.md)}@}.

The term _Cepheid_ originates from {@{[Delta Cephei](Delta%20Cephei.md) in the constellation [Cepheus](Cepheus%20(constellation).md)}@}, identified by {@{[John Goodricke](John%20Goodricke.md) in 1784}@}. It was {@{the first of its type to be identified}@}.
