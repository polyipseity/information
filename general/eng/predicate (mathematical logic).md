# predicate

In [logic](mathematical%20logic.md), a __predicate__ is {@{a symbol that represents a property or a relation}@}. For instance, in {@{the [first-order formula](first-order%20logic.md) $P(a)$}@}, the symbol $P$ is {@{a predicate that applies to the [individual constant](non-logical%20symbol.md) $a$}@}. Similarly, in {@{the formula $R(a,b)$}@}, the symbol $R$ is {@{a predicate that applies to the individual constants $a$ and $b$}@}. <!--SR:!2027-02-14,677,330!2027-10-15,862,330!2027-04-03,712,330!2027-08-10,811,330!2027-09-23,845,330-->

According to [Gottlob Frege](Gottlob%20Frege.md), the __meaning__ of a _predicate_ is {@{exactly a function from the _domain_ of objects to the truth-values "true" and "false"}@}. <!--SR:!2027-06-26,773,330-->

In the [semantics of logic](semantics%20of%20logic.md), predicates are {@{interpreted as [relations](relation%20(mathematics).md)}@}. For instance, in {@{a standard semantics for first-order logic}@}, the formula $R(a,b)$ would be {@{true on an [interpretation](interpretation%20(logic).md) if the entities denoted by $a$ and $b$ stand in the relation denoted by $R$}@}. Since {@{predicates are [non-logical symbols](non-logical%20symbol.md)}@}, they can {@{denote different relations depending on the interpretation given to them}@}. While [first-order logic](first-order%20logic.md) only includes predicates that {@{apply to individual objects}@}, other logics may allow {@{predicates that apply to collections of objects defined by other predicates}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-13,753,290!2026-02-03,346,290!2026-10-12,581,330!2028-05-10,1039,350!2027-05-08,739,330!2026-03-04,137,270!2025-11-09,18,333-->
