# flat Earth

__Flat Earth__ is {@{an archaic and scientifically disproven conception of the [Earth's shape](figure%20of%20the%20Earth.md) as a [plane](Euclidean%20plane.md) or [disk](disk%20(mathematics).md)}@}. Many ancient cultures subscribed to {@{a flat-Earth cosmography, notably including [ancient near eastern cosmology](ancient%20near%20eastern%20cosmology.md)}@}. The model has {@{undergone a [recent resurgence](modern%20flat%20Earth%20beliefs.md) as a [conspiracy theory](conspiracy%20theory.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-30,209,330!2025-03-21,188,310!2025-02-27,182,310-->

#### Greece: spherical Earth

The Earth's circumference was first determined {@{around 240 BC by [Eratosthenes](Eratosthenes.md)}@} using {@{the difference in angles of shadow of 2 vertical rods in [Alexandria](Alexandria.md) and [Syene](Aswan.md) (modern Aswan)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-30,114,230!2025-06-15,222,270-->
