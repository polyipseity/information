# precision and recall

__Precision__ (also called {@{[positive predictive value](positive%20and%20negative%20predictive%20values.md)}@}) is {@{the fraction of relevant retrieved instances or true positives among the retrieved instances or positives}@}. Written as a formula: {@{$$\text{precision} = \frac {\text{relevant retrieved} } {\text{retrieved} } = \frac {\text{TP} } {\text{P} } = \frac {\text{TP} } {\text{TP} + \text{FP} }$$}@}, where {@{TP are true positives and FP are false positives (see [false positives and false negatives](false%20positives%20and%20false%20negatives.md))}@}.

__Recall__ (also called {@{[sensitivity](sensitivity%20and%20specificity.md)}@}) is {@{the fraction of relevant retrieved instances or true positives among the relevant instances or true positives and false negatives}@}. Written as a formula: {@{$$\text{recall} = \frac {\text{relevant retrieved} } {\text{relevant} } = \frac {\text{TP} } {\text{TP} + \text{FN} }$$}@}, where {@{TP are true positives and FN are false negatives (see [false positives and false negatives](false%20positives%20and%20false%20negatives.md))}@}.
