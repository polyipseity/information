# Galileo's ship

## 1632 thought experiment

To prove the point [Galileo](Galileo%20Galilei.md)'s {@{fictional advocate Salviati}@} proposed the experiment described below to {@{show the classical [principle of relativity](principle%20of%20relativity.md)}@} according to which there is {@{no internal observation (i.e. without, as it were, looking out the window) by which one can distinguish between a system moving uniformly from one at rest}@}. Hence, {@{any two systems moving without [acceleration](acceleration.md)}@} are equivalent, and {@{unaccelerated motion}@} is relative. <!--SR:!2025-05-20,235,330!2025-05-07,226,330!2025-07-02,250,290!2027-06-29,806,330!2025-06-17,258,330-->
