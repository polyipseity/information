# elliptical galaxy

An __elliptical galaxy__ (denoted {@{E}@}) is {@{a type of [galaxy](galaxy.md) with an approximately [ellipsoidal](ellipsoid.md) shape and a smooth, nearly featureless image}@}. They are {@{one of the four main [classes of galaxy](galaxy%20morphological%20classification.md) described by [Edwin Hubble](Edwin%20Hubble.md)}@} in {@{his [Hubble sequence](Hubble%20sequence.md#physical%20significance) and 1936 work _The Realm of the Nebulae_}@}, along with {@{[spiral](spiral%20galaxy.md) and [lenticular](lenticular%20galaxy.md) galaxies}@}. Elliptical galaxies are, together with {@{lenticular galaxies (S0) with their large-scale disks, and ES galaxies with their intermediate scale disks}@}, a subset of {@{the "early-type" galaxy population}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,160,310!2025-06-17,223,310!2025-05-11,206,310!2025-09-09,310,330!2025-06-13,197,270!2025-01-10,85,230!2025-01-14,118,290-->
