# elliptical galaxy

An __elliptical galaxy__ (denoted {@{E}@}) is {@{a type of [galaxy](galaxy.md) with an approximately [ellipsoidal](ellipsoid.md) shape and a smooth, nearly featureless image}@}. They are {@{one of the four main [classes of galaxy](galaxy%20morphological%20classification.md) described by [Edwin Hubble](Edwin%20Hubble.md)}@} in {@{his [Hubble sequence](Hubble%20sequence.md#physical%20significance) and 1936 work _The Realm of the Nebulae_}@}, along with {@{[spiral](spiral%20galaxy.md) and [lenticular](lenticular%20galaxy.md) galaxies}@}. Elliptical galaxies are, together with {@{lenticular galaxies (S0) with their large-scale disks, and ES galaxies with their intermediate scale disks}@}, a subset of {@{the "early-type" galaxy population}@}. <!--SR:!2027-01-22,686,330!2028-01-30,957,330!2027-10-18,885,330!2025-09-09,310,330!2027-06-23,740,290!2025-07-08,134,230!2026-05-04,475,310-->
