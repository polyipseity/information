# absorption spectroscopy

## absorption spectrum

A material's absorption spectrum is {@{the fraction of incident radiation absorbed by the material over a range of [frequencies](frequency.md) of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) due to [electrons](electron.md) making a [transition](atomic%20electron%20transition.md) from a lower [energy level](energy%20level.md) to a higher energy level}@}. <!--SR:!2026-10-27,521,270-->

### relation to emission spectrum

[Emission](emission%20spectrum.md) is {@{a process by which a substance releases [energy](energy.md) in the form of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md)}@}. Emission can {@{occur at any [frequency](frequency.md) at which absorption can occur, and this allows the absorption lines to be determined from an emission spectrum}@}. However, the emission spectrum will {@{typically have a quite different intensity pattern from the absorption spectrum, so the two are not equivalent}@}. The absorption spectrum can be calculated from the emission spectrum using {@{[Einstein coefficients](Einstein%20coefficients.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-02-03,704,330!2028-01-18,987,350!2026-01-18,360,290!2026-07-22,506,310-->
