# economic equilibrium

In [economics](economics.md), __economic equilibrium__ is {@{a situation in which economic forces such as [supply and demand](supply%20and%20demand.md) are balanced}@} and {@{in the absence of external influences the ([equilibrium](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/equilibrium)) values of economic variables will not change}@}. For example, in {@{the standard text [perfect competition](perfect%20competition.md)}@}, equilibrium occurs at {@{the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-08,68,325!2025-02-13,72,325!2025-01-27,58,310!2025-02-16,75,325-->

__Market equilibrium__ in this case is {@{a condition where a market [price](price.md) is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by [buyers](supply%20and%20demand.md) is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by [sellers](supply%20and%20demand.md)}@}. This price is often called {@{the __competitive price__ or [market clearing](market%20clearing.md) price}@} and will {@{tend not to change unless demand or supply changes, and quantity is called the "competitive quantity" or market clearing quantity}@}. But {@{the concept of _equilibrium_ in economics}@} also applies to {@{[imperfectly competitive](imperfect%20competition.md) markets, where it takes the form of a [Nash equilibrium](Nash%20equilibrium.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-03,38,305!2025-02-14,73,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-16,75,325-->

## understanding economic equilibrium

An economic equilibrium is {@{a situation when the economic agent cannot change the situation by adopting any strategy}@}. The concept has been {@{borrowed from the physical sciences}@}. Take {@{a system where physical forces are balanced for instance}@}. This economically interpreted means {@{no further change ensues}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-04,39,305!2025-01-23,51,305!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-01-26,57,310-->

## properties of equilibrium

{@{Three basic properties of equilibrium in general}@} have been proposed by [Huw Dixon](Huw%20Dixon.md).<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> These are: <!--SR:!2025-01-03,38,305-->

- Equilibrium property P1: ::@:: The behavior of agents is consistent. <!--SR:!2025-02-09,69,325!2025-01-25,56,310-->
- Equilibrium property P2: ::@:: No agent has an incentive to change its behavior. <!--SR:!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-01-22,50,305-->
- Equilibrium property P3: ::@:: Equilibrium is the outcome of some dynamic process (stability). <!--SR:!2025-02-09,69,325!2025-01-26,57,310-->

### example: competitive equilibrium

> - B – excess supply – ::@:: when P>P<sub>0</sub> <!--SR:!2025-02-10,70,325!2025-02-16,75,325-->

In {@{a [competitive equilibrium](competitive%20equilibrium.md)}@}, {@{supply equals demand}@}. Property P1 is satisfied, because {@{at the equilibrium price the amount supplied is equal to the amount demanded}@}. Property P2 is also satisfied. Demand is {@{chosen to maximize utility given the market price: no one on the demand side has any incentive to demand more or less at the prevailing price}@}. Likewise supply is {@{determined by firms maximizing their profits at the market price: no firm will want to supply any more or less at the equilibrium price}@}. Hence, {@{agents on neither the demand side nor the supply side will have any incentive to alter their actions}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-08,68,325!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-01-04,39,290!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-01-07,42,305!2025-02-10,69,325-->

To see whether Property P3 is satisfied, consider {@{what happens when the price is above the equilibrium}@}. In this case {@{there is an excess supply, with the quantity supplied exceeding that demanded}@}. This will tend to {@{put downward pressure on the price to make it return to equilibrium}@}. Likewise where {@{the price is below the equilibrium point (also known as the "sweet spot"<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup>)}@} there is {@{a shortage in supply leading to an increase in prices back to equilibrium}@}. {@{Not all equilibria}@} are {@{"stable" in the sense of equilibrium property P3}@}. It is possible to {@{have competitive equilibria that are unstable}@}. However, if {@{an equilibrium is unstable}@}, it {@{raises the question of reaching it}@}. Even if {@{it satisfies properties P1 and P2}@}, the absence of P3 means that {@{the market can only be in the unstable equilibrium if it starts off there}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-25,56,310!2025-01-25,56,310!2025-01-31,61,310!2025-02-14,73,325!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-01-04,39,290!2025-01-04,39,305!2025-01-04,39,290!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-01-26,57,310!2025-02-03,64,325!2025-02-13,72,325-->

In {@{most simple microeconomic stories of supply and demand}@} {@{a __static equilibrium__ is observed in a market}@}; however, economic equilibrium can be also {@{[dynamic](dynamic%20equilibrium.md)}@}. Equilibrium may also be {@{economy-wide or [general](general%20equilibrium%20theory.md), as opposed to the [partial equilibrium](partial%20equilibrium.md) of a single market}@}. Equilibrium can change if {@{there is a change in demand or supply conditions}@}. For example, {@{an increase in supply}@} will {@{disrupt the equilibrium, leading to lower prices}@}. Eventually, {@{a new equilibrium will be attained in most markets}@}. Then, there will be {@{no change in price or the amount of output bought and sold}@} — until there is {@{an [exogenous](exogenous%20and%20endogenous%20variables.md) shift in supply or demand}@} (such as {@{changes in [technology](technology.md) or [tastes](preference.md)}@}). That is, there are {@{no [endogenous](endogeneity%20(econometrics).md) forces leading to the price or the quantity}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-01-03,39,305!2025-01-31,61,325!2025-02-14,73,325!2025-02-13,72,325!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-10,70,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-06,66,310!2025-01-30,60,310-->

### example: monopolist equilibrium

In {@{a monopoly}@}, {@{marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC)}@}. {@{The equilibrium quantity}@} is obtained from where {@{MR and MC intersect and the equilibrium price can be found on the demand curve where MR = MC}@}. Property P1 is {@{not satisfied because the amount demand and the amount supplied at the equilibrium price are not equal}@}. Property P2 is {@{not satisfied. Because the monopolist's profit-maximizing quantity is different from the socially-maximizing quantity, consumers have an incentive to demand more at the equilibrium price}@}. However, {@{at the market price, monopolists maximize their profits so they have no incentive to change their price}@}. Therefore, {@{agents on the demand side have an incentive to alter their actions}@} while {@{the agents on the supply side do not have any incentive to alter their actions}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-03,64,325!2025-01-30,60,310!2025-01-31,61,325!2025-02-12,71,325!2025-01-31,61,310!2025-03-25,88,270!2025-06-01,151,310!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-09,69,325-->

In order to {@{determine if Property P3 is satisfied}@}, {@{the same situations used to determine P3 in a competitive equilibrium}@} can be used. When {@{there is an excess in supply}@}, monopolists will {@{realize that the equilibrium is not at the profit-maximizing quantity}@} and will {@{put upward pressure on the price to make it return to equilibrium}@}. This is the same case when {@{the price is above the equilibrium and the shortage in supply}@} leads the monopolist to {@{decrease the supply to return to the profit-maximizing quantity}@}. Therefore {@{the equilibrium is the result of stability}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-12,71,325!2025-02-11,70,325!2025-02-07,67,310!2025-01-08,43,305!2025-02-11,70,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-16,75,325-->

### example: Nash equilibrium

- see: [Nash equilibrium](Nash%20equilibrium.md), [Cournot model](Cournot%20competition.md)

> {@{![Equilibrium quantities as a solution to two reaction functions in Cournot duopoly.](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Economics%20Cournot%20diag4.svg)}@}
>
> {@{Equilibrium quantities as a solution to two reaction functions in Cournot duopoly}@}. {@{Firm 1's reaction function q1=R1(q2)}@} gives {@{its optimal output q1 to a given output q2 of firm 2}@}. Likewise, {@{firm 2's reaction function q2=R2(q1)}@}. {@{The _Cournot-Nash equilibrium_ occurs}@} where {@{the two reaction functions intersect and both firms are choosing the optimal output given the output of the other firm}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-13,72,325!2025-02-10,70,325!2025-01-31,61,325!2025-02-03,64,325!2025-01-08,39,290!2025-04-30,124,290-->

{@{The Nash equilibrium}@} is widely used in economics as {@{the main alternative to competitive equilibrium}@}. It is used whenever {@{there is a strategic element to the behavior of agents and the "price taking" assumption of competitive equilibrium is inappropriate}@}. {@{The first use of the Nash equilibrium}@} was {@{in the [Cournot duopoly](Cournot%20competition.md)}@} as developed by {@{[Antoine Augustin Cournot](Antoine%20Augustin%20Cournot.md) in his 1838 book}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> Both firms produce {@{a homogenous product}@}: given {@{the total amount supplied by the two firms}@}, {@{the (single) industry price}@} is determined {@{using the demand curve}@}. This determines {@{the revenues of each firm (the industry price times the quantity supplied by the firm)}@}. {@{The profit of each firm}@} is then {@{this revenue minus the cost of producing the output}@}. Clearly, there is {@{a _strategic interdependence_ between the two firms}@}. If {@{one firm varies its output}@}, this will {@{in turn affect the market price and so the revenue and profits of the other firm}@}. We can {@{define the payoff function}@} which {@{gives the profit of each firm as a function of the two outputs chosen by the firms}@}. Cournot assumed that {@{each firm chooses its own output to maximize its profits given the output of the other firm}@}. {@{The Nash equilibrium occurs}@} when {@{both firms are producing the outputs which maximize their own profit given the output of the other firm}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-11,70,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-08,68,325!2025-02-10,69,325!2025-01-25,56,310!2025-02-24,67,265!2025-02-06,66,310!2025-02-13,72,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-12,71,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-06-02,152,310!2025-02-07,67,310!2025-01-22,50,305!2025-02-14,73,325!2025-01-27,58,310!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-13,58,250!2025-01-25,56,310!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-01-03,38,305-->

In terms of the equilibrium properties, we can see that {@{P2 is satisfied}@}: in {@{a Nash equilibrium, neither firm has an incentive to deviate from the Nash equilibrium given the output of the other firm}@}. {@{P1 is satisfied}@} since {@{the payoff function ensures that the market price is consistent with the outputs supplied}@} and that {@{each firms profits equal revenue minus cost at this output}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-06,66,310!2025-04-18,107,290!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-03,64,325!2025-02-13,72,325-->

{@{Is the equilibrium stable}@} as required by P3? {@{Cournot himself argued that it was stable}@} using {@{the stability concept implied by [best response dynamics](best%20response.md)}@}. The reaction function for each firm gives {@{the output which maximizes profits (best response) in terms of output for a firm in terms of a given output of the other firm}@}. In {@{the standard Cournot model}@} this is {@{downward sloping: if the other firm produces a higher output, the best response involves producing less}@}. {@{Best response dynamics}@} involves {@{firms starting from some arbitrary position and then adjusting output to their best-response to the previous output of the other firm}@}. So long as {@{the reaction functions have a slope of less than -1}@}, this will {@{converge to the Nash equilibrium}@}. However, this stability story is {@{open to much criticism}@}. As {@{Dixon}@} argues: "_The crucial weakness is that, at each step, the firms {@{behave myopically: they choose their output to maximize their current profits given the output of the other firm}@}, but {@{ignore the fact that the process specifies that the other firm will adjust its output}@}_...".<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> There are {@{other concepts of stability that have been put forward for the Nash equilibrium}@}, {@{[evolutionary stability](evolutionarily%20stable%20strategy.md)}@} for example. <!--SR:!2025-02-10,69,325!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-12,71,325!2025-02-11,70,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-10,69,325!2025-02-12,71,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-01-04,39,290!2025-02-02,63,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-01-17,47,305!2025-02-03,64,325!2025-02-12,71,325!2025-01-31,61,325!2025-01-08,43,305-->

## market clearing prices

{@{Most economists, for example [Paul Samuelson](Paul%20Samuelson.md)}@},<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> caution against {@{attaching a [normative](positive%20and%20normative%20economics.md) meaning (value judgement) to the equilibrium price}@}. For example, food markets may be {@{in equilibrium at the same time that people are starving (because they cannot afford to pay the high equilibrium price)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-14,73,325!2025-01-31,61,310-->

Indeed, this occurred during {@{the [Great Famine](Great%20Famine%20(Ireland).md) in [Ireland](Ireland.md) in 1845–52}@}, where {@{[food was exported](Great%20Famine%20(Ireland).md#food%20exports%20during%20Famine) though people were starving}@}, due to {@{the greater profits in selling to the English – the equilibrium price of the Irish-British market for potatoes was above the price that Irish farmers could afford}@}, and thus {@{(among other reasons) they starved}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-01-15,18,265!2025-01-19,48,305!2025-02-08,68,325!2025-02-11,71,325-->

## interpretations

In {@{most interpretations, [classical economists](classical%20economics.md) such as [Adam Smith](Adam%20Smith.md)}@} maintained that {@{the [free market](free%20market.md) would tend towards economic equilibrium through the [price mechanism](price%20mechanism.md)}@}. That is, {@{any excess supply (market surplus or glut) would lead to _price cuts_}@}, which {@{decrease the quantity supplied (by reducing the incentive to produce and sell the product) and increase the quantity demanded (by offering consumers bargains)}@}, automatically {@{abolishing the glut}@}. Similarly, in an unfettered market, {@{any excess demand (or shortage) would lead to _price increases_}@}, reducing {@{the quantity demanded (as customers are priced out of the market) and increasing in the quantity supplied (as the incentive to produce and sell a product rises)}@}. As before, {@{the disequilibrium (here, the shortage) disappears}@}. {@{This automatic abolition of [non-market-clearing](market%20clearing.md) situations}@} distinguishes {@{markets from [central planning](planned%20economy.md#central%20planning) schemes}@}, which {@{often have a difficult time getting prices right and suffer from persistent shortages of goods and services}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-01-31,61,310!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-06,66,310!2025-02-10,70,325!2025-02-03,64,325!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-01-31,61,310!2025-02-14,73,325!2025-03-01,70,270!2025-01-27,58,310!2025-02-11,70,325-->

This view {@{came under attack from at least two viewpoints}@}. {@{Modern [mainstream economics](mainstream%20economics.md)}@} points to {@{cases where equilibrium does not correspond to market clearing (but instead to [unemployment](unemployment.md))}@}, as with {@{the [efficiency wage hypothesis](efficiency%20wage.md) in [labor economics](labour%20economics.md)}@}. In some ways parallel is {@{the phenomenon of [credit rationing](credit%20rationing.md)}@}, in which {@{banks hold interest rates low to create an excess demand for loans, so they can pick and choose whom to lend to}@}. Further, economic equilibrium can correspond with {@{[monopoly](monopoly.md), where the monopolistic firm maintains an artificial shortage to prop up prices and to maximize profits}@}. Finally, {@{[Keynesian macroeconomics](Keynesian%20economics.md)}@} points to {@{[underemployment equilibrium](underemployment.md)}@}, where {@{a surplus of labor (i.e., [cyclical unemployment](unemployment.md#cyclical%20unemployment)) co-exists for a long time with a shortage of [aggregate demand](aggregate%20demand.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-11,71,325!2025-01-26,57,310!2025-02-12,71,325!2025-02-12,71,325!2025-06-02,152,310!2025-01-31,61,325!2025-02-11,70,325!2025-05-31,150,310!2025-01-04,39,290!2025-01-31,61,310-->

## solving for the competitive equilibrium price

To {@{find the equilibrium price}@}, one must either {@{plot the supply and demand curves, or solve for the expressions for supply and demand being equal}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-14,73,325-->

An example may be:

$${\begin{alignedat}{2}Q_{s}&=125+1.5\cdot P\\Q_{d}&=189-2.25\cdot P\\\\Q_{s}&=Q_{d}\\\\125+1.5\cdot P&=189-2.25\cdot P\\(1.5+2.25)\cdot P&=(189-125)\\P&={\frac {189-125}{1.5+2.25} }\\P&={\frac {64}{3.75} }\\P&=17.067\\\end{alignedat} }$$

In the diagram, depicting {@{simple set of supply and demand curves}@}, {@{the quantity demanded and supplied at price __P__}@} are equal. <!--SR:!2025-01-31,61,310!2025-02-16,75,325-->

{@{At any price above __P__ supply exceeds demand}@}, while {@{at a price below __P__ the quantity demanded exceeds that supplied}@}. In other words, {@{prices where demand and supply are out of balance}@} are termed {@{points of disequilibrium, creating shortages and oversupply}@}. Changes in {@{the conditions of demand or supply}@} will {@{shift the demand or supply curves}@}. This will {@{cause changes in the equilibrium price and quantity in the market}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-07,67,310!2025-02-09,69,325!2025-02-03,64,325!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-14,73,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-13,72,325-->

Consider the following demand and supply schedule:

| __Price ($)__ | __Demand__  | __Supply__  |
| -------------:| -----------:| -----------:|
| 8.00          | 6&nbsp;000  | 18&nbsp;000 |
| 7.00          | 8&nbsp;000  | 16&nbsp;000 |
| 6.00          | 10&nbsp;000 | 14&nbsp;000 |
| 5.00          | 12&nbsp;000 | 12&nbsp;000 |
| 4.00          | 14&nbsp;000 | 10&nbsp;000 |
| 3.00          | 16&nbsp;000 | 8&nbsp;000  |
| 2.00          | 18&nbsp;000 | 6&nbsp;000  |
| 1.00          | 20&nbsp;000 | 4&nbsp;000  |

- The equilibrium price in the market is \$5.00 where ::@:: demand and supply are equal at 12&nbsp;000 units <!--SR:!2025-01-27,58,310!2025-02-16,75,325-->
- If the current market price was \$3.00 (<\$5.00) – ::@:: there would be excess demand for 8&nbsp;000 units, creating a shortage. <!--SR:!2025-02-13,72,325!2025-02-16,75,325-->
- If the current market price was \$8.00 (>\$5.00) – ::@:: there would be excess supply of 12&nbsp;000 units. <!--SR:!2025-01-31,61,310!2025-02-06,66,310-->

When {@{there is a shortage in the market}@} we see that, to {@{correct this disequilibrium, the price of the good will be increased back to a price of \$5.00}@}, thus {@{lessening the quantity demanded and increasing the quantity supplied thus that the market is in balance}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-12,71,325!2025-02-14,73,325!2025-01-23,51,305-->

When {@{there is an oversupply of a good}@}, such as when price is above \$6.00, then we see that {@{producers will decrease the price to increase the quantity demanded for the good}@}, thus {@{eliminating the excess and taking the market back to equilibrium}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-09,69,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-06-01,151,310-->

{@{A change in equilibrium price}@} may occur through {@{a change in either the supply or demand schedules}@}. For instance, starting from the above supply-demand configuration, {@{an increased level of [disposable income](disposable%20income.md)}@} may {@{produce a new demand schedule}@}, such as the following: <!--SR:!2025-02-07,67,310!2025-01-29,59,310!2025-01-09,40,290!2025-01-26,57,310-->

| __Price ($)__ | __Demand__  | __Supply__  |
| -------------:| -----------:| -----------:|
| 8.00          | 10&nbsp;000 | 18&nbsp;000 |
| 7.00          | 12&nbsp;000 | 16&nbsp;000 |
| 6.00          | 14&nbsp;000 | 14&nbsp;000 |
| 5.00          | 16&nbsp;000 | 12&nbsp;000 |
| 4.00          | 18&nbsp;000 | 10&nbsp;000 |
| 3.00          | 20&nbsp;000 | 8&nbsp;000  |
| 2.00          | 22&nbsp;000 | 6&nbsp;000  |
| 1.00          | 24&nbsp;000 | 4&nbsp;000  |

Here we see that {@{an increase in disposable income}@} would {@{increase the quantity demanded of the good by 2,000 units at each price}@}. This increase in demand would have the effect of {@{shifting the demand curve rightward}@}. The result is {@{a change in the price at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded}@}. In this case we see that {@{the two now equal each other at an increased price of $6.00}@}. {@{A decrease in disposable income}@} would {@{have the exact opposite effect on the market equilibrium}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-25,56,310!2025-02-14,73,325!2025-02-13,72,325!2025-02-11,71,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-10,70,325-->

We will also see similar behaviour in price when {@{there is a change in the supply schedule}@}, occurring through {@{technological changes, or through changes in business costs}@}. {@{An increase in technological usage or know-how or a decrease in costs}@} would have the effect of {@{increasing the quantity supplied at each price, thus reducing the equilibrium price}@}. On the other hand, {@{a decrease in technology or increase in business costs}@} will {@{decrease the quantity supplied at each price, thus increasing equilibrium price}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-01-03,38,305-->

The process of {@{comparing two static equilibria to each other}@}, as in the above example, is known as {@{[comparative statics](comparative%20statics.md)}@}. For example, since {@{a rise in consumers' income leads to a higher price (and a decline in consumers' income leads to a fall in the price — in each case the two things change in the same direction)}@}, we say that {@{the comparative static effect of consumer income on the price is positive}@}. This is another way of saying that {@{the [total derivative](total%20derivative.md) of price with respect to consumer income is greater than zero}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-03,64,325!2025-02-11,70,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-07,67,310-->

## dynamic equilibrium

Whereas in {@{a static equilibrium all quantities have unchanging values}@}, in {@{a dynamic equilibrium various quantities may all be growing at the same rate, leaving their ratios unchanging}@}. For example, in {@{the [neoclassical growth model](Solow–Swan%20model.md)}@}, {@{the working population}@} is {@{growing at a rate which is exogenous (determined outside the model, by non-economic forces)}@}. In dynamic equilibrium, {@{output and the [physical capital](physical%20capital.md) stock}@} also {@{grow at that same rate}@}, with {@{[output](gross%20domestic%20product.md) per worker and the capital stock per worker unchanging}@}. Similarly, in {@{models of [inflation](inflation.md)}@} a dynamic equilibrium would involve {@{the [price level](price%20level.md), the nominal [money supply](money%20supply.md), nominal [wage rates](wage.md), and all other [nominal values](real%20and%20nominal%20value.md) growing at a single common rate}@}, while {@{all [real values](real%20and%20nominal%20value.md) are unchanging, as is the [inflation rate](inflation.md)}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-01-31,61,325!2025-01-11,42,290!2025-01-27,58,310!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-01-07,42,305!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-03,64,325!2025-02-13,72,325!2025-01-17,47,305!2025-02-15,74,325-->

The process of {@{comparing two dynamic equilibria to each other}@} is known as {@{__comparative dynamics__}@}. For example, in {@{the neoclassical growth model}@}, starting from {@{one dynamic equilibrium based in part on one particular saving rate}@}, {@{a permanent increase in the saving rate}@} leads to {@{a new dynamic equilibrium in which there are permanently higher capital per worker and productivity per worker}@}, but {@{an unchanged growth rate of output}@}; so it is said that {@{in this model}@} {@{the comparative dynamic effect of the saving rate on capital per worker is positive}@} but {@{the comparative dynamic effect of the saving rate on the output growth rate is zero}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-13,72,325!2025-01-27,58,310!2025-03-27,90,270!2025-02-13,72,325!2025-01-03,38,305!2025-01-02,38,305!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-10,69,325!2025-02-12,71,325!2025-02-15,74,325-->

## disequilibrium

- see: [disequilibrium macroeconomics § specific economic sectors](disequilibrium%20macroeconomics.md#specific%20economic%20sectors)

{@{__Disequilibrium__}@} characterizes {@{a market that is not in equilibrium}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> Disequilibrium can {@{occur extremely briefly or over an extended period of time}@}. At {@{the other extreme}@}, many economists view {@{[labor markets](labour%20economics.md) as being in a state of disequilibrium—specifically one of excess supply—over extended periods of time}@}. {@{Goods markets}@} are {@{somewhere in between}@}: prices of some goods, while {@{sluggish in adjusting due to [menu costs](menu%20cost.md), long-term contracts, and other impediments}@}, {@{do not stay at disequilibrium levels indefinitely}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-07,67,310!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-16,75,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-14,73,325!2025-01-26,57,310!2025-02-15,74,325!2025-02-08,68,325-->
