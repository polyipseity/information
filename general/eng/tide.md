# tide

__Tides__ are {@{the rise and fall of [sea levels](sea%20level.md)}@} caused by {@{the combined effects of the [gravitational](gravity.md) forces exerted by the [Moon](Moon.md) (and to a much lesser extent, the [Sun](Sun.md))}@} and are {@{also caused by the [Earth](Earth.md) and [Moon](Moon.md) [orbiting](orbit.md) one another}@}. <!--SR:!2028-11-26,1230,350!2028-06-08,1049,310!2025-08-23,17,348-->

## tidal constituents

### range variation: springs and neaps

- see: [tidal range](tidal%20range.md)

The semi-diurnal range ({@{the difference in height between high and low waters over about half a day}@}) varies in {@{a two-week cycle}@}. <!--SR:!2027-01-26,687,330!2025-08-23,304,330-->

Approximately {@{twice a month, around [new moon](new%20moon.md) and [full moon](full%20moon.md) when the [Sun](Sun.md), [Moon](Moon.md), and [Earth](Earth.md) form a line (a configuration known as a [syzygy](syzygy%20(astronomy.md).md))}@}, the [tidal force](tidal%20force.md) {@{due to the Sun reinforces that due to the Moon}@}. The tide's range is then {@{at its maximum; this is called the __spring tide__ or sometimes __syzygy tides__}@}. It is {@{not named after the [spring season](spring%20(season).md), but rather, like the season, derives from the meaning "jump, burst forth, rise", as in a natural [spring](spring%20(hydrology).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-05-31,790,330!2028-03-09,1028,350!2026-04-13,467,310!2027-03-10,717,330-->

When {@{the [Moon](Moon.md) is at first quarter or third quarter, the [Sun](Sun.md) and [Moon](Moon.md) are separated by 90° when viewed from the [Earth](Earth.md)}@}, and {@{the weaker solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's stronger tidal force}@}. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is {@{at its minimum; this is called the __neap tide__, __neaps__, or sometimes __quadrature tides__}@}. "Neap" is {@{an Anglo-Saxon word meaning "without the power", as in forðganges nip (forth-going without-the-power)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-11,721,330!2027-04-24,718,330!2025-12-26,351,290!2027-03-12,675,290-->

## physics

### equilibrium

The {@{__equilibrium tide__}@} is {@{the idealized tide assuming a landless Earth}@}. The ocean would {@{have a tidal bulge elongated towards the attracting body ([Moon](Moon.md) or [Sun](Sun.md))}@}. Note that it is _not_ {@{caused by the vertical pull or push nearest or farthest from the body, which is very weak compared to the opposing [gravity](gravity.md)}@}; rather, it is caused by {@{the tangential or [tractive](traction%20(mechanics).md) [tidal force](tidal%20force.md), strongest at about 45 degree from the body and does not need to oppose gravity}@}, resulting in {@{a horizontal tidal current}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-22,304,330!2026-11-09,637,330!2026-08-08,545,310!2027-12-30,974,350!2028-06-01,1092,350!2029-03-08,1315,350-->

The rotation of [Earth](Earth.md) {@{does not affect the equilibrium tide}@}. Therefore, each day {@{has about two tides}@}. However, it does {@{rotate the current tide eastward away from the equilibrium tide}@}, causing {@{the attracting body to pull the tide back to the equilibrium tide (or by [Newton's third law](Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md#third%20law) equivalently, the tide pulls the Moon ahead to orbit faster temporarily)}@}, which is responsible for {@{[tidal dissipation](#dissipation)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-05-27,789,330!2029-04-18,1348,350!2026-03-02,409,310!2027-03-16,734,330!2027-07-28,840,330-->

### dissipation

- see: [tidal acceleration](tidal%20acceleration.md)

Earth's tidal oscillations introduce dissipation at {@{an [average](average.md) rate of about 3.75 [terawatts](watt.md#terawatt)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-07,284,270-->
