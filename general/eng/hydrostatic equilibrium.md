# hydrostatic equilibrium

In [fluid mechanics](fluid%20mechanics.md), __hydrostatic equilibrium__ (__hydrostatic balance__, __hydrostasy__) is {@{the condition of a [fluid](fluid.md) or [plastic](plasticity%20(physics).md) [solid](solid.md) at rest}@}, which occurs when {@{external forces, such as [gravity](gravity.md), are balanced by a [pressure-gradient force](pressure-gradient%20force.md)}@}.
