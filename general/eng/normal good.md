> {@{__Example of a normal good:__}@} As {@{income increases from _B1_ to _B3_}@}, {@{the outward movement of utility curve _I_}@} dictates that {@{the quantity of good _X<sup>1</sup>_ increases in tandem}@}. Therefore, {@{_X<sup>1</sup>_ is a normal good}@}. Put another way, {@{the positively sloped income consumption curve}@} demonstrates that {@{_X<sup>1</sup>_ is normal}@}. {@{The [Engel curve](Engel%20curve.md) of _X<sup>1</sup>_}@} would {@{also be positively sloped}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-29,288,330!2025-10-18,255,330!2025-10-17,255,330!2025-10-20,256,330!2025-10-18,255,330!2028-08-27,1070,350!2025-12-06,294,330!2025-10-17,255,330!2028-08-17,1061,350!2027-10-23,765,330-->

In [economics](economics.md), a __normal good__ is {@{a type of a [good](goods.md) which experiences an increase in demand due to an increase in income}@}, unlike {@{[inferior goods](inferior%20good.md), for which the opposite is observed}@}. When {@{there is an increase in a person's income, for example due to a wage rise}@}, {@{a good for which the demand rises due to the wage increase}@}, is referred as a normal good. Conversely, {@{the demand for normal goods declines when the income decreases}@}, for example due to {@{a wage decrease or layoffs}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-24,1065,350!2028-11-27,1143,350!2025-11-17,278,330!2028-08-12,1057,350!2027-08-08,753,330!2025-11-25,285,330-->

## analysis

There is {@{a positive correlation between the income and demand for normal goods, that is, the changes income and demand for normal goods moves in the same direction}@}. That is to say, that normal goods have {@{an elastic relationship for the demand of a good with the income of the person consuming the good}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-15,758,330!2027-05-30,699,330-->

In economics, {@{the concept of elasticity, and specifically income elasticity of demand}@} is {@{key to explain the concept of normal goods}@}. Income elasticity of demand measures {@{the magnitude of the change in demand for a good in response to a change in consumer income}@}. The income elasticity of demand is calculated using the following formula, <p> {@{Income elasticity of demand= % change in quantity demanded / % change in consumer income}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-12,251,330!2025-11-25,285,330!2025-10-18,255,330!2028-09-26,1093,350-->

In mathematical terms, the formula can be written as follows:

{@{$\xi _{i}={\frac {\Delta Q_{/}Q}{\Delta Y/Y} }$}@}, where {@{$Q$ is the original quantity demanded and $Y$ is the original income, before any change}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-12,251,330!2027-11-01,770,330-->

A good is classified as a normal good when {@{the income elasticity of demand is greater than zero and has a value less than one}@} (annotation: If {@{normal goods include luxury goods}@}, then {@{the value does not need to be less than one}@}.). If {@{we look into a simple hypothetical example}@}, the demand for apples {@{increases by 10% for a 30% increase in income}@}, then {@{the income elasticity for apples would be 0.33 and hence apples are considered to be a normal good}@}. {@{Other types of goods like luxury and inferior goods}@} are also {@{classified using the income elasticity of demand}@}. The income elasticity of demand for luxury goods will have {@{a value of greater than one}@} and inferior goods will have {@{a value of less than one}@}. Luxury goods also have {@{a positive correlation of demand and income, but with luxury goods, a greater proportion of peoples income are spent on a luxury item}@}, for example, {@{a sports car}@}. On the other hand, with inferior or normal goods, {@{people spend a lesser proportion of their income}@}. Practically, {@{a higher income group of people spend more on luxury items}@} and {@{a lower income group of people spend more of their income on inferior or normal goods}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-02,266,330!2025-10-27,261,330!2025-10-22,258,330!2025-11-08,271,330!2025-10-17,255,330!2027-02-12,570,310!2025-11-30,289,330!2025-11-23,283,330!2025-10-17,255,330!2025-11-26,285,330!2025-11-27,286,330!2025-11-21,281,330!2025-10-25,260,330!2027-09-02,763,330!2025-10-28,263,330-->

However, {@{the classification of normal and luxury goods}@} {@{vary from person to person}@}. A good that is considered to be a normal good to a lot of people {@{maybe considered to be luxury good to someone}@}. This depends on {@{a lot of factors such as geographical locations, socio economic conditions in a country, local traditions and many more}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-02,290,330!2025-11-06,270,330!2025-11-28,287,330!2027-12-30,854,330-->

> The graph shows {@{the change in demand for both normal goods and luxury goods due to a change in income}@}. When {@{the income rises from 500 to 700}@}, {@{the quantity demanded for normal goods rises from 800 to 900}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,277,330!2025-11-07,271,330!2025-11-17,278,330!2025-11-01,266,330-->

### normal goods and consumer behaviour

The demand for normal goods are {@{determined by many types of [consumer behaviour](consumer%20behaviour.md)}@}. {@{A rise in income}@} leads to a change in consumer behaviour. When {@{income increases, consumers are able to afford goods that they could not consume before an income rise}@}. {@{The purchasing power of consumers}@} increases. In this situation, {@{the demand rises}@} because of {@{the attractiveness to consumers}@}. The goods are attractive to the consumers maybe because {@{they are high in quality and functionality and also the goods may help to maintain a certain socio economic prestige}@}. Individual consumers have {@{unique behavioural characteristics and they have their preferences accordingly}@}. <!--SR:!2028-09-04,1074,350!2025-10-29,263,330!2025-10-17,255,330!2025-12-01,290,330!2025-11-22,282,330!2025-10-23,259,330!2025-11-04,268,330!2027-06-10,639,310-->

According to {@{economic theory}@}, there must be {@{at least one normal good in any given bundle of goods \(i.e. not all goods can be inferior\)}@}. Economic theory {@{assumes that a [good](goods.md) always provides [marginal utility](marginal%20utility.md) \(holding everything else equal\)}@}. Therefore, if {@{consumption of all goods decrease when income increases}@}, {@{the resulting consumption combination would fall short of the new budget constraint frontier}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> This would {@{violate the economic rationality assumption}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-05,293,330!2025-12-03,291,330!2025-10-27,262,330!2025-11-09,272,330!2025-11-21,281,330!2025-11-30,289,330-->

When {@{the price of a normal good is zero}@}, {@{the demand is infinite}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-28,262,330!2028-08-25,1065,350-->

{@{A caveat to the table above}@} is that {@{not all goods are strictly normal or inferior across all income levels}@}. For example, {@{average used cars}@} could have {@{a positive income elasticity of demand at low income levels}@} – {@{extra income}@} could be funnelled into {@{replacing public transportation with self-commuting}@}. However, {@{the income elasticity of demand of average used cars}@} could {@{turn negative at higher income levels}@}, where the consumer may {@{elect to purchase new and/or luxury cars instead}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-18,279,330!2025-10-18,255,330!2027-10-31,770,330!2025-10-26,261,330!2025-11-19,280,330!2025-10-17,255,330!2025-10-16,23,370!2025-10-18,25,370!2025-10-17,24,370-->

Another potential caveat is brought up by {@{"The Notion of Inferior Good in the Public Economy"}@} by {@{Professor Jurion of [University of Liège](University%20of%20Liège.md)}@} \(published {@{1978}@}\). {@{[Public goods](public%20good%20(economics).md) such as online news}@} are often {@{considered inferior goods}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> However, {@{the conventional distinction between inferior and normal goods}@} may be {@{blurry for public goods}@}. \(At least, for {@{goods that are non-[rival](rivalry%20(economics).md) enough}@} that {@{they are conventionally understood as "public goods"}@}.\) {@{Consumption of many public goods will decrease}@} when {@{a rational consumer's income rises, due to replacement by private goods}@}, e.g. {@{building a private garden to replace use of public parks}@}. But when {@{effective congestion costs (costs due to many consumers using many of a normal good) to a consumer rises with the consumer's income}@}, even {@{a normal good with a low income elasticity of demand}@} \(independent of {@{the congestion costs associated with the non-[excludable](excludability.md) nature of the good}@}\) will {@{exhibit the same effect}@}. This makes it difficult to {@{distinguish inferior public goods from normal ones}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-10-17,1109,350!2026-08-17,472,310!2026-02-03,311,290!2025-12-04,292,330!2025-12-05,293,330!2025-11-18,279,330!2028-08-18,1063,350!2025-11-20,281,330!2025-11-03,267,330!2028-10-26,1117,350!2026-01-30,312,290!2027-11-27,790,330!2026-09-20,487,310!2027-08-22,755,330!2027-09-12,771,330!2025-11-13,276,330!2026-02-13,352,349-->
