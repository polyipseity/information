# retained earnings

The __retained earnings__ (also known as {@{__plowback__}@}<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup>) of a [corporation](corporation.md) is {@{the accumulated [net income](net%20income.md) of the corporation that is retained by the corporation at a particular point in time}@}, such as {@{at the end of the reporting period}@}. At the end of that period, {@{the net income (or net loss) at that point is transferred from the Profit and Loss Account to the retained earnings account}@}. If {@{the balance of the retained earnings account is negative it may be called __accumulated losses__, __retained losses__, __accumulated deficit__, or similar terminology}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-08,247,330!2025-09-17,280,330!2025-08-21,257,330!2027-08-17,808,330!2025-07-19,231,330-->

Any part of a credit balance in the account can be {@{capitalised, by the issue of [bonus shares](bonus%20share.md)}@}, and the balance is available for {@{distribution of [dividends](dividend.md) to [shareholders](shareholder.md), and the residue is carried forward into the next period}@}. {@{Some laws, including those of most states in the United States}@} require that {@{dividends be only paid out of the positive balance of the retained earnings account at the time that payment is to be made}@}. This {@{protects creditors from a company being liquidated through dividends}@}. {@{A few states}@}, however, allow {@{payment of dividends to continue to increase a corporation’s accumulated deficit}@}. This is known as {@{a liquidating dividend or liquidating cash dividend}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2027-05-28,744,330!2027-07-14,783,330!2025-08-13,251,330!2027-09-22,823,330!2028-04-13,1007,350!2025-10-13,299,330!2025-08-09,248,330!2025-07-31,241,330-->

In [accounting](accounting.md), the retained earnings at the end of one accounting period are {@{the opening retained earnings in the next period}@}, to which is {@{added the net income or net loss (including taxes) for that period}@} and from which is {@{deducted the bonus shares issued in the financial period (usually a year) and dividends paid in that period (so net income or loss excludes bonus shares and dividends)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-20,256,330!2025-09-16,279,330!2025-11-27,289,290-->

If {@{a company is publicly held}@}, the balance of retained earnings account that is negatively referred to as "accumulated deficit" may {@{appear in the Accountant's Opinion in what is called the "Ongoing Concern" statement}@} located at {@{the end of required SEC financial reporting at the end of each quarter}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-01,288,330!2026-10-24,559,310!2026-10-19,580,330-->

Retained earnings are {@{reported in the [shareholders' equity](equity%20(finance).md) section of the corporation's [balance sheet](balance%20sheet.md)}@}. Corporations with net accumulated losses may {@{refer to negative shareholders' equity as positive _shareholders' deficit_}@}. A report of the movements in retained earnings is presented along with {@{[other comprehensive income](accumulated%20other%20comprehensive%20income.md) and changes in [share capital](share%20capital.md) in the [statement of changes in equity](statement%20of%20changes%20in%20equity.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-02-15,669,330!2026-04-12,421,310!2027-02-07,626,290-->

Due to {@{the nature of [double-entry](double-entry%20bookkeeping.md) [accrual accounting](accrual.md)}@}, retained earnings {@{do not represent surplus cash available to a company}@}. Rather, they represent {@{how the company has managed its profits (i.e. whether it has distributed them as dividends or reinvested them in the business)}@}. When reinvested, those retained earnings are {@{reflected as increases in assets (which could include cash) or reductions to liabilities on the balance sheet}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-29,807,330!2025-08-26,260,330!2028-04-21,1015,350!2025-11-07,261,270-->

## stockholders' equity

When {@{total assets are greater than total liabilities}@}, stockholders have {@{a positive equity (positive [book value](book%20value.md))}@}. Conversely, when {@{total liabilities are greater than total assets, stockholders have a negative stockholders' equity (negative book value) — also sometimes called stockholders' deficit}@}. A stockholders' deficit does not mean that {@{stockholders owe money to the corporation as they own only its net assets and are not accountable for its [liabilities](liability%20(financial%20accounting).md)}@}, though {@{it is one of the definitions of [insolvency](insolvency.md)}@}. This means that {@{the value of the assets of the company must rise above its liabilities}@} before the stockholders hold positive equity value in the company. <!--SR:!2025-09-22,282,330!2027-08-18,809,330!2027-09-12,828,330!2026-06-05,461,310!2027-09-23,834,330!2025-08-17,255,330-->

- retained earnings equation ::@:: retained earnings = opening retained earnings + current year net profit from p&l a/c - dividends paid in the current year <!--SR:!2025-12-18,302,290!2025-10-17,302,330-->

## tax implications

A company is normally subject to {@{a company tax on the net income of the company in a financial year}@}. The amount added to retained earnings is {@{generally the after tax net income}@}. In {@{most cases in most jurisdictions}@} {@{no tax is payable on the accumulated earnings retained by a company}@}. However, this {@{creates a potential for [tax avoidance](tax%20avoidance.md)}@}, because {@{the corporate tax rate is usually lower than the higher marginal rates for some individual taxpayers}@}. Higher income taxpayers could {@{"park" income inside a private company instead of being paid out as a dividend and then taxed at the individual rates}@}. To {@{remove this tax benefit}@}, some jurisdictions {@{impose an "[undistributed profits tax](undistributed%20profits%20tax.md)" on retained earnings of private companies, usually at the highest individual marginal tax rate}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-08,483,310!2027-07-17,729,290!2025-09-09,272,330!2028-02-24,972,350!2028-02-22,971,350!2027-09-30,841,330!2027-11-12,877,330!2025-08-02,242,330!2027-12-03,891,330-->

{@{The issue of [bonus shares](bonus%20share.md), even if funded out of retained earnings}@}, will in {@{most jurisdictions}@} {@{not be treated as a dividend distribution and not taxed in the hands of the shareholder}@}. <!--SR:!2027-02-13,669,330!2027-05-10,732,330!2025-07-20,215,290-->

Retaining earnings by a company {@{increases the company's shareholder equity, which increases the value of each shareholder's shareholding}@}. This {@{increases the share price, which may result in a [capital gains tax](capital%20gains%20tax.md) liability when the shares are disposed of}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-03,268,330!2025-09-03,219,270-->

The decision of {@{whether a corporation should retain net income or have it paid out as dividends}@} depends on several factors including, but not limited to: <!--SR:!2025-08-03,243,330-->

- [Tax treatment of dividends](dividend%20tax.md), and
- Funds required for reinvestment in the corporation (called retention).

A number of factors affect the decision of {@{the amount of profit that a corporation should retain}@}, including: <!--SR:!2027-05-26,742,330-->

- Quantum of net profit
- Age of the business enterprise
- Dividend policy of the corporation
- Future plan regarding modernization and expansion
