# London dispersion force

__London dispersion forces__ (__LDF__) are {@{[intermolecular forces](intermolecular%20force.md) between non-[polar](chemical%20polarity.md) [atoms](atom.md) and [molecules](molecule.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-14,898,310-->

They are stronger if {@{the [polarizability](polarizability.md) of the molecules are higher, which is increased by larger molecular sizes and having molecular shapes with greater surface areas}@}. <!--SR:!2026-12-27,743,230-->
