# strain

In [mechanics](mechanics.md), __strain__ is defined as {@{relative [deformation](deformation%20(physics).md)}@}.

## strain measures

### engineering strain

__Engineering strain__, also known as {@{__Cauchy strain__}@}, is expressed as {@{the ratio of the deformation to the initial dimension on the body}@}. For an {@{axial object}@}, this is {@{the _relative elongation_ (symbol: $e$ or $\varepsilon$) or the change in length $\Delta L$ per unit length of the original length $L$}@}: {@{$$e = \frac {\Delta L} L$$}@}.

Strain has {@{no units and is dimensionless}@}.
