# mass

Mass is {@{an [intrinsic property](intrinsic%20and%20extrinsic%20properties.md) of a [body](physical%20object.md)}@}. It was traditionally believed to be {@{related to the [quantity](physical%20quantity.md) of [matter](matter.md) in a body}@}, until {@{the discovery of the [atom](atom.md) and [particle physics](particle%20physics.md)}@}. It was found that {@{different atoms and different [elementary particles](elementary%20particle.md), theoretically with the same amount of matter, have nonetheless different masses}@}. Mass in [modern physics](modern%20physics.md) has {@{[multiple definitions](mass%20in%20special%20relativity.md) which are conceptually distinct, but physically equivalent}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-02,1147,350!2026-03-23,405,290!2029-01-02,1266,350!2026-02-28,442,310!2028-08-06,1152,350-->
