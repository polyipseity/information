# mass

Mass is {@{an [intrinsic property](intrinsic%20and%20extrinsic%20properties.md) of a [body](physical%20object.md)}@}. It was traditionally believed to be {@{related to the [quantity](physical%20quantity.md) of [matter](matter.md) in a body}@}, until {@{the discovery of the [atom](atom.md) and [particle physics](particle%20physics.md)}@}. It was found that {@{different atoms and different [elementary particles](elementary%20particle.md), theoretically with the same amount of matter, have nonetheless different masses}@}. Mass in [modern physics](modern%20physics.md) has {@{[multiple definitions](mass%20in%20special%20relativity.md) which are conceptually distinct, but physically equivalent}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-12,252,330!2025-02-11,142,290!2025-07-15,278,330!2026-02-28,442,310!2025-06-11,252,330-->
