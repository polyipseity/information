# rigid frame

## description

In a rigid frame, structural elements like {@{beams, columns, and floor slabs are rigidly connected}@}. Typically, the material used is {@{reinforced concrete}@}. At {@{junctions joining the structural elements}@}, the joints are {@{fixed and rigid}@}.

Usually, the building plan is {@{open and are rectangular grids, making space planning easy}@}. Even {@{the vertical plan (elevation)}@} are {@{rectangular grids}@}. You can think of the structural elements as {@{a 3D lattice}@}, where the vertical structural elements are the {@{columns or walls}@} and others are the {@{beams}@}.

It is used in {@{car parks, low-rise factories, etc.}@} Economically, it makes sense {@{up to about 25 stories}@}, after which {@{the lateral stiffness is too low, making it not suitable for tall buildings}@}.

It can be combined with {@{[shear walls](shear%20wall.md), constrained to deflect together}@}. This provides {@{stiffer structure than rigid frame or shear walls alone}@}. It is economic up to {@{about 50 stories}@}.
