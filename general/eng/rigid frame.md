# rigid frame

## description

In a rigid frame, structural elements like {@{beams, columns, and floor slabs are rigidly connected}@}. Typically, the material used is {@{reinforced concrete}@}. At {@{junctions joining the structural elements}@}, the joints are {@{fixed and rigid}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-28,901,330!2026-01-12,333,270!2028-09-07,1224,350!2028-12-19,1304,350-->

Usually, the building plan is {@{open and are rectangular grids, making space planning easy}@}. Even {@{the vertical plan (elevation)}@} are {@{rectangular grids}@}. You can think of the structural elements as {@{a 3D lattice}@}, where the vertical structural elements are the {@{columns or walls}@} and others are the {@{beams}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-13,508,310!2028-11-05,1268,350!2026-07-12,578,310!2028-04-07,1104,350!2027-03-18,788,330!2028-02-12,1062,350-->

It is used in {@{car parks, low-rise factories, etc.}@} Economically, it makes sense {@{up to about 25 stories}@}, after which {@{the lateral stiffness is too low, making it not suitable for tall buildings}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-22,896,330!2027-06-09,841,330!2027-05-19,837,330-->

It can be combined with {@{[shear walls](shear%20wall.md), constrained to deflect together}@}. This provides {@{stiffer structure than rigid frame or shear walls alone}@}. It is economic up to {@{about 50 stories}@}. <!--SR:!2026-10-11,670,330!2027-05-30,795,330!2028-09-23,1178,330-->
