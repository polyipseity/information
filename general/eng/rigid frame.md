# rigid frame

## description

In a rigid frame, structural elements like {@{beams, columns, and floor slabs are rigidly connected}@}. Typically, the material used is {@{reinforced concrete}@}. At {@{junctions joining the structural elements}@}, the joints are {@{fixed and rigid}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-10,210,310!2025-02-13,121,270!2025-05-01,269,330!2025-05-25,286,330-->

Usually, the building plan is {@{open and are rectangular grids, making space planning easy}@}. Even {@{the vertical plan (elevation)}@} are {@{rectangular grids}@}. You can think of the structural elements as {@{a 3D lattice}@}, where the vertical structural elements are the {@{columns or walls}@} and others are the {@{beams}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-13,508,310!2025-05-15,280,330!2026-07-12,578,310!2025-03-30,244,330!2025-01-19,184,310!2025-03-17,233,330-->

It is used in {@{car parks, low-rise factories, etc.}@} Economically, it makes sense {@{up to about 25 stories}@}, after which {@{the lateral stiffness is too low, making it not suitable for tall buildings}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-09,209,310!2025-02-18,196,310!2025-02-01,195,310-->

It can be combined with {@{[shear walls](shear%20wall.md), constrained to deflect together}@}. This provides {@{stiffer structure than rigid frame or shear walls alone}@}. It is economic up to {@{about 50 stories}@}. <!--SR:!2026-10-11,670,330!2025-03-26,241,330!2025-07-03,273,310-->
