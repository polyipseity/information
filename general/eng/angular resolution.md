# angular resolution

{@{The colloquial use of the term "resolution"}@} sometimes {@{causes confusion}@}; when {@{an optical system}@} is said to {@{have a high resolution or high angular resolution}@}, it means that {@{the perceived distance, or actual angular distance, between resolved neighboring objects is small}@}. {@{The value that quantifies this property, _θ_}@}, which is given by {@{the [Rayleigh criterion](#Rayleigh's%20criterion)}@}, is {@{low for a system with a high resolution}@}.

## Rayleigh's criterion

The {@{Rayleigh}@}'s criterion is that {@{two point sources are considered just resolved when the principal diffraction maximum of the [Airy disk](Airy%20disk.md) of an image coincide with the first minimum of the [Airy disk](Airy%20disk.md) of the other}@}.

According to the criterion, diffraction through a circular [aperture](aperture.md) gives:

> diffraction {@{through a circular [aperture](aperture.md)}@}
>
> - {@{$\theta \approx \sin \theta = 1.22 \frac \lambda D \quad\mathrm{(considering\ that\ \sin \theta \approx \theta)}$}@}
>
> where {@{_θ_ is _angular resolution_ in [radians](radian.md), _λ_ is the [wavelength](wavelength.md), and _D_ is the [diameter](diameter.md) of the [aperture](aperture.md)}@}.
