# quasar

A __quasar__ (/ˈkweɪzɑːr/ _KWAY-zar_) is {@{an extremely [luminous](luminosity.md) [active galactic nucleus](active%20galactic%20nucleus.md) (AGN)}@}. It is sometimes known as {@{a __quasi-stellar object__, abbreviated __QSO__}@}. The emission from an AGN is powered by {@{a [supermassive black hole](supermassive%20black%20hole.md) with a mass ranging from millions to tens of billions of [solar masses](solar%20mass.md), surrounded by a gaseous [accretion disc](accretion%20disk.md)}@}. Gas in the disc {@{falling towards the black hole heats up and releases [energy](energy.md) in the form of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md)}@}. The [radiant energy](radiant%20energy.md) of quasars is {@{enormous}@}; the most powerful quasars have {@{[luminosities](luminosity.md) thousands of times greater than that of a [galaxy](galaxy.md) such as the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md)}@}. Quasars are usually categorized as {@{a subclass of the more general category of AGN}@}. The [redshifts](redshift.md) of quasars are {@{of [cosmological origin](expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md)}@}.

Quasar discovery surveys have shown that {@{quasar activity was more common in the distant past; the peak epoch was approximately 10 billion years ago}@}. Concentrations of multiple quasars are known as {@{[large quasar groups](large%20quasar%20group.md)}@} and may {@{constitute some of the [largest known structures](galaxy%20filament.md) in the universe if the observed groups are good tracers of mass distribution}@}.
