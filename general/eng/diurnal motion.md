# diurnal motion

{@{__Diurnal motion__}@} (from [Latin](Latin.md) _diurnus_ 'daily', from [Latin](Latin.md) _diÄ“s_ 'day') is {@{an [astronomical](astronomy.md) term referring to the apparent [motion](motion.md) of [celestial objects](astronomical%20object.md) (e.g. the [Sun](Sun.md) and [stars](star.md)) around [Earth](Earth.md), or more precisely around the two [celestial poles](celestial%20pole.md), over the course of one day}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-06,168,317!2025-06-04,223,277-->

## relative motion

The relative motion of diurnal motion depends {@{on the [latitude](latitude.md) but not the [longitude](longitude.md)}@}. The latter only affects {@{the time we see the [stars](star.md)}@}. Stars that {@{do not set below the [horizon](horizon.md)}@} are called {@{[circumpolar stars](circumpolar%20star.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-10,266,337!2025-06-21,275,337!2025-06-10,268,337!2026-02-07,395,297-->

From {@{the [Northern celestial sphere](Northern%20celestial%20sphere.md)}@}, the [stars](star.md) moves {@{[counterclockwise](clockwise.md) around [Polaris](Polaris.md), the North [pole star](pole%20star.md)}@}. At the [North Pole](North%20Pole.md), all the [stars](star.md) can also be described as {@{moving right as Polaris is around the [zenith](zenith.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-13,382,297!2026-02-26,406,297!2026-01-01,397,297-->

From {@{the [Southern celestial sphere](Southern%20celestial%20sphere.md)}@}, the [stars](star.md) moves {@{[clockwise](clockwise.md) around [Sigma Octantis](Sigma%20Octantis.md), sometimes called the South [pole star](pole%20star.md)}@}. At the [South Pole](South%20Pole.md), all the [stars](star.md) can also be described as {@{moving left as Sigma Octantis is around the [zenith](zenith.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-06,148,297!2025-04-29,193,270!2025-02-08,152,297-->

From {@{anywhere on the [equator](equator.md)}@}, the two [celestial poles](celestial%20pole.md) are {@{on the horizon due [north](north.md) and [south](south.md), and appears fixed}@}. The [stars](star.md) moves {@{[westward](west.md), vertically from and into the [horizon](horizon.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-22,578,337!2025-06-09,244,290!2026-02-10,437,317-->

For anywhere {@{in between the [equator](equator.md) and the [celestial poles](celestial%20pole.md)}@}, the motion is {@{tilted}@} and can be {@{interpolated from the above description using the current location's [latitude](latitude.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-28,255,330!2026-10-12,635,330!2025-05-07,221,310-->
