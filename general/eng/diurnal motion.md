# diurnal motion

{@{__Diurnal motion__}@} (from [Latin](Latin.md) _diurnus_ 'daily', from [Latin](Latin.md) _diÄ“s_ 'day') is {@{an [astronomical](astronomy.md) term referring to the apparent [motion](motion.md) of [celestial objects](astronomical%20object.md) (e.g. the [Sun](Sun.md) and [stars](star.md)) around [Earth](Earth.md), or more precisely around the two [celestial poles](celestial%20pole.md), over the course of one day}@}.

## relative motion

The relative motion of diurnal motion depends {@{on the [latitude](latitude.md) but not the [longitude](longitude.md)}@}. The latter only affects {@{the time we see the [stars](star.md)}@}. Stars that {@{do not set below the [horizon](horizon.md)}@} are called {@{[circumpolar stars](circumpolar%20star.md)}@}.

From {@{the [Northern celestial sphere](Northern%20celestial%20sphere.md)}@}, the [stars](star.md) moves {@{[counterclockwise](clockwise.md) around [Polaris](Polaris.md), the North [pole star](pole%20star.md)}@}. At the [North Pole](North%20Pole.md), all the [stars](star.md) can also be described as {@{moving right as Polaris is around the [zenith](zenith.md)}@}.

From {@{the [Southern celestial sphere](Southern%20celestial%20sphere.md)}@}, the [stars](star.md) moves {@{[clockwise](clockwise.md) around [Sigma Octantis](Sigma%20Octantis.md), sometimes called the South [pole star](pole%20star.md)}@}. At the [South Pole](South%20Pole.md), all the [stars](star.md) can also be described as {@{moving left as Sigma Octantis is around the [zenith](zenith.md)}@}.

From {@{anywhere on the [equator](equator.md)}@}, the two [celestial poles](celestial%20pole.md) are {@{on the horizon due [north](north.md) and [south](south.md), and appears fixed}@}. The [stars](star.md) moves {@{[westward](west.md), vertically from and into the [horizon](horizon.md)}@}.

For anywhere {@{in between the [equator](equator.md) and the [celestial poles](celestial%20pole.md)}@}, the motion is {@{tilted}@} and can be {@{interpolated from the above description using the current location's [latitude](latitude.md)}@}.
