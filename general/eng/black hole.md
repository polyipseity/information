# black hole

A __black hole__ is {@{a region of [spacetime](spacetime.md) where [gravity](gravity.md) is so strong that nothing, not even [light](light.md) and other [electromagnetic waves](electromagnetic%20radiation.md), is capable of possessing enough energy to escape it}@}. [Einstein](Albert%20Einstein.md)'s {@{theory of [general relativity](general%20relativity.md)}@} predicts that {@{a sufficiently compact [mass](mass.md) can deform spacetime to form a black hole}@}. {@{The [boundary](boundary%20(topology).md) of no escape}@} is called {@{the [event horizon](event%20horizon.md)}@}. A black hole has {@{a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it}@}, but it has {@{no locally detectable features according to general relativity}@}. In many ways, a black hole acts like {@{an ideal [black body](black%20body.md), as it reflects no light}@}. {@{[Quantum field theory in curved spacetime](quantum%20field%20theory%20in%20curved%20spacetime.md)}@} predicts that {@{event horizons emit [Hawking radiation](hawking%20radiation.md), with [the same spectrum](thermal%20radiation.md) as a black body of a [temperature](temperature.md) inversely proportional to its mass}@}. This temperature is {@{of the order of billionths of a [kelvin](Kelvin.md) for [stellar black holes](stellar%20black%20hole.md), making it essentially impossible to observe directly}@}. <!--SR:!2027-06-19,790,330!2029-06-30,1394,350!2025-11-20,320,290!2027-05-08,764,330!2026-10-07,601,330!2028-08-26,1153,350!2027-03-06,707,330!2026-03-02,427,310!2025-12-18,331,290!2026-09-17,536,310!2027-08-21,849,330-->
