## objective

The framework has {@{7 _interdependent_ elements}@}, of which {@{3 are _hard elements_ and 4 are _soft elements_}@}. Hard elements {@{might be easier to define than soft elements but they are equally important}@}. The most important element is {@{shared values}@}.

The 3 hard elements are {@{_strategy_, _structure_, and _systems_}@}.

- _strategy_ ::@:: actions intended to enhance competitive advantage
- _structure_ ::@:: coordination and integration mechanisms, and division of activities
- _systems_ ::@:: formal and informal procedures for allocation, measurement, and reward

The 4 soft elements are {@{_shared values_, _skills_, _staff_, and _style_}@}.

- _shared values_ ::@:: core beliefs and values forming the corporate culture
- _skills_ ::@:: core competencies and distinctive capabilities, such as existing skills, skill development
- _staff_ ::@:: hiring and firing standards or policies, and staff characteristics
- _style_ ::@:: behavior patterns of key groups, such as management style
