# solar eclipse

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../../tools/utility.py.md
```

A __solar eclipse__ occurs when {@{the [Moon](Moon.md) passes between [Earth](Earth.md) and the [Sun](Sun.md), thereby obscuring the view of the Sun from a small part of Earth, totally or partially}@}. Such an alignment occurs {@{approximately every six months, during the [eclipse season](eclipsee%20season.md) in its [new moon](new%20moon.md) phase}@}, when {@{the Moon is closest to the plane of [Earth's orbit](Earth's%20orbit.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-04,131,290!2025-06-05,254,330!2025-05-29,248,330-->

## types

The [Sun](Sun.md)'s distance from [Earth](Earth.md) is {@{about 400 times the [Moon](Moon.md)'s [distance](lunar%20distance.md), and the Sun's [diameter](diameter.md) is also about 400 times the Moon's [diameter](diameter.md)}@}. Because these ratios are approximately the same, {@{the Sun and the Moon as seen from Earth appear to be approximately the same size: about 0.5 [degree of arc](degree%20(angle).md) in [angular measure](angular%20diameter.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-08,209,310!2024-12-29,127,290-->

The [Moon](Moon.md)'s orbit around [Earth](Earth.md) is {@{slightly [elliptical](elliptic%20orbit.md), as is Earth's orbit around the [Sun](Sun.md)}@}. The [apparent sizes](angular%20diameter.md) of the Sun and Moon therefore {@{vary}@}. The [magnitude of an eclipse](magnitude%20of%20eclipse.md) is {@{the ratio of the apparent size of the Moon to the apparent size of the Sun during an eclipse}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,182,310!2025-05-01,211,310!2025-01-01,132,310-->

There are {@{three main types of solar eclipses: [total eclipse](#total%20eclipse), [annular eclipse](#annular%20eclipse), and [partial eclipse](#partial%20eclipse)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-27,151,310-->

### total eclipse

A total eclipse occurs on average {@{every 18 months}@} when {@{the dark silhouette of the [Moon](Moon.md) completely obscures the bright light of the [Sun](Sun.md)}@}, allowing {@{the much fainter [solar corona](stellar%20corona.md) to be visible}@}. During an eclipse, totality occurs {@{only along a narrow track on the surface of Earth. This narrow track is called the path of totality}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-25,135,290!2024-12-26,105,250!2025-03-14,173,310!2025-03-07,172,310-->

### annular eclipse

An annular eclipse, like a total eclipse, occurs when {@{the [Sun](Sun.md) and [Moon](Moon.md) are exactly in line with [Earth](Earth.md)}@}. During an annular eclipse, however, {@{the [apparent size](angular%20diameter.md) of the Moon is not large enough to completely block out the Sun}@}. Totality thus {@{does not occur; the Sun instead appears as a very bright ring, or [annulus](annulus%20(mathematics).md), surrounding the dark disk of the Moon}@}. Annular eclipses occur {@{once every one or two years, not annually}@}. Their name comes from {@{the [Latin](Latin.md) [root word](root%20(linguistics).md) _anulus_, meaning "ring", rather than _annus_, for "year"}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-11,138,310!2025-05-03,231,330!2025-04-24,222,330!2025-02-05,160,310!2025-06-13,229,290-->

### partial eclipse

A partial eclipse occurs {@{about twice a year}@}, when {@{the [Sun](Sun.md) and [Moon](Moon.md) are not exactly in line with [Earth](Earth.md)}@} and {@{the Moon only partially obscures the Sun}@}. This phenomenon can usually be seen from {@{a large part of Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse}@}. However, some eclipses can be seen {@{only as a partial eclipse}@}, because {@{the [umbra](umbra,%20penumbra%20and%20antumbra.md#umbra) passes above [Earth's polar regions](polar%20regions%20of%20Earth.md) and never intersects [Earth's surface](geoid.md)}@}. Partial eclipses are {@{virtually unnoticeable in terms of the Sun's brightness}@}, as {@{it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all}@}. Even at 99%, it would be {@{no darker than [civil twilight](twilight.md#civil%20twilight)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-24,151,310!2025-02-25,163,310!2025-04-28,226,330!2025-05-14,239,330!2025-11-16,358,290!2025-03-19,178,310!2026-01-17,411,310!2025-02-12,160,310!2025-07-05,278,330-->

## terminology

### eclipse phases

During {@{a [total eclipse](#total%20eclipse)}@}, there are {@{4 visual phases (excluding totality)}@}, which are called: <!--SR:!2025-04-27,225,330!2025-07-19,289,330-->

## predictions

### path

During a central eclipse, the [Moon](Moon.md)'s {@{[umbra](umbra,%20penumbra%20and%20antumbra.md#umbra) (or [antumbra](umbra,%20penumbra%20and%20antumbra.md#antumbra), in the case of an [annular eclipse](#annular%20eclipse)) moves rapidly from [west](west.md) to [east](east.md) across [Earth](Earth.md)}@}. Earth is also {@{[rotating](rotation.md) from west to east, at about 28 km/min at the [equator](equator.md)}@}, but as the Moon is {@{moving in the same direction as Earth's rotation at about 61 km/min}@}, the umbra almost always appears to {@{move in a roughly west–east direction across a map of Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus Earth's rotational velocity}@}. This also means standing on a location on Earth, the [Sun](Sun.md) {@{appears to enter the [Moon](Moon.md) from the east}@}, as {@{the [Moon](Moon.md) moves westward in the sky slower than the [Sun](Sun.md) due to the Moon's orbital velocity}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-05,182,310!2025-01-07,89,250!2025-03-03,156,270!2025-01-05,128,290!2025-08-06,263,290!2025-05-22,219,290-->
