# factors of production

In [economics](economics.md), __factors of production__, __resources__, or __inputs__ are {@{what is used in the production process to produce [output](output%20(economics).md)}@}—that is, {@{[goods](goods.md) and [services](service%20(economics).md)}@}. The utilized amounts of the various inputs determine {@{the quantity of output according to the relationship called the [production function](production%20function.md)}@}. There are {@{four _basic_ [resources](resource.md) or factors of production: land, labour, capital and entrepreneur (or enterprise)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> The factors are also frequently labeled {@{"__producer goods or services__"}@} to {@{distinguish them from the goods or services purchased by consumers, which are frequently labeled "[consumer goods](final%20good.md)"}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-08-25,255,330!2025-08-12,245,330!2028-01-11,905,330!2028-01-05,908,330!2025-08-22,252,330!2028-01-19,922,330-->

There are {@{two types of factors: _primary_ and _secondary_}@}. {@{The previously mentioned primary factors}@} are {@{land, labour and capital}@}. {@{Materials and energy}@} are {@{considered secondary factors in [classical economics](classical%20economics.md)}@} because {@{they are obtained from land, labour, and capital}@}. The primary factors {@{facilitate production}@} but {@{neither become part of the product (as with [raw materials](raw%20material.md)) nor become significantly transformed by the [production process](industrial%20processes.md) (as with fuel used to power machinery)}@}. Land includes {@{not only the site of production but also [natural resources](natural%20resource.md) above or below the [soil](soil.md)}@}. Recent usage has distinguished {@{[human capital](human%20capital.md) (the stock of knowledge in the [labor force](workforce.md)) from labour}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> {@{Entrepreneurship}@} is {@{also sometimes considered a factor of production}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> Sometimes {@{the overall state of [technology](technology.md)}@} is {@{described as a factor of production}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> {@{The number and definition of factors}@} vary, depending on {@{theoretical purpose, empirical emphasis, or [school of economics](schools%20of%20economic%20thought.md)}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-09-17,273,330!2025-09-16,272,330!2028-01-17,910,330!2025-09-21,277,330!2025-08-05,221,310!2028-01-12,915,330!2028-01-26,918,330!2025-09-22,278,330!2027-05-16,729,330!2026-01-06,317,290!2025-08-10,243,330!2025-08-13,246,330!2025-08-09,225,310!2025-11-07,315,330!2027-07-11,759,330!2025-08-09,242,330-->
