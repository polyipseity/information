In {@{[automata theory](automata%20theory.md)}@}, {@{__sequential logic__}@} is {@{a type of [logic circuit](logic%20circuit.md) whose output depends on the present value of its input signals and on the [sequence](sequence.md) of past inputs, the input history}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup><sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> This is in contrast to {@{_[combinational logic](combinational%20logic.md)_}@}, whose {@{output is a function of only the present input}@}.

Sequential logic is used to {@{construct [finite-state machines](finite-state%20machine.md)}@}, {@{a basic building block in all digital circuitry}@}. {@{Virtually all circuits in practical digital devices}@} are {@{a mixture of combinational and sequential logic}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-22,276,330!2026-03-02,284,330!2026-03-12,294,330!2026-01-30,267,330-->

{@{A familiar example of a device with sequential logic}@} is {@{a [television set](television%20set.md) with "channel up" and "channel down" buttons}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {@{Pressing the "up" button}@} gives {@{the television an input telling it to switch to the next channel above the one it is currently receiving}@}.

{@{Digital sequential logic circuits}@} are divided into {@{[synchronous](synchronous%20logic.md) and [asynchronous](asynchronous%20logic.md#asynchronous%20logic) types}@}. In {@{synchronous sequential circuits}@}, the state of the device {@{changes only at discrete times in response to a [clock signal](clock%20signal.md)}@}. In {@{asynchronous circuits the state of the device can change at any time in response to changing inputs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-26,280,330!2026-03-12,294,330!2026-02-28,282,330!2026-03-12,294,330!2026-03-08,290,330-->

## synchronous sequential logic

{@{Nearly all sequential logic today}@} is {@{_clocked_ or _synchronous_ logic}@}. In {@{a synchronous circuit}@}, {@{an [electronic oscillator](electronic%20oscillator.md) called a _clock_ \(or [clock generator](clock%20generator.md)\)}@} {@{generates a sequence of repetitive pulses called the _[clock signal](clock%20signal.md)_ which is distributed to all the memory elements in the circuit}@}. {@{The basic memory element in synchronous logic}@} is {@{the [flip-flop](flip-flop%20(electronics).md)}@}. {@{The output of each flip-flop}@} {@{only changes when triggered by the clock pulse}@}, so {@{changes to the logic signals throughout the circuit all begin at the same time}@}, at {@{regular intervals, synchronized by the clock}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-21,259,330!2026-02-18,272,330!2026-03-08,290,330!2026-02-21,275,330!2026-01-16,254,330!2026-03-08,290,330!2026-03-12,294,330!2026-02-22,276,330!2026-02-22,276,330!2026-01-25,263,330!2026-02-25,279,330-->

{@{The output of all the storage elements \(flip-flops\) in the circuit at any given time, the binary data they contain}@}, is called the {@{_[state](state%20(computer%20science).md)_ of the circuit}@}. {@{The state of the synchronous circuit}@} {@{only changes on clock pulses}@}. At each cycle, the next state is {@{determined by the current state and the value of the input signals when the clock pulse occurs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-21,259,330!2026-01-25,263,330!2026-02-24,278,330!2026-01-19,257,330!2025-12-18,231,330-->

{@{The main advantage of synchronous logic}@} is {@{its simplicity}@}. {@{The logic gates which perform the operations on the data}@} require {@{a finite amount of time to respond to changes to their inputs}@}. This is called {@{_[propagation delay](propagation%20delay.md)_}@}. {@{The interval between clock pulses must be long enough}@} so that {@{all the logic gates have time to respond to the changes and their outputs "settle" to stable logic values before the next clock pulse occurs}@}. As long as {@{this condition is met \(ignoring certain other details\)}@} the circuit is {@{guaranteed to be stable and reliable}@}. This determines {@{the maximum operating speed of the synchronous circuit}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-17,255,330!2026-02-21,275,330!2026-03-12,294,330!2026-02-21,275,330!2027-10-19,731,330!2026-02-23,277,330!2026-01-20,258,330!2026-03-12,294,330!2026-02-22,276,330!2026-02-22,276,330-->

Synchronous logic has two main disadvantages:

- {@{The maximum possible clock rate}@} is determined by {@{the slowest logic path in the circuit}@}, otherwise known as {@{the critical path}@}. {@{Every logical calculation, from the simplest to the most complex}@}, must {@{complete in one clock cycle}@}. So {@{logic paths that complete their calculations quickly}@} are {@{idle much of the time, waiting for the next clock pulse}@}. Therefore, synchronous logic {@{can be slower than asynchronous logic}@}. {@{One way to speed up synchronous circuits}@} is to {@{split complex operations into several simple operations which can be performed in successive clock cycles}@}, a technique known as {@{_[pipelining](pipeline%20(computing).md)_}@}. This technique is extensively {@{used in [microprocessor](microprocessor.md) design and helps to improve the performance of modern processors}@}.
- {@{The clock signal}@} must be {@{distributed to every flip-flop in the circuit}@}. As {@{the clock is usually a high-frequency signal}@}, this distribution {@{consumes a relatively large amount of power and dissipates much heat}@}. Even {@{the flip-flops that are doing nothing consume a small amount of power}@}, thereby {@{generating [waste heat](waste%20heat.md) in the chip}@}. In {@{battery-powered devices}@}, {@{additional hardware and software complexity}@} is required to {@{reduce the clock speed or temporarily turn off the clock while the device is not being actively used}@}, in order to {@{maintain a usable battery life}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-12,294,330!2028-10-14,1035,350!2026-01-13,251,330!2026-02-17,271,330!2026-03-12,294,330!2026-03-02,284,330!2026-02-12,266,330!2026-01-16,254,330!2026-03-03,285,330!2026-01-28,265,330!2026-01-24,262,330!2026-01-21,259,330!2026-03-01,283,330!2026-01-17,255,330!2026-03-01,283,330!2026-02-22,276,330!2026-01-27,264,330!2026-02-28,282,330!2026-02-16,270,330!2026-01-15,253,330!2026-02-27,281,330!2026-02-21,275,330-->

## asynchronous sequential logic

- Main article: ::@:: [Asynchronous circuit](asynchronous%20circuit.md) <!--SR:!2026-02-22,276,330!2026-01-17,255,330-->

{@{_Asynchronous_ \(_clockless_ or _self-timed_\) _sequential logic_}@} is {@{not synchronized by a clock signal}@}; {@{the outputs of the circuit}@} {@{change directly in response to changes in inputs}@}. {@{The advantage of asynchronous logic}@} is that {@{it can be faster than synchronous logic}@}, because {@{the circuit doesn't have to wait for a clock signal to process inputs}@}. {@{The speed of the device}@} is {@{potentially limited only by the [propagation delays](propagation%20delay.md) of the [logic gates](logic%20gate.md) used}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-25,263,330!2026-01-24,262,330!2026-02-22,276,330!2026-01-14,252,330!2025-12-29,241,330!2026-02-18,272,330!2025-12-31,243,330!2025-12-27,240,330!2026-02-21,275,330-->

However, asynchronous logic is {@{more difficult to design and is subject to problems not encountered in synchronous designs}@}. The main problem is that {@{digital memory elements are sensitive to the order that their input signals arrive}@}; if {@{two signals arrive at a [flip-flop](flip-flop%20(electronics).md) or latch at almost the same time}@}, {@{which state the circuit goes into can depend on which signal gets to the gate first}@}. Therefore, the circuit can {@{go into the wrong state}@}, depending on {@{small differences in the [propagation delays](propagation%20delay.md) of the logic gates}@}. This is called {@{a [race condition](race%20condition.md)}@}. This problem is {@{not as severe in synchronous circuits}@} because {@{the outputs of the memory elements only change at each clock pulse}@}. {@{The interval between clock signals}@} is {@{designed to be long enough to allow the outputs of the memory elements to "settle"}@} so {@{they are not changing when the next clock comes}@}. Therefore, {@{the only timing problems are due to "asynchronous inputs"}@}; inputs to the circuit {@{from other systems which are not synchronized to the clock signal}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,283,330!2026-01-29,266,330!2026-02-15,269,330!2026-07-08,378,310!2026-01-21,259,330!2026-03-03,285,330!2026-03-08,290,330!2026-01-26,263,330!2026-01-24,262,330!2026-01-08,250,330!2026-02-27,281,330!2026-01-06,248,330!2026-01-20,258,330!2026-03-11,293,330-->

Asynchronous sequential circuits are typically {@{used only in a few critical parts of otherwise synchronous systems}@} where {@{speed is at a premium}@}, such as {@{parts of microprocessors and [digital signal processing](digital%20signal%20processing.md) circuits}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,282,330!2026-02-22,276,330!2026-02-26,280,330-->

{@{The design of asynchronous logic}@} uses {@{different mathematical models and techniques from synchronous logic}@}, and is {@{an active area of research}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-30,242,330!2026-03-12,294,330!2026-02-22,276,330-->
