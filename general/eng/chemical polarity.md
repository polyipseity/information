# chemical polarity

In [chemistry](chemistry.md), __polarity__ is {@{the separation of [electric charge](electric%20charge.md) such that a [molecule](molecule.md) has an [electric dipole moment](electric%20dipole%20moment.md)}@}.

Polar molecules contain {@{[polar bonds](#bond%20polarity), created by differences in the [electronegativities](electronegativity.md) of the bonded [atoms](atom.md), that do not cancel out each other due to [molecular symmetry](molecular%20symmetry.md)}@}.

## bond polarity

{@{Differences in the [electronegativity](electronegativity.md) of the two [atoms](atom.md) in a [bond](chemical%20bond.md) leads to uneven sharing of [electrons](electron.md)}@}, creating [partial charges](partial%20charge.md), {@{which are denoted as δ+ ([delta](delta%20(letter).md) plus) and δ- (delta minus)}@}.
