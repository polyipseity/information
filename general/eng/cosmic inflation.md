# cosmic inflation

In [physical cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md), __cosmic inflation__, __cosmological inflation__, or just __inflation__, is {@{a theory of exponential [expansion of space](expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md) in the early [universe](universe.md)}@}. The [inflationary epoch](inflationary%20epoch.md) is believed to have lasted {@{from 10<sup>−36</sup> seconds to between 10<sup>−33</sup> and 10<sup>−32</sup> seconds after the [Big Bang](Big%20Bang.md)}@}. Following the inflationary period, the universe {@{continued to expand, but at a slower rate}@}. {@{The re-acceleration of this slowing expansion due to [dark energy](dark%20energy.md)}@} began after {@{the universe was already over 7.7 billion years old (5.4 billion years ago)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-11-06,592,310!2027-12-19,829,270!2028-09-01,1147,350!2027-05-14,752,330!2025-12-02,314,290-->
