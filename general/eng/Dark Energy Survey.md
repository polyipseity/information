# Dark Energy Survey

{@{The __Dark Energy Survey__ (__DES__)}@} is {@{an [astronomical survey](astronomical%20survey.md) designed to constrain the properties of [dark energy](dark%20energy.md)}@}. It uses {@{images taken in the near-[ultraviolet](ultraviolet.md), [visible](visible%20spectrum.md), and near-[infrared](infrared.md)}@} to {@{measure the [expansion of the universe](expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md) using [Type Ia supernovae](Type%20Ia%20supernova.md), [baryon acoustic oscillations](baryon%20acoustic%20oscillations.md), the number of [galaxy clusters](galaxy%20groups%20and%20clusters.md), and [weak gravitational lensing](weak%20gravitational%20lensing.md)}@}. The collaboration is composed of {@{research institutions and universities}@} from the United States, Australia, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Switzerland. The collaboration is {@{divided into several scientific working groups}@}. The director of DES is {@{[Josh Frieman](Joshua%20A.%20Frieman.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-06,303,330!2025-06-11,234,330!2026-07-14,515,310!2025-04-26,160,250!2025-09-05,303,330!2027-02-01,686,330!2027-05-04,762,330-->
