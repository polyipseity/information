# impairment

__Impairment__ of {@{assets is the diminishing in quality, strength, amount, or value of an asset}@}. {@{An impairment cost must be included under expenses}@} when {@{the [book value](book%20value.md) of an [asset](asset.md) exceeds the recoverable amount}@}. {@{[Fixed assets](fixed%20asset.md), commonly known as PPE \(Property, Plant & Equipment\)}@}, refers to {@{long-lived assets such as buildings, land, machinery, and equipment}@}; these assets are {@{the most likely to experience impairment, which may be caused by several factors}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-15,292,330!2026-01-10,288,330!2027-11-15,798,330!2027-11-13,795,330!2027-10-12,771,330!2026-01-14,291,330-->

## history

Asset impairment was first addressed by {@{the [International Accounting Standards Board](International%20Accounting%20Standards%20Board.md) \(IASB\)}@} in {@{[IAS 16](IAS%2016.md), which became effective in 1983}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> It was replaced by {@{[IAS 36](list%20of%20International%20Financial%20Reporting%20Standards.md), effective July 1999}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-11-18,513,310!2025-12-19,216,250!2027-09-14,677,270-->

In {@{[United States](United%20States.md) [GAAP](accounting%20standard.md)}@}, {@{the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](Financial%20Accounting%20Standards%20Board.md) \(FASB\)}@} introduced the concept in {@{1995 with the release of [SFAS 121](list%20of%20FASB%20pronouncements.md)}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> SFAS 121 was subsequently replaced by {@{[SFAS 144](list%20of%20FASB%20pronouncements.md) in August 2001}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-17,294,330!2027-08-27,739,330!2027-01-14,494,250!2025-11-12,216,270-->

The issue of {@{impairment of financial assets exposed deficiencies in the IAS 36 framework}@} during {@{the [2008 financial crisis](2007–2008%20financial%20crisis.md)}@}, and the IASB issued {@{an [exposure draft](exposure%20draft.md) in November 2009}@} that {@{proposed an impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses for all financial assets recorded at amortised cost}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> {@{The IASB and FASB made joint efforts to devise a common impairment model}@}, but {@{the FASB eventually decided to propose an alternative scheme in January 2011}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> The IASB issued {@{a new exposure draft in January 2013}@},<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> which later {@{led to the adoption of [IFRS 9](IFRS%209.md) in July 2014}@},<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> effective for {@{annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> The FASB is {@{still considering the matter}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-19,300,290!2027-09-17,750,330!2027-10-16,734,290!2026-02-10,293,290!2026-01-07,285,330!2027-12-05,770,290!2025-11-12,216,270!2027-09-18,688,270!2026-02-25,299,290!2026-01-04,283,330-->

## IAS 36 framework

Impairment is {@{currently governed by [IAS 36](list%20of%20International%20Financial%20Reporting%20Standards.md)}@}. The impairment cost is calculated using either the Incurred Loss Model or the Expected Loss Model. <!--SR:!2028-01-08,795,290-->

### Incurred Loss Model

{@{An investment is recognized as impaired}@} when {@{there is no longer reasonable assurance that the [future cash flows](cash%20flow.md) associated with it will be collected either in their entirety or when due}@}. Entities look for {@{evidence of situations that would indicate impairment}@}. Such triggering events include when the entity<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> – <!--SR:!2026-01-05,284,330!2026-02-26,300,290!2026-01-11,289,330-->

- \(annotation: difficulties\) ::@:: is experiencing notable financial difficulties, <!--SR:!2025-12-30,279,330!2026-01-06,285,330-->
- \(annotation: payments\) ::@:: has defaulted on or is late making interest payments or principal payments, <!--SR:!2026-01-07,285,330!2026-01-11,289,330-->
- \(annotation: organization\) ::@:: is likely to undergo a major financial reorganization or enter bankruptcy, or <!--SR:!2027-12-03,811,330!2026-01-05,284,330-->
- \(annotation: market\) ::@:: is in a market that is experiencing significant negative economic change. <!--SR:!2026-01-06,285,330!2026-01-15,292,330-->

If {@{such evidence exists}@}, the next step is to {@{estimate the recoverable amount of investments}@}. {@{The __impairment cost__}@} would then be calculated as follows: {@{$${\text{Impairment Cost} }={ {\text{Recoverable Amount} }-{\text{Carrying Value} } }$$}@} {@{The [carrying value](book%20value.md)}@} is defined as {@{the (annotation: net) value of the asset appearing on the [balance sheet](balance%20sheet.md)}@}. {@{The recoverable amount}@} is {@{the higher of either the asset's [future value](future%20value.md)<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> for the company or the amount it can be sold for, minus any [transaction costs](transaction%20cost.md)}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup><sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-29,278,330!2027-12-04,812,330!2025-12-29,278,330!2027-03-07,553,310!2026-01-01,281,330!2026-01-16,293,330!2027-08-09,721,330!2026-12-26,528,310-->

### Expected Loss Model

{@{Estimates of [future cash flows](cash%20flow.md) used to determine the present value of an investment}@} are {@{made on a continuous basis and do not rely on a triggering event to occur}@}. Even though {@{there may be no objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred}@}, {@{revised cash flow projections may indicate changes in [credit risk](credit%20risk.md)}@}. These revised expected cash flows are {@{[discounted](discounting.md) at the same effective interest rate used when the instrument was first acquired}@}, therefore {@{retaining a [cost-based measurement](historical%20cost.md)}@}. {@{Calculating the __impairment cost__}@} is {@{the same as under the Incurred Loss Model}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-12,290,330!2027-09-26,758,330!2026-01-03,282,330!2027-11-21,802,330!2026-04-27,343,290!2025-12-31,279,330!2025-12-31,280,330!2026-01-17,294,330-->

For example, assume {@{a company has an investment in Company A bonds with a carrying amount of \$37,500}@}. If {@{their [market value](market%20value.md) falls to \$33,000}@}, {@{an impairment loss of \$4,500 is indicated}@} and the impairment cost calculated as follows: {@{$$\$37500-\$33000=\$4500$$}@} This is recorded as {@{a loss of \$4,500 in the [income statement](income%20statement.md)}@}. Using {@{the ['T' account](debits%20and%20credits.md#t-accounts) system}@}, there will be {@{a debit in the Loss on Impairment account and a credit in the Investment account}@}. This will mean {@{the [double-entry bookkeeping](double-entry%20bookkeeping.md) principle is satisfied}@}. <p> (annotation: 'T' account system example) <br/> {@{__Debit:__ Loss on Impairment \$4,500 <br/> &emsp;&emsp; __Credit:__ Investment \$4,500<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup>}@} <!--SR:!2026-10-08,470,310!2028-02-12,854,330!2026-01-16,293,330!2027-11-29,808,330!2025-12-28,277,330!2026-01-02,281,330!2027-06-12,611,310!2026-01-14,291,330!2027-11-23,803,330-->

### effect on depreciation

To {@{calculate [depreciation](depreciation.md) on the asset}@}, {@{the new non-current asset value is considered}@}. Continuing with the previous example and using {@{the [Straight line Depreciation](depreciation.md#methods%20of%20depreciation) method at say, 20%}@}, depreciation would be: {@{$$\$33000\cdot 0.2=\$6600$$}@} The depreciation charge is {@{smaller than if the original non-current asset value had been used}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-15,292,330!2027-11-19,801,330!2026-01-08,286,330!2025-12-30,279,330!2027-11-06,790,330-->

### consequential asset value increases

{@{Reversal of impairment losses}@} is {@{required for investments in [debt instruments](bond%20market.md)}@}, but {@{no reversal is permitted under [IFRS](International%20Financial%20Reporting%20Standards.md)}@} for {@{any impairment changes recognized in net income for equity instruments accounted for in [OCI](accumulated%20other%20comprehensive%20income.md#other%20comprehensive%20income) (annotation: other comprehensive income)}@}; however, {@{subsequent changes in the equity investment's fair value}@} are {@{recognized in [OCI](accumulated%20other%20comprehensive%20income.md#other%20comprehensive%20income)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-19,271,330!2027-08-16,728,330!2026-11-24,519,310!2026-09-25,384,250!2026-01-09,287,330!2026-01-12,290,330-->
