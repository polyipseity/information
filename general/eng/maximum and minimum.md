# maximum and minimum

> [!tip] tips

> - a weird way to find the maximum and minimum of 2 numbers ::@:: $$\begin{aligned} \max \set{a, b} & = \frac {a + b} 2 + \frac {\lvert a - b \rvert} 2 \\ \min \set{a, b} & = \frac {a + b} 2 - \frac {\lvert a - b \rvert} 2 \end{aligned}$$
>   - explanation of the weird way to find the maximum and minimum of 2 numbers ::@:: The first term is halfway between $a$ and $b$. The second term is half of the difference between $a$ and $b$. Adding both terms leads to the larger number. Subtracting the latter from the former leads to the smaller number.
