> - a weird way to find the maximum and minimum of 2 numbers ::@:: $$\begin{aligned} \max \set{a, b} & = \frac {a + b} 2 + \frac {\lvert a - b \rvert} 2 \\ \min \set{a, b} & = \frac {a + b} 2 - \frac {\lvert a - b \rvert} 2 \end{aligned}$$ <!--SR:!2028-10-13,1215,350!2026-08-29,399,310-->
>   - explanation of the weird way to find the maximum and minimum of 2 numbers ::@:: The first term is halfway between $a$ and $b$. The second term is half of the difference between $a$ and $b$. Adding both terms leads to the larger number. Subtracting the latter from the former leads to the smaller number. <!--SR:!2028-05-06,1086,350!2029-05-23,1383,350-->
