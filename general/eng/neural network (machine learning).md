# neural network

Advantages of neural network include {@{highly parallel, making it suitable for parallel processing, and fault tolerance, in which small number of broken neurons degrade the model only slightly}@}. <!--SR:!2027-10-25,952,350-->

## models

### artificial neurons

ANNs are composed of {@{[artificial neurons](artificial%20neuron.md)}@}, which are conceptually {@{derived from biological [neurons](neuron.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-14,302,330!2025-05-14,257,330-->
