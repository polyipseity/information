# neural network

Advantages of neural network include {@{highly parallel, making it suitable for parallel processing, and fault tolerance, in which small number of broken neurons degrade the model only slightly}@}.

## models

### artificial neurons

ANNs are composed of {@{[artificial neurons](artificial%20neuron.md)}@}, which are conceptually {@{derived from biological [neurons](neuron.md)}@}.
