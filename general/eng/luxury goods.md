In [economics](economics.md), {@{a __luxury good__ \(or __upmarket good__\)}@} is {@{a [good](goods.md) for which [demand](demand.md) increases more than what is proportional as [income](income.md) rises}@}, so that {@{expenditures on the good become a more significant proportion of overall spending}@}. Luxury goods are {@{in contrast to [necessity goods](necessity%20good.md)}@}, where {@{demand increases proportionally less than income}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> _Luxury goods_ is often used {@{synonymously with [superior goods](luxury%20goods.md#economics)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-11,273,330!2025-10-06,246,330!2025-07-21,170,310!2025-09-24,235,330!2025-09-04,203,310!2025-07-17,167,310-->

## definition and etymology

{@{The word "luxury"}@} derives from {@{the [Latin](Latin.md) verb _luxor_}@} meaning {@{to overextend or strain}@}. From this, {@{the noun _luxuria_ and verb _luxurio_}@} developed, "indicating {@{immoderate growth, swelling, ... in persons and animals, willful or unruly behavior, disregard for moral restraints, and licensciousness}@}", and the term has {@{had negative connotations for most of its long history}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> {@{One definition in the [OED](Oxford%20English%20Dictionary.md)}@} is {@{a "thing desirable but not necessary"}@}. A luxury good can be identified by {@{comparing the demand for the good at one point in time}@} against {@{the demand for the good at a different time, at a different income level}@}. When {@{personal income increases}@}, demand for luxury goods {@{increases even more than income does}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-10,272,330!2025-10-08,247,330!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-09-27,237,330!2025-08-26,196,310!2025-09-26,237,330!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-11-02,264,330!2025-10-09,247,330!2025-08-05,182,310!2025-10-03,243,330!2025-02-15,67,310-->

Conversely, when {@{personal income decreases}@}, {@{demand for luxury goods drops even more than income does}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> For example, if {@{income rises 1%, and the demand for a product rises 2%}@}, then {@{the product is a luxury good}@}. This {@{contrasts with _necessity goods_, or _basic goods_}@}, for which {@{demand stays the same or decreases only slightly as income decreases}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-19,280,330!2025-07-20,182,310!2025-10-04,243,330!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-07-19,169,310!2025-10-05,243,330-->

### scope of the term

With {@{increasing accessibility to luxury goods}@},<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> {@{new product categories have been created}@} within the luxury market, called {@{"accessible luxury" or "mass luxury"}@}. These are meant {@{specifically for the [middle class](middle%20class.md), sometimes called the "aspiring class" in this context}@}. Because {@{luxury has diffused into the masses}@}, {@{defining the word}@} has become more difficult.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-03,243,330!2025-11-08,270,330!2025-11-10,272,330!2025-09-19,231,330!2025-11-13,275,330!2025-10-04,241,330-->

Whereas {@{luxury often refers to certain types of products}@}, luxury is {@{not restricted to physical goods; services can also be luxury}@}. Likewise, from {@{the consumer perspective}@}, luxury is {@{an experience defined as "hedonic escapism"}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-01,265,330!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-09-18,230,330!2025-11-25,285,330-->

### confusion with normal goods

{@{"Superior goods"}@} is {@{the [gradable antonym](opposite%20(semantics).md#gradable%20antonym) of "[inferior good](inferior%20good.md)"}@}. If {@{the quantity of an item [demanded](demand.md) increases with income}@}, but {@{not by enough to increase the share of the [budget](budget.md) spent on it}@}, then {@{it is only a [normal good](normal%20good.md) and is not a superior good}@}. {@{Consumption of all normal goods increases}@} as {@{income increases}@}. For example, if {@{income increases by 50%}@}, then consumption will {@{increase \(maybe by only 1%, maybe by 40%, maybe by 70%\)}@}. A superior good is {@{a normal good for which the proportional consumption increase exceeds the [proportional income increase](income%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md#mathematical%20definition)}@}. So, if {@{income increases by 50%}@}, then {@{consumption of a superior good will increase by more than 50% \(maybe 51%, maybe 70%\)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-25,285,330!2025-09-17,229,330!2025-11-13,275,330!2025-08-27,197,310!2025-11-11,273,330!2025-11-05,267,330!2025-11-13,275,330!2025-11-21,281,330!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-11-07,269,330!2025-11-12,274,330!2025-02-15,67,310-->

In economics terminology, {@{all goods with an [income elasticity of demand](income%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md) greater than zero}@} are "normal", but {@{only the subset having income elasticity of demand \> 1 are "superior"}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-03-24,81,270!2025-10-29,263,330-->

Some articles in the [microeconomics](microeconomics.md) discipline use {@{the term _superior good_ as an alternative to an _inferior good_}@}, thus {@{making "superior goods" and "normal goods" synonymous}@}. Where this is done, {@{a product making up an increasing share of spending under income increases}@} is {@{often called an _ultra-superior good_}@}.<!-- <sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> --> <!--SR:!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-11-19,280,330!2025-07-22,171,310!2025-11-04,266,330-->

By this time, such {@{lavish bindings were unusual}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-09-25,236,330!2025-11-05,267,330!2025-03-24,81,270!2025-10-26,260,330-->

Though {@{often verging on the meaningless in modern marketing}@}, "luxury" remains {@{a legitimate and current technical term in [art history](art%20history.md)}@} for {@{objects that are especially highly decorated to very high standards and use expensive materials}@}. The term is {@{especially used for [medieval](Middle%20Ages.md) [manuscripts](manuscript.md)}@} to {@{distinguish between practical working books for normal use}@}, and {@{fully [illuminated manuscripts](illuminated%20manuscript.md), that were often bound in [treasure bindings](treasure%20binding.md) with metalwork and jewels}@}. These are often {@{much larger, with less text on each page and many illustrations}@}, and {@{if [liturgical texts](liturgical%20book.md)}@} were {@{originally usually kept on the [altar](Altar%20(Catholic%20Church).md) or [sacristy](sacristy.md)}@} rather {@{any library that the church or [monastery](monastery.md) who owned them may have had}@}. {@{Secular luxury manuscripts}@} were {@{commissioned by the very wealthy and differed in the same ways from cheaper books}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-10-06,245,330!2025-08-04,181,310!2025-10-10,248,330!2025-11-21,281,330!2025-09-02,201,310!2025-08-23,193,310!2025-10-02,242,330!2025-10-08,247,330!2025-10-19,255,330!2025-11-07,269,330!2025-08-06,183,310-->

{@{"Luxury" and "luxury arts"}@} may be used for {@{other [applied arts](applied%20arts.md) where both utilitarian and luxury versions of the same types of objects were made}@}.

### characteristics

Luxury goods have {@{high [income elasticity of demand](income%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md)}@}: as {@{people become wealthier}@}, they will {@{buy proportionately more luxury goods}@}. This also means that {@{should there be a decline in income}@}, {@{its demand will drop more than proportionately}@}. {@{The income elasticity of demand}@} is {@{not constant with respect to income and may change signs at different income levels}@}. That is to say, {@{a luxury good may become a [necessity good](necessity%20good.md) or even an [inferior good](inferior%20good.md) at different income levels}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-04,244,330!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-10-22,257,330!2025-11-16,277,330!2025-11-19,280,330!2025-08-28,198,310!2025-10-11,249,330!2025-11-10,272,330-->

Some luxury products have been claimed to be {@{examples of [Veblen goods](Veblen%20good.md)}@}, with {@{a positive [price elasticity of demand](price%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md)}@}: for example, making a perfume {@{more expensive can increase its perceived value as a luxury good}@} to such an extent that {@{sales can go up, rather than down}@}. However, [Veblen goods](Veblen%20good.md) are {@{not synonymous with luxury goods}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-24,194,310!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-11-12,274,330!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-11-23,283,330-->

Although {@{the technical term luxury good is independent of the goods' quality}@}, they are {@{generally considered to be goods at the highest end of the market in terms of quality and price}@}. Many markets have {@{a luxury segment}@} including, for example, luxury versions of [automobiles](car.md), [yachts](yacht.md), [wine](wine.md), [bottled water](bottled%20water.md), [coffee](coffee.md), [tea](tea.md), [foods](food.md), [watches](watch.md), [clothes](clothing.md), [jewelry](jewellery.md), [cosmetics](cosmetics.md) and [high fidelity](high%20fidelity.md) sound equipment.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> Luxuries may be {@{services}@}. {@{Hiring full-time or live-in [domestic servants](domestic%20worker.md)}@} is {@{a luxury reflecting income disparities}@}. {@{Some financial services, especially in some brokerage houses}@}, can be considered {@{luxury services by default}@} because {@{persons in lower-income brackets generally do not use them}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-20,281,330!2025-09-21,232,330!2025-09-24,235,330!2025-11-09,272,330!2025-10-07,245,330!2025-10-10,249,330!2025-11-06,268,330!2025-06-05,136,290!2025-02-14,66,310-->

Luxury goods often have {@{special [luxury packaging](luxury%20packaging.md)}@} to {@{differentiate the products from mainstream competitors}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-22,233,330!2025-11-09,271,330-->

### trends

Originally, luxury goods were available {@{only to the very wealthy and "aristocratic world of old money"}@} that offered them {@{a history of tradition, superior quality, and a pampered buying experience}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> Luxury goods have been transformed by {@{a shift from custom-made \([bespoke](bespoke.md)\) works}@} with {@{[exclusive distribution](distribution%20(marketing).md) practices by specialized, quality-minded family-run and small businesses}@} to {@{a [mass production](mass%20production.md) of specialty [branded](brand.md) goods}@} by {@{profit-focused large corporations and marketers}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> The trend in modern luxury is {@{simply a product or service that is marketed, packaged, and sold by global corporations}@} that are focused "{@{on growth, visibility, brand awareness, advertising, and, above all, profits}@}."<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> Increasingly, {@{luxury logos}@} are now available to {@{all consumers at a premium price across the world, including online}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-05-25,124,290!2025-11-25,285,330!2025-11-14,276,330!2025-09-28,239,330!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-10-11,250,330!2025-07-26,174,310!2025-11-20,280,330!2025-10-24,259,330-->

{@{Global consumer companies}@}, such as {@{[Procter & Gamble](Procter%20&%20Gamble.md)}@}, are also {@{attracted to the industry}@} due to {@{the difficulty of making a [profit](profit%20(accounting).md) in the mass consumer goods market}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> {@{The customer base for various luxury goods}@} continue to be {@{more culturally diversified}@}, and this {@{presents more unseen challenges and new opportunities to companies in this industry}@}.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-06,268,330!2025-11-20,281,330!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-09-30,240,330!2025-08-24,194,310!2025-10-07,245,330!2025-09-15,227,330-->

There are several trends in luxury:<sup>[\[16\]](#^ref-16)</sup>

- _Democratization of luxury._ ::@:: Also known as [masstige](masstige.md) \(from mass-prestige\), is a marketing strategy that aims to make brands prestigious while retaining their affordability.<sup>[\[17\]](#^ref-17)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-09-01,201,310!2025-11-03,267,330-->
- _[Globalization](globalization.md):_ ::@:: Consumers in some countries are becoming wealthier; thus, new markets are opening for luxury marketers.<sup>[\[18\]](#^ref-18)</sup> Reports by consulting agencies like [McKinsey](McKinsey%20&%20Company.md) predicted that East Asia would become the world's largest personal luxury goods market.

- _[Consolidation](consolidation%20(business).md):_ ::@:: Consolidation involves the growth of big companies and ownership of brands across many segments of luxury products. Examples include [Kering](Kering.md), [LVMH](LVMH.md), and [Richemont](Richemont.md), which dominate the market in areas ranging from luxury drinks to fashion and cosmetics.<sup>[\[21\]](#^ref-21)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-14,66,310-->
- {@{_Luxury brand collaborations._}@} This [marketing strategy](marketing%20strategy.md) demonstrates {@{the potential of unexpected partnerships and [co-branding](co-branding.md) opportunities}@} between {@{luxury brands and an unconventional partner seemingly at the opposite end of the design spectrum}@}.<sup>[\[20\]](#^ref-20)</sup> Collaborations include pairings of {@{luxury brands like _[Fendi](Fendi.md) x [Versace](Versace.md)_}@} but also pairings with {@{streetwear brands including skateboarding brand _[Supreme](Supreme%20(brand).md) x [LVMH](LVMH.md)_}@}, with {@{celebrities such as _[Bad Bunny](Bad%20Bunny.md) x [Adidas](Adidas.md)_}@}, {@{anime characters like _[Doraemon](Doraemon.md) x [Gucci](Gucci.md)_}@}, and now {@{video game franchises like _[Fortnite](Fortnite.md) x [Balenciaga](Balenciaga.md)_}@}.<sup>[\[22\]](#^ref-22)</sup> The collaborations are {@{often [limited edition](special%20edition.md) collections}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-08,271,330!2025-09-27,238,330!2025-07-14,164,310!2025-11-19,280,330!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-07-18,168,310!2025-10-14,250,330!2025-09-27,238,330!2025-02-15,67,310-->

### size

The luxury goods market has been {@{on an upward climb for many years}@}. Apart from {@{the setback caused by the [1997 Asian Financial Crisis](1997%20Asian%20financial%20crisis.md)}@}, the industry has {@{performed well, particularly in 2000}@}. That year, the world luxury goods market was worth nearly \$170 billion and grew 7.9 percent.<sup>[\[23\]](#^ref-23)</sup> {@{The United States}@} has been {@{the largest regional market for luxury goods}@}. The largest sector in this category was {@{luxury drinks, including premium [whisky](whisky.md), [champagne](champagne.md), and [cognac](cognac.md)}@}.<!-- <sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> --> {@{The watches and jewelry section}@} showed {@{the strongest performance}@}, growing in value by 23.3 percent, while {@{the clothing and accessories section}@} grew 11.6 percent between 1996 and 2000, to \$32.8 billion. {@{The largest ten markets for luxury goods}@} account for {@{83 percent of overall sales}@} and include Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom, and United States.<!-- <sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> --> <!--SR:!2025-11-17,278,330!2025-03-25,80,270!2025-07-17,167,310!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-10-12,249,330!2025-09-26,237,330!2025-11-02,266,330!2025-09-30,240,330!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-11-13,275,330!2025-07-27,175,310-->

In {@{2012, [China](economy%20of%20China.md)}@} surpassed {@{[Japan](economy%20of%20Japan.md) as the world's largest luxury market}@}.<sup>[\[24\]](#^ref-24)</sup> {@{China's luxury consumption}@} accounts for {@{over 25% of the global market}@}.<sup>[\[25\]](#^ref-25)</sup> According to {@{the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020}@}, {@{[Hong Kong](Hong%20Kong.md), [Shanghai](Shanghai.md), [Tokyo](Tokyo.md) and [Singapore](Singapore.md)}@} were {@{four of the five most expensive cities for luxury goods in Asia}@}.<sup>[\[26\]](#^ref-26)</sup> In {@{2014, the luxury sector}@} was {@{expected to grow over the following ten years}@} because of 440 million consumers spending a total of 880 billion euros, or \$1.2 trillion.<sup>[\[27\]](#^ref-27)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-10,272,330!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-09-23,234,330!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-11-22,282,330!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-08-29,198,310!2025-06-02,131,290-->

### advertising

{@{The advertising expenditure for the average luxury brand}@} is {@{5-15% of sales [revenue](revenue.md)}@}, or {@{about 25% with the inclusion of other communications such as [public relations](public%20relations.md), events, and sponsorships}@}.<sup>[\[28\]](#^ref-28)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-07,246,330!2025-07-20,170,310!2025-10-10,249,330-->

{@{A rather small group}@} in comparison, the wealthy {@{tend to be extremely influential}@}.<sup>[\[29\]](#^ref-29)</sup> Once {@{a brand gets an "endorsement" from members of this group}@}, then {@{the brand can be defined as a true "luxury" brand}@}.

In economics, {@{__superior goods__ or __luxury goods__}@} make up {@{a larger _proportion_ of [consumption](consumption%20(economics).md) as [income](income.md) rises}@}, and therefore are {@{a type of [normal goods](normal%20good.md) in [consumer theory](consumer%20choice.md)}@}. Such a good must {@{possess two economic characteristics}@}: it {@{must be [scarce](scarcity.md), and, along with that, it must have a high price}@}.<sup>[\[31\]](#^ref-31)</sup> {@{The scarcity of the good}@} can be {@{natural or artificial}@}; however, the general population \(i.e., [consumers](consumer.md)\) must {@{recognize the good as distinguishably _better_}@}. {@{Possession of such a good}@} usually {@{signifies "[superiority](superior%20(hierarchy).md)" in resources and is usually accompanied by prestige}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-03,267,330!2025-11-06,269,330!2025-11-08,270,330!2025-10-05,242,330!2025-07-09,173,310!2025-11-12,274,330!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-10-24,259,330!2025-10-06,246,330!2025-11-24,284,330-->

{@{A [Veblen good](Veblen%20good.md)}@} is {@{a superior good with a prestige value so high}@} that {@{a price decline might _lower_ demand}@}.

## luxury brands

The idea of {@{a luxury [brand](brand.md)}@} is {@{not necessarily a product or a price point, but a [mindset](mindset.md)}@} where {@{core values that are expressed by a brand are directly connected to the producer's dedication and alignment to perceptions of quality with its customers' values and aspirations}@}.<sup>[\[36\]](#^ref-36)</sup> Thus, it is {@{these target customers, not the product}@}, that {@{make a luxury brand}@}.<sup>[\[36\]](#^ref-36)</sup> Brands considered luxury connect with their customers by {@{communicating that they are at the top of their class or considered the best in their field}@}.<sup>[\[37\]](#^ref-37)</sup> Furthermore, these brands must {@{deliver – in some meaningful way – measurably better performance}@}.<sup>[\[37\]](#^ref-37)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-09-25,236,330!2025-10-18,254,330!2025-09-20,231,330!2025-10-05,245,330!2025-11-24,284,330!2025-09-30,239,330!2025-11-04,268,330-->

{@{What consumers perceive as luxurious brands and products}@} {@{change over the years}@}, but there appear to be {@{three main drivers}@}: \(1\) {@{a high price, especially when compared to other brands within its segment}@}; \(2\) {@{limited supply, in that a brand may not need to be expensive}@}, but {@{it arguably should not be easily obtainable and contributing to the customers' feeling that they have something special}@}; and \(3\) {@{endorsement by celebrities, which can make a brand or particular products more appealing for consumers and thus more "luxurious" in their minds}@}.<sup>[\[38\]](#^ref-38)</sup> {@{Two additional elements of luxury brands}@} include {@{special packaging and personalization}@}.<sup>[\[38\]](#^ref-38)</sup> These differentiating elements {@{distance the brands from the mass market}@} and thus provide them with {@{a unique feeling and user experience as well as a special and memorable "luxury feel" for customers}@}.<sup>[\[38\]](#^ref-38)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-28,262,330!2025-10-26,260,330!2025-10-11,250,330!2025-07-08,172,310!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-09-01,200,310!2025-05-20,123,290!2025-11-09,271,330!2025-10-09,248,330!2025-11-23,283,330!2025-02-15,67,310-->

Examples include {@{[LVMH](LVMH.md), the largest luxury goods producer in the world}@} with {@{over fifty brands \(including [Louis Vuitton](Louis%20Vuitton.md)\)}@}<sup>[\[39\]](#^ref-39)</sup> and sales of €42.6 billion in 2017,<sup>[\[40\]](#^ref-40)</sup> {@{[Kering](Kering.md)}@}, which made €15.9 billion in revenue for a net income of €2.3 billion in 2019,<sup>[\[41\]](#^ref-41)</sup> and {@{[Richemont](Richemont.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-12,251,330!2025-10-13,251,330!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-02-15,67,310-->

{@{The luxury brand concept}@} is now so popular that {@{it is used in almost every retail, manufacturing, and service sector}@}.<sup>[\[42\]](#^ref-42)</sup> {@{New marketing concepts such as "mass-luxury" or "hyper luxury"}@} further {@{blur the definition of what is a luxury product, a luxury brand, or a luxury company}@}.<sup>[\[42\]](#^ref-42)</sup> Lately, luxury brands have {@{extended their reach to young consumers through _unconventional luxury brand collaborations_}@} in which {@{luxury brands partner with non-luxury brands seemingly at the opposite spectrum of design, image, and value}@}.<sup>[\[20\]](#^ref-20)</sup> For example, luxury fashion houses partner with {@{streetwear brands and video games}@}.<sup>[\[43\]](#^ref-43)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-09-29,239,330!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-11-07,270,330!2025-11-16,277,330!2025-11-14,276,330!2025-10-05,244,330!2025-10-27,261,330-->

## luxury boutiques

{@{The sale of luxury goods}@} requires {@{a high level of client service, human touch, and brand consistency}@}. Since {@{the early 2010s}@}, many luxury brands have {@{invested in their own boutiques rather than wholesalers like department stores}@}. {@{Three of the world's biggest luxury conglomerates— LVMH, Kering, and Richemont}@} — significantly increased {@{the share of annual sales captured from their directly operated stores and e-commerce over the past decade}@}.<sup>[\[44\]](#^ref-44)</sup><sup>[\[45\]](#^ref-45)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-09-30,241,330!2025-08-05,182,310!2025-09-29,240,330!2025-11-11,273,330!2025-06-01,128,290-->

Luxury brands use {@{distinct boutique types}@} to {@{tailor the experiences of different client groups}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-15,253,330!2025-09-22,234,330-->

### flagship boutiques

{@{Flagship boutiques}@} are {@{grand, multi-story boutiques in major cities}@} that are {@{merchandised with a wide range of collections and staffed by a large team of sales associates}@}. They also offer {@{supplemental services, like jewelry cleaning, hot stamping, on-site service}@}.<sup>[\[46\]](#^ref-46)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-11-18,279,330!2025-02-27,27,290!2025-08-04,193,310-->

Many luxury brands use flagship boutiques to {@{illustrate their unique vision or heritage}@},<sup>[\[47\]](#^ref-47)</sup> often through {@{distinctive architecture<sup>[\[48\]](#^ref-48)</sup> that transforms them from storefronts to tourist attractions}@}.<sup>[\[49\]](#^ref-49)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-24,284,330!2025-11-23,283,330-->

### secondary boutiques

{@{Large cities}@} often have {@{secondary boutiques in addition to their flagship boutique}@}. Multiple boutiques allow {@{luxury brands to cater to different types of clients}@}, which can {@{differ even within small geographic areas}@}. Secondary boutiques often offer {@{different merchandise than flagship boutiques, and establish different types of relationships with clients}@}.<sup>[\[50\]](#^ref-50)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-09-21,233,330!2025-11-14,276,330!2025-10-02,241,330!2025-10-11,250,330-->

{@{Luxury boutiques in smaller cities}@} are {@{often secondary boutiques as well}@}.<sup>[\[46\]](#^ref-46)</sup> {@{The rising popularity of secondary and tertiary cities around the world}@} has pushed luxury brands to {@{open secondary boutiques in smaller cities than those that can support a flagship boutique}@}.<sup>[\[51\]](#^ref-51)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-21,256,330!2025-11-06,268,330!2025-09-23,235,330!2025-09-25,237,330-->

### seasonal boutiques

Luxury brands use {@{seasonal boutiques to follow their well-heeled clientele}@} as {@{they leave major cities for smaller resort towns in the summer and winter}@}.<sup>[\[52\]](#^ref-52)</sup> Common {@{throughout Europe}@}, seasonal boutiques have {@{short-term leases, like a pop-up shop}@}, which are {@{open only during the resort's high season}@}.<sup>[\[46\]](#^ref-46)</sup> These boutiques offer {@{merchandise relevant to the resort where they are located}@}, like {@{a cruise collection in a beach resort<sup>[\[53\]](#^ref-53)</sup> or skiwear in a mountain resort}@}.<sup>[\[54\]](#^ref-54)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-07-13,173,310!2025-05-30,128,290!2025-09-30,241,330!2025-11-07,269,330!2025-10-27,261,330!2025-07-15,165,310!2025-10-09,248,330-->
