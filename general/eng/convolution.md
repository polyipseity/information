# convolution

In [mathematics](mathematics.md) (in particular, {@{[functional analysis](functional%20analysis.md)}@}), __convolution__ is {@{a [mathematical operation](operation%20(mathematics).md) on two [functions](function%20(mathematics).md) ($f$ and $g$) that produces a third function ($f * g$)}@}. The term _convolution_ refers to {@{both the result function and to the process of computing it}@}. It is defined as {@{the [integral](integral.md) of the product of the two functions after one is reflected about the y-axis and shifted}@}. The integral is {@{evaluated for all values of shift (with the argument of the convolution function specifying the shift), producing the convolution function}@}. The choice of which function is reflected and shifted before the integral {@{does not change the integral result (see [commutativity](#properties))}@}. Graphically, it expresses {@{how the 'shape' of one function is modified by the other}@}. <!--SR:!2028-09-08,1162,350!2026-01-27,355,290!2028-01-21,974,350!2025-10-30,296,290!2027-04-25,748,330!2029-01-19,1265,350!2026-01-13,345,290-->

## definition

The convolution of $f$ and $g$ is written {@{$f * g$, denoting the operator with the symbol $*$}@}. It is defined as {@{the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reflected about the y-axis and shifted}@}. As such, it is {@{a particular kind of [integral transform](integral%20transform.md)}@}: {@{$$(f * g)(t) := \int_{-\infty}^\infty \! f(\tau) g(t - \tau) \,\mathrm{d}\tau$$}@}. An equivalent definition is (see {@{[commutativity](#properties)}@}): {@{$$(f * g)(t) := \int_{-\infty}^\infty \! f(t - \tau) g(\tau) \,\mathrm{d}\tau$$}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-09,1139,350!2025-11-14,307,290!2028-12-03,1167,310!2029-05-29,1368,350!2026-05-27,478,310!2027-09-04,855,330-->

While the symbol $t$ is used above, it {@{need not represent the time domain}@}. At each $t$, the convolution formula can be described as {@{the area under the function $f(\tau)$ weighted by the function $g(-\tau)$ shifted by the amount $t$}@}. As $t$ changes, {@{the weighting function $g(t - \tau)$ emphasizes different parts of the input function $f(\tau)$}@}; If {@{$t$ is a positive value}@}, then $g(t - \tau)$ is {@{equal to $g(-\tau)$ that slides or is shifted along the $\tau$-axis toward the right (toward $+\infty$) by the amount of $t$}@}, while if {@{$t$ is a negative value}@}, then $g(t - \tau)$ is equal to {@{$g(-\tau)$ that slides or is shifted toward the left (toward $-\infty$) by the amount of $\lvert t \rvert$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-10-05,601,330!2027-11-26,918,330!2028-10-09,1185,350!2028-01-22,975,350!2026-05-26,458,310!2028-01-20,973,350!2028-12-17,1239,350-->
