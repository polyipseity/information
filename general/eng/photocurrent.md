# photocurrent

__Photocurrent__ is {@{the [electric current](electric%20current.md) through a [photosensitive](photosensitivity.md) device due to exposure to [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md)}@}. It may be caused by {@{[photoelectric effect](photoelectric%20effect.md) or [photovoltaic effect](photovoltaic%20effect.md)}@}.

## calculation

The photocurrent can be calculated by the following equation:
{@{$$I_p=\frac{Q}t$$}@}
where {@{$Q$ is the [electric charge](electric%20charge.md) transferred over time $t$}@}. If $Q$ is in [coulombs](coulomb.md) and $t$ is in [seconds](second.md), $I_p$ is in [amperes](ampere.md).

## external voltage

By applying an external [voltage](voltage.md), the photocurrent can be {@{changed}@}. A voltage that increases the photocurrent ({@{positive voltage}@}) is called {@{accelerating potential}@}, while the inverse ({@{negative voltage}@}) is called {@{retarding potential}@}.

An accelerating potential {@{increases the photocurrent}@}, but only up to a point called {@{saturation current $I_s$}@}. The potential {@{attracts electrons to the anode}@}, {@{increasing the number of captured electrons}@}, thus the photocurrent. The saturation current is reached when {@{no more additional electrons can be captured}@}.

An retarding potential {@{decreases the photocurrent}@}. By increasing the retarding potential, when the photocurrent {@{just reach zero}@}, the potential at that point is called {@{stopping potential or cut-off potential $V_0$}@}. The potential {@{repels electrons}@}, {@{preventing low-energy electrons from reaching the anode}@}, thus decreasing the photocurrent. When the stopping potential is reached, {@{even the most energetic electron of kinetic energy $K_\mathrm{max}$ is stopped}@}, so the photocurrent is zero. In this case, the stopping potential is related by {@{$\mathrm{e}V_0=K_\mathrm{max}$}@}.

The resulting photocurrent-voltage curve is {@{[sigmoidal](sigmoid%20function.md)}@}.
