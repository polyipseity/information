# photocurrent

__Photocurrent__ is {@{the [electric current](electric%20current.md) through a [photosensitive](photosensitivity.md) device due to exposure to [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md)}@}. It may be caused by {@{[photoelectric effect](photoelectric%20effect.md) or [photovoltaic effect](photovoltaic%20effect.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-15,418,250!2027-08-30,1289,310-->

## calculation

The photocurrent can be calculated by the following equation:
{@{$$I_p=\frac{Q}t$$}@}
where {@{$Q$ is the [electric charge](electric%20charge.md) transferred over time $t$}@}. If $Q$ is in [coulombs](coulomb.md) and $t$ is in [seconds](second.md), $I_p$ is in [amperes](ampere.md). <!--SR:!2027-12-24,1441,350!2027-02-06,1144,310-->

## external voltage

By applying an external [voltage](voltage.md), the photocurrent can be {@{changed}@}. A voltage that increases the photocurrent ({@{positive voltage}@}) is called {@{accelerating potential}@}, while the inverse ({@{negative voltage}@}) is called {@{retarding potential}@}. <!--SR:!2026-10-20,1013,290!2026-11-30,1132,350!2031-04-07,2317,330!2027-10-17,1387,350!2027-06-15,1291,350-->

An accelerating potential {@{increases the photocurrent}@}, but only up to a point called {@{saturation current $I_s$}@}. The potential {@{attracts electrons to the anode}@}, {@{increasing the number of captured electrons}@}, thus the photocurrent. The saturation current is reached when {@{no more additional electrons can be captured}@}. <!--SR:!2029-02-27,1595,310!2027-08-07,1332,350!2025-08-15,644,270!2026-09-29,998,290!2026-08-19,968,290-->

An retarding potential {@{decreases the photocurrent}@}. By increasing the retarding potential, when the photocurrent {@{just reach zero}@}, the potential at that point is called {@{stopping potential or cut-off potential $V_0$}@}. The potential {@{repels electrons}@}, {@{preventing low-energy electrons from reaching the anode}@}, thus decreasing the photocurrent. When the stopping potential is reached, {@{even the most energetic electron of kinetic energy $K_\mathrm{max}$ is stopped}@}, so the photocurrent is zero. In this case, the stopping potential is related by {@{$\mathrm{e}V_0=K_\mathrm{max}$}@}. <!--SR:!2028-01-19,1389,310!2026-08-18,983,290!2025-03-07,544,270!2028-10-13,1545,290!2025-02-19,425,230!2026-09-28,815,230!2026-07-02,958,310-->

The resulting photocurrent-voltage curve is {@{[sigmoidal](sigmoid%20function.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-02-09,1191,350-->
