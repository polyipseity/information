# Schwarzschild radius

The {@{__Schwarzschild radius__ or the __gravitational radius__}@} is {@{a physical parameter in the [Schwarzschild solution](schwarzschild%20metric.md) to [Einstein's field equations](einstein%20field%20equations.md) that corresponds to the [radius](radius.md) defining the [event horizon](event%20horizon.md) of a Schwarzschild [black hole](black%20hole.md)}@}. It is {@{a characteristic radius}@} associated with any quantity of mass. The Schwarzschild radius was named after {@{the German astronomer [Karl Schwarzschild](Karl%20Schwarzschild.md), who calculated this exact solution for the theory of [general relativity](general%20relativity.md) in 1916}@}.

The Schwarzschild radius is given as {@{$$r_s = \frac {2GM} {c^2}$$, where _G_ is the [gravitational constant](gravitational%20constant.md), _M_ is the object mass, and _c_ is the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md)}@}.
