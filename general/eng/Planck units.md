#### Planck time

{@{The Planck time t<sub>P</sub>}@} is {@{the [time](time.md) required for [light](light.md) to travel a distance of 1 Planck length in [vacuum](vacuum.md)}@}, which is a time interval of {@{approximately 5.39×10<sup>−44</sup> [s](second.md)}@}. {@{No current physical theory can describe timescales}@} shorter than the Planck time, such as {@{the earliest events after the Big Bang}@}. Some conjectures state that {@{the structure of time need not remain smooth on intervals comparable to the Planck time}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-24,261,330!2025-03-29,163,310!2025-01-03,37,190!2025-08-02,268,330!2025-08-30,289,330!2025-03-29,165,310-->
