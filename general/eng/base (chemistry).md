# base (chemistry)

A __base__ is {@{a [molecule](molecule.md) or [ion](ion.md) that can accept a [proton](proton.md), known as a [Brønsted–Lowry base](Brønsted–Lowry%20acid–base%20theory.md), or form a [coordinate covalent bond](coordinate%20covalent%20bond.md) by donating an [electron pair](electron%20pair.md), known as a [Lewis base](Lewis%20acids%20and%20bases.md)}@}. Any base that {@{is [water](water.md) [soluble](solubility.md) and forms [hydroxide ions](hydroxide.md) is called an __[alkali](alkali.md)__}@}.

It is {@{an [electrolyte](electrolyte.md)}@}, can taste {@{bitter}@}, turns {@{red [litmus](litmus.md) blue}@}, and [neutralizes](neutralization%20(chemistry).md) {@{[acids](acid.md) to form [salts](salt%20(chemistry).md)}@}. {@{Strong bases}@} are [corrosive](corrosive%20substance.md).
