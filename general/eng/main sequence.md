# main sequence

The more [massive](mass.md) a [star](star.md) is, {@{the shorter its lifespan on the main sequence}@}. After {@{the [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) fuel at the core has been consumed}@}, the star {@{[evolves](stellar%20evolution.md) away from the main sequence on the [HR diagram](Hertzsprungâ€“Russell%20diagram.md), into a [supergiant](supergiant.md), [red giant](red%20giant.md), or directly to a [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md)}@}. Hypothetically, {@{[red dwarfs](red%20dwarf.md) directly turn into [blue dwarfs](blue%20dwarf%20(red-dwarf%20stage).md) after using up most of its [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) (and then later, [white dwarf](whit%20dwarf.md))}@}, but this has {@{yet to taken place due to predicted lifespans of red dwarfs being in the trillions of years}@}. <!--SR:!2029-09-18,1465,350!2026-08-07,544,310!2026-02-09,375,290!2027-02-15,632,270!2027-05-28,789,330-->

## luminosity-color variation

As {@{non-fusing helium accumulates in the core of a main-sequence star}@}, {@{the reduction in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass}@}. Since it is {@{fusion-supplied power}@} that {@{maintains the pressure of the core and supports the higher layers of the star}@} \(annotation: also {@{contributes partially}@}: {@{less nuclei per unit mass in the core, as 4 hydrogen nuclei are fused into 1 helium nucleus}@}\), the core {@{gradually gets compressed}@}. This brings {@{hydrogen-rich material into a shell around the helium-rich core}@} at {@{a depth where the pressure is sufficient for fusion to occur}@}, refilling {@{the core with hydrogen}@}. Yet, the core is {@{more compressed and hotter (higher temperature is needed to maintain the same outward pressure)}@}, so {@{the overall fusion rate increases}@}. {@{The higher power output}@} from this shell {@{pushes the higher layers of the star further out}@}. This causes {@{a gradual increase in the radius and consequently luminosity of the star over time}@}. For example, the luminosity of the early Sun was {@{only about 70% of its current value}@}. As a star ages it thus {@{changes its position on the HR diagram}@}. This evolution is reflected in {@{a (up-right) broadening of the main sequence band which contains stars at various evolutionary stages}@}. {@{The initial positions of new-born stars at differing masses}@} is called {@{the _zero-age main sequence_ (_ZAMS_) _line_}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-16,1354,363!2025-11-25,318,283!2028-02-29,849,283!2026-01-13,397,323!2026-11-17,634,323!2026-03-19,150,263!2027-09-26,877,343!2027-11-02,914,343!2027-09-13,874,343!2026-12-18,645,323!2027-01-04,659,323!2026-12-08,607,323!2029-03-12,1326,363!2030-02-11,1590,363!2026-03-08,404,303!2029-12-07,1540,363!2030-03-02,1603,363!2026-01-15,66,346!2025-11-20,17,347!2025-11-20,17,347-->
