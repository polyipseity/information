Informally, the expected value is {@{the [mean](arithmetic%20mean.md) of the possible values a [random variable](random%20variable.md) can take, weighted by the probability of those outcomes}@}.

The expected value of {@{a random variable with a finite number of outcomes}@} is {@{a weighted average of all possible outcomes}@}.

## history

{@{The idea of the expected value}@} originated in {@{the middle of the 17th century from the study of the so-called [problem of points](problem%20of%20points.md)}@}, which {@{seeks to divide the stakes _in a fair way_ between two players}@}, who have to {@{end their game before it is properly finished}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> This problem {@{had been debated for centuries}@}. {@{Many conflicting proposals and solutions had been suggested over the years}@} when it was posed to {@{[Blaise Pascal](Blaise%20Pascal.md) by French writer and amateur mathematician [Chevalier de Méré](Antoine%20Gombaud.md) in 1654}@}. Méré claimed that {@{this problem could not be solved and that it showed just how flawed mathematics was when it came to its application to the real world}@}. Pascal, {@{being a mathematician, was provoked and determined to solve the problem once and for all}@}. <!--SR:!2028-11-02,1092,350!2026-10-16,480,310!2025-12-24,277,330!2025-12-22,276,330!2028-08-15,1027,350!2025-12-28,281,330!2027-12-08,793,307!2026-01-09,290,330!2025-12-11,266,330-->

He {@{began to discuss the problem}@} in {@{the famous series of letters to [Pierre de Fermat](Pierre%20de%20Fermat.md)}@}. Soon enough, they {@{both independently came up with a solution}@}. They {@{solved the problem in different computational ways}@}, but {@{their results were identical because their computations were based on the same fundamental principle}@}. The principle is that {@{the value of a future gain should be directly proportional to the chance of getting it}@}. This principle seemed to {@{have come naturally to both of them}@}. They were {@{very pleased by the fact that they had found essentially the same solution}@}, and this in turn {@{made them absolutely convinced that they had solved the problem conclusively}@}; however, they {@{did not publish their findings}@}. They {@{only informed a small circle of mutual scientific friends in Paris about it}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-03-06,337,347!2025-12-21,276,330!2029-01-18,1154,350!2028-09-07,1047,350!2026-11-20,526,327!2026-03-08,339,347!2025-12-18,273,330!2027-11-30,814,330!2027-11-20,806,330!2025-12-19,274,330!2028-11-05,1094,350-->

In {@{Dutch mathematician [Christiaan Huygens'](Christiaan%20Huygens.md) book}@}, he {@{considered the problem of points}@}, and {@{presented a solution based on the same principle as the solutions of Pascal and Fermat}@}. Huygens published his treatise {@{in 1657, \(see [Huygens \(1657\)](#CITEREFHuygens1657)\) "_De ratiociniis in ludo aleæ_"}@} on {@{probability theory just after visiting Paris}@}. The book {@{extended the concept of expectation}@} by {@{adding rules for how to calculate expectations in more complicated situations than the original problem}@} \(e.g., for {@{three or more players}@}\), and can be seen as {@{the first successful attempt at laying down the foundations of the [theory of probability](probability%20theory.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-09,290,330!2026-01-08,290,330!2026-03-01,306,290!2027-09-26,694,270!2029-01-14,1150,350!2027-11-21,807,330!2027-03-22,565,310!2025-12-21,276,330!2026-02-05,128,393-->

### etymology

{@{Neither Pascal nor Huygens}@} used {@{the term "expectation" in its modern sense}@}. In particular, Huygens writes:<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-11,292,330!2026-01-07,289,330-->

> That any one Chance or Expectation to win any thing is worth just such a Sum, as wou'd procure in the same Chance and Expectation at a fair Lay. ... If I expect a or b, and have an equal chance of gaining them, my Expectation is worth \(a+b\)/2.

More than {@{a hundred years later, in 1814, [Pierre-Simon Laplace](Pierre-Simon%20Laplace.md)}@} published {@{his tract "_Théorie analytique des probabilités_"}@}, where {@{the concept of expected value was defined explicitly}@}:<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2027-08-09,687,290!2026-03-15,345,347!2027-09-27,763,330-->

> ... this advantage in the theory of chance is the product of the sum hoped for by the probability of obtaining it; it is the partial sum which ought to result when we do not wish to run the risks of the event in supposing that the division is made proportional to the probabilities. This division is the only equitable one when all strange circumstances are eliminated; because an equal degree of probability gives an equal right for the sum hoped for. We will call this advantage _mathematical hope._

## notations

{@{The use of the letter E to denote "expected value"}@} goes back to {@{[W. A. Whitworth](William%20Allen%20Whitworth.md) in 1901}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> The symbol has since {@{become popular for English writers}@}. In {@{German, E stands for _Erwartungswert_}@}, in {@{Spanish for _esperanza matemática_}@}, and in {@{French for _espérance mathématique_}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-25,278,330!2027-08-11,690,290!2025-11-22,253,330!2026-11-23,519,310!2027-02-08,504,270!2025-12-21,276,330-->

When {@{"E" is used to denote "expected value"}@}, authors use {@{a variety of stylizations}@}: the expectation operator can be {@{stylized as E \(upright\), _E_ \(italic\), or $\mathbb {E}$ \(in [blackboard bold](blackboard%20bold.md)\)}@}, while a variety of {@{bracket notations \(such as E\(_X_\), E\[_X_\], and E<!-- markdown separator -->_X_\) are all used}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-19,274,330!2025-12-13,268,330!2026-01-06,287,330!2026-01-07,288,330-->

Another popular notation is {@{μ<sub>_X_</sub>}@}. {@{⟨<!-- markdown separator -->_X_<!-- markdown separator -->⟩, ⟨<!-- markdown separator -->_X_<!-- markdown separator -->⟩<sub>av</sub>, and ${\overline {X} }$}@} are commonly used in {@{physics}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> {@{M\(_X_\)}@} is used in {@{Russian-language literature}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-15,345,347!2026-01-12,293,330!2025-12-07,248,327!2026-01-13,294,330!2026-01-06,288,330-->

## definition

As discussed above, there are {@{several context-dependent ways of defining the expected value}@}. The simplest and original definition deals with {@{the case of finitely many possible outcomes, such as in the flip of a coin}@}. With the {@{theory of infinite series}@}, this can be {@{extended to the case of countably many possible outcomes}@}. It is also very common to {@{consider the distinct case of random variables dictated by \(piecewise-\)continuous [probability density functions](probability%20density%20function.md)}@}, as {@{these arise in many natural contexts}@}. All of these specific definitions may be viewed as {@{special cases of the general definition based upon the mathematical tools of [measure theory](measure%20(mathematics).md) and [Lebesgue integration](Lebesgue%20integral.md)}@}, which {@{provide these different contexts}@} with {@{an axiomatic foundation and common language}@}. <!--SR:!2029-01-09,1147,350!2027-10-18,779,330!2025-12-31,283,330!2026-03-14,344,347!2027-03-10,557,310!2026-02-26,330,347!2028-03-13,879,330!2028-02-16,821,330!2025-12-17,26,380-->

### random variables with countably infinitely many outcomes

Informally, the expectation of {@{a random variable with a [countably infinite set](countable%20set.md) of possible outcomes}@} is defined {@{analogously as the weighted average of all possible outcomes}@}, where {@{the weights are given by the probabilities of realizing each given value}@}.

However, there are {@{some subtleties with infinite summation}@}, so {@{the above formula is not suitable as a mathematical definition}@}. In particular, {@{the [Riemann series theorem](Riemann%20series%20theorem.md) of [mathematical analysis](mathematical%20analysis.md)}@} illustrates that {@{the value of certain infinite sums involving positive and negative summands depends on the order in which the summands are given}@}.

{@{A general and mathematically precise formulation of this definition}@} uses {@{[measure theory](measure%20(mathematics).md) and [Lebesgue integration](Lebesgue%20integral.md)}@}, and the corresponding {@{theory of _absolutely continuous random variables_}@} is described in the next section. {@{The density functions of many common distributions}@} are {@{[piecewise continuous](piecewise%20function.md)}@}, and as such the theory is often {@{developed in this restricted setting}@}.<sup>[\[16\]](#^ref-16)</sup> For such functions, it is {@{sufficient to only consider the standard [Riemann integration](Riemann%20integral.md)}@}.

Analogously to the {@{countably-infinite case above}@}, there are {@{subtleties with this expression due to the infinite region of integration}@}.

It is straightforward to compute in this case that {@{$$\int _{a}^{b}xf(x)\,dx=\int _{a}^{b}{\frac {x}{x^{2}+\pi ^{2} } }\,dx={\frac {1}{2} }\ln {\frac {b^{2}+\pi ^{2} }{a^{2}+\pi ^{2} } }.$$}@} {@{The limit of this expression as _a_ → −∞ and _b_ → ∞ does not exist}@}: if {@{the limits are taken so that _a_ = −<!-- markdown separator -->_b_, then the limit is zero}@}, while if {@{the constraint 2<!-- markdown separator -->_a_ = −<!-- markdown separator -->_b_ is taken, then the limit is ln\(2\)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-19,274,330!2026-01-04,286,330!2028-10-05,1069,350!2027-10-20,730,327!2026-06-28,371,290!2025-12-21,276,330!2027-11-25,825,347!2026-03-03,334,347-->

### arbitrary real-valued random variables

{@{All definitions of the expected value}@} may be {@{expressed in the language of [measure theory](measure%20(mathematics).md)}@}. In general, if {@{_X_ is a real-valued [random variable](random%20variable.md) defined on a [probability space](probability%20space.md) \(Ω, Σ, P\)}@}, then the expected value of _X_, denoted by E\[_X_\], is defined as {@{the [Lebesgue integral](Lebesgue%20integral.md)<sup>[\[18\]](#^ref-18)</sup> $$\operatorname {E} [X]=\int _{\Omega }X\,d\operatorname {P} .$$}@} Despite {@{the newly abstract situation}@}, this definition is {@{extremely similar in nature to the very simplest definition of expected values, given above, as certain weighted averages}@}.

### infinite expected values

Expected values as defined above are {@{automatically finite numbers}@}. However, in many cases it is {@{fundamental to be able to consider expected values of ±∞}@}.

There is {@{a rigorous mathematical theory underlying such ideas}@}, which is often {@{taken as part of the definition of the Lebesgue integral}@}.<sup>[\[19\]](#^ref-19)</sup> The first fundamental observation is that, {@{whichever of the above definitions are followed}@}, {@{any _nonnegative_ random variable whatsoever can be given an unambiguous expected value}@}; whenever {@{absolute convergence fails}@}, then {@{the expected value can be defined as +∞}@}. The second fundamental observation is that {@{any random variable can be written as the difference of two nonnegative random variables}@}.

But, {@{$\operatorname {E} [X_{n}]=n\cdot \Pr \left(U\in \left[0,{\tfrac {1}{n} }\right]\right)=n\cdot {\tfrac {1}{n} }=1$ for each $n$}@}.
