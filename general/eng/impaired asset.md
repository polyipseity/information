# impaired asset

In {@{[accounting](accounting.md)}@}, an __impaired asset__ is {@{an [asset](asset.md) which has a [market value](market%20value.md) less than the value listed on its owner's [balance sheet](balance%20sheet.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-15,55,310!2025-06-18,115,290-->

According to {@{U.S. accounting rules \(known as [US GAAP](Generally%20Accepted%20Accounting%20Principles%20(United%20States).md)\)}@}, {@{the value of an asset is impaired}@} when {@{the sum of estimated future [cash flows](cash%20flow.md) from that asset is less than its [book value](book%20value.md)}@}. At this point {@{an impairment loss should be recognized}@}, which is done by {@{taking the difference between the [fair market value](fair%20market%20value.md) \(FMV\) and the book value}@} and {@{recording this amount as the loss}@}. This basically records {@{the asset as if it were being acquired brand new at its FMV, recording this as its new book value}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> This is {@{a common occurrence for [goodwill](goodwill%20(accounting).md)}@} where {@{a company will purchase a target company for more than the value of its net assets}@}. Under {@{US GAAP}@}, goodwill is {@{tested annually for impairment}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-21,60,310!2025-03-24,63,310!2025-06-23,127,290!2025-03-28,66,310!2025-03-16,56,310!2025-03-22,61,310!2025-02-28,40,290!2025-02-28,43,290!2025-03-27,65,310!2025-03-26,64,310!2025-03-23,62,310-->
