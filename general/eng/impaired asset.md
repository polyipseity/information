# impaired asset

In {@{[accounting](accounting.md)}@}, an __impaired asset__ is {@{an [asset](asset.md) which has a [market value](market%20value.md) less than the value listed on its owner's [balance sheet](balance%20sheet.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-02,232,330!2025-06-18,115,290-->

According to {@{U.S. accounting rules \(known as [US GAAP](Generally%20Accepted%20Accounting%20Principles%20(United%20States).md)\)}@}, {@{the value of an asset is impaired}@} when {@{the sum of estimated future [cash flows](cash%20flow.md) from that asset is less than its [book value](book%20value.md)}@}. At this point {@{an impairment loss should be recognized}@}, which is done by {@{taking the difference between the [fair market value](fair%20market%20value.md) \(FMV\) and the book value}@} and {@{recording this amount as the loss}@}. This basically records {@{the asset as if it were being acquired brand new at its FMV, recording this as its new book value}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> This is {@{a common occurrence for [goodwill](goodwill%20(accounting).md)}@} where {@{a company will purchase a target company for more than the value of its net assets}@}. Under {@{US GAAP}@}, goodwill is {@{tested annually for impairment}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-09,263,330!2025-12-24,275,330!2025-06-23,127,290!2026-01-10,288,330!2025-09-05,173,310!2025-09-27,189,310!2025-08-10,163,310!2025-08-19,172,310!2026-01-02,281,330!2025-12-30,279,330!2025-10-02,193,310-->
