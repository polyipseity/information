# Sun

The __Sun__ is {@{the [star](star.md) at the center of the [Solar System](Solar%20System.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-27,284,340-->

- equatorial [radius](radius.md) ::@:: 696&nbsp;300&nbsp;[km](kilometre.md), 432&nbsp;700&nbsp;[mi](mile.md), 109&nbsp;[Earth radii](Earth%20radius.md) <!--SR:!2025-08-19,181,200!2025-08-15,253,280-->
- [luminosity](luminosity.md) ::@:: 3.828×10<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;[W](watt.md), 3.75×10<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;[lm](lumen%20(unit).md), 98&nbsp;lm/W [efficacy](luminous%20efficacy.md) <!--SR:!2025-08-28,171,220!2026-05-22,429,280-->
- [mass](mass.md) ::@:: 1.9885×10<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;[kg](kilogram.md), 4.3839×10<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;[lbs](pound%20(mass).md), 332&nbsp;950&nbsp;[Earths](Earth%20mass.md) <!--SR:!2025-10-14,230,220!2025-06-26,220,280-->

## structure and fusion

- see: [standard solar model](standard%20solar%20model.md)

From the outside to inside, significant structures of the Sun are: {@{[solar wind](solar%20wind.md), [corona](stellar%20corona.md), [chromosphere](chromosphere.md), [photosphere](#photosphere), [convective zone](#convective%20zone), [radiative zone](#radiative%20zone), and [core](#core)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-10,152,240-->

### core

- see: [solar core](solar%20core.md)

The core of the Sun extends {@{from the center to about 20–25% of the [solar radius](solar%20radius.md)}@}. It has a [density](density.md) of {@{up to 150 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (about 150 times the density of [water](water.md))}@} and a temperature of {@{close to 15.7 million [kelvin](Kelvin.md) (K)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-25,252,320!2026-10-03,595,320!2025-07-19,233,280-->

The core is the only region of the Sun that {@{produces an appreciable amount of [thermal energy](thermal%20energy.md) through [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md)}@}; {@{99% of the power is generated within 24% of the Sun's radius, and by 30% of the radius}@}, fusion has stopped nearly entirely. Through most of the Sun's life, energy has been produced by {@{nuclear fusion in the core region through the [proton–proton chain](proton–proton%20chain.md); this process converts [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) into [helium](helium.md)}@}. Currently, only about 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun {@{comes from another sequence of fusion reactions called the [CNO cycle](CNO%20cycle.md), though this proportion is expected to increase as the Sun becomes older and more luminous}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-22,207,320!2026-12-25,651,320!2025-12-03,334,300!2026-07-22,489,300-->

The fusion rate in the core is {@{in a self-correcting equilibrium}@}: a slightly higher rate of fusion would {@{cause the core to heat up more and [expand](thermal%20expansion.md) slightly against the weight of the outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation}@}; and {@{a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-30,232,320!2025-10-25,359,340!2026-04-10,420,300-->

## radiative zone

- see: [radiation zone](radiation%20zone.md)

The radiative zone is the thickest layer of the [Sun](sun.md), {@{at 0.45 [solar radii](solar%20radius.md), extending from the core (0.25 solar radii) out to about 0.7 solar radii}@}. {@{[Thermal radiation](thermal%20radiation.md)}@} is the primary means of energy transfer. The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 1.5 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. <!--SR:!2025-04-28,180,280!2025-10-13,348,340-->

## convective zone

- see: [convection zone](convection%20zone.md)

The Sun's convection zone extends {@{from 0.7 [solar radii](solar%20radius.md) (500&nbsp;000 km) to near the surface}@}. The temperature drops {@{from approximately 1.5 million to 5700 [kelvins](Kelvin.md) with increasing distance from the [core](#core)}@}. In this layer, the solar plasma is {@{not dense or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via [radiation](thermal%20radiation.md)}@}. Instead, the density of the plasma is {@{low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-20,261,300!2027-05-08,753,320!2025-09-17,284,300!2025-06-03,236,320-->

## photosphere

- see: [photosphere](photosphere.md)

{@{The visible surface}@} of the Sun, the photosphere, is {@{the layer below which the Sun becomes [opaque](opacity.md) to [visible light](visible%20light.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-25,331,340!2026-04-07,466,320-->

## motion

- see: [stellar kinematics](stellar%20kinematics.md)

Being {@{part of the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md) galaxy}@}, the Sun with the whole [Solar System](Solar%20System.md), moves in {@{an [orbital](orbit.md) fashion around the galaxy's center of mass at an average speed of 230 km/s (828&nbsp;000 km/h) or 143 mi/s (514&nbsp;000 mph)}@}, taking {@{about 220–250 million [Earth](Earth.md) years to complete a revolution (a Galactic year)}@}, having done so {@{about 20 times since the Sun's formation}@}. The direction of the Sun's motion {@{relative to the [local standard of rest](local%20standard%20of%20rest.md) (so the orbital motion is excluded), the [solar apex](solar%20apex.md), is roughly in the direction of the star [Vega](Vega.md) at about 13.4 km/s}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-18,295,330!2025-05-11,151,210!2027-06-02,816,330!2027-02-11,729,330!2025-06-30,216,250-->
