# Sun

The __Sun__ is {@{the [star](star.md) at the center of the [Solar System](Solar%20System.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-03-17,1329,360-->

- equatorial [radius](radius.md) ::@:: 696&nbsp;300&nbsp;[km](kilometre.md), 432&nbsp;700&nbsp;[mi](mile.md), 109&nbsp;[Earth radii](Earth%20radius.md) <!--SR:!2026-08-16,362,200!2028-05-01,988,300-->
- [luminosity](luminosity.md) ::@:: 3.828×10<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;[W](watt.md), 3.75×10<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;[lm](lumen%20(unit).md), 98&nbsp;lm/W [efficacy](luminous%20efficacy.md) <!--SR:!2026-09-14,382,220!2026-05-22,429,280-->
- [mass](mass.md) ::@:: 1.9885×10<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;[kg](kilogram.md), 4.3839×10<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;[lbs](pound%20(mass).md), 332&nbsp;950&nbsp;[Earths](Earth%20mass.md) <!--SR:!2027-10-01,717,240!2027-10-31,857,300-->

## structure and fusion

- see: [standard solar model](standard%20solar%20model.md)

From the outside to inside, significant structures of the Sun are: {@{[solar wind](solar%20wind.md), [corona](stellar%20corona.md), [chromosphere](chromosphere.md), [photosphere](#photosphere)}@}, {@{[convective zone](#convective%20zone), [radiative zone](#radiative%20zone), and [core](#core)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-25,242,240!2026-04-16,164,354-->

### core

- see: ::@:: [solar core](solar%20core.md)

{@{The core of the Sun}@} extends {@{from the center to about 20–25% of the [solar radius](solar%20radius.md)}@}. It has {@{a [density](density.md)}@} of {@{up to 150 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (about 150 times the density of [water](water.md))}@} and {@{a temperature}@} of {@{close to 15.7 million [kelvin](Kelvin.md) (K)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-07-19,1120,340!2026-10-03,595,320!2028-01-14,909,300-->

{@{The core}@} is {@{the only region of the Sun}@} that produces {@{an appreciable amount of [thermal energy](thermal%20energy.md) through [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md)}@}; {@{99% of the power}@} is {@{generated within 24% of the Sun's radius}@}, and by {@{30% of the radius}@}, fusion has {@{stopped nearly entirely}@}. Through {@{most of the Sun's life}@}, energy has been produced by {@{nuclear fusion in the core region through the [proton–proton chain](proton–proton%20chain.md)}@}; this process {@{converts [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) into [helium](helium.md)}@}. Currently, {@{only about 0.8% of the energy generated}@} in the Sun comes from {@{another sequence of fusion reactions called the [CNO cycle](CNO%20cycle.md)}@}, though this proportion is {@{expected to increase as the Sun becomes older and more luminous}@}. <!--SR:!2027-10-24,915,340!2026-12-25,651,320!2028-08-31,1002,300!2026-07-22,489,300-->

{@{The fusion rate in the core}@} is {@{in a self-correcting equilibrium}@}: {@{a slightly higher rate of fusion}@} would cause {@{the core to heat up more and [expand](thermal%20expansion.md) slightly against the weight of the outer layers}@}, reducing {@{the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation}@}; and {@{a slightly lower rate}@} would cause {@{the core to cool and shrink slightly}@}, increasing {@{the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate}@}. <!--SR:!2028-03-19,1024,340!2026-04-21,178,320!2026-04-10,420,300!2026-01-30,78,356!2026-01-24,73,356!2026-01-29,77,356!2026-01-22,71,356!2026-01-23,72,356-->

## radiative zone

- see: [radiation zone](radiation%20zone.md)

The radiative zone is the thickest layer of the [Sun](sun.md), {@{at 0.45 [solar radii](solar%20radius.md), extending from the core (0.25 solar radii) out to about 0.7 solar radii}@}. {@{[Thermal radiation](thermal%20radiation.md)}@} is the primary means of energy transfer. The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 1.5 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. <!--SR:!2027-03-31,702,300!2030-03-31,1630,360-->

## convective zone

- see: [convection zone](convection%20zone.md)

The Sun's convection zone extends {@{from 0.7 [solar radii](solar%20radius.md) (500&nbsp;000 km) to near the surface}@}. The temperature drops {@{from approximately 1.5 million to 5700 [kelvins](Kelvin.md) with increasing distance from the [core](#core)}@}. In this layer, the solar plasma is {@{not dense or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via [radiation](thermal%20radiation.md)}@}. Instead, the density of the plasma is {@{low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface}@}. <!--SR:!2028-07-12,1087,320!2027-05-08,753,320!2028-12-10,1180,320!2028-04-10,1042,340-->

## photosphere

- see: [photosphere](photosphere.md)

{@{The visible surface}@} of the Sun, the photosphere, is {@{the layer below which the Sun becomes [opaque](opacity.md) to [visible light](visible%20light.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-12-23,1550,360!2026-04-07,466,320-->

## motion

- see: [stellar kinematics](stellar%20kinematics.md)

Being {@{part of the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md) galaxy}@}, the Sun with the whole [Solar System](Solar%20System.md), moves in {@{an [orbital](orbit.md) fashion around the galaxy's center of mass at an average speed of 230 km/s (828&nbsp;000 km/h) or 143 mi/s (514&nbsp;000 mph)}@}, taking {@{about 220–250 million [Earth](Earth.md) years to complete a revolution (a Galactic year)}@}, having done so {@{about 20 times since the Sun's formation}@}. The direction of the Sun's motion {@{relative to the [local standard of rest](local%20standard%20of%20rest.md) (so the orbital motion is excluded), the [solar apex](solar%20apex.md), is roughly in the direction of the star [Vega](Vega.md) at about 13.4 km/s}@}. <!--SR:!2029-03-17,1338,350!2026-08-06,448,230!2027-06-02,816,330!2027-02-11,729,330!2026-12-15,533,250-->
