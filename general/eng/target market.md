## importance

SOM can be treated as a {@{short-term goal, which should be realized by a startup quickly for it to be viable}@}. It is the most important for startups as {@{failing to meet SOM renders SAM and TAM meaningless}@}. If the company is good enough, SOM eventually {@{approaches SAM}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-23,269,330!2025-04-19,265,330!2028-07-31,1201,350-->
