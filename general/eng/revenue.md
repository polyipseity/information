# revenue

In [accounting](accounting.md), __revenue__ is {@{the total amount of income generated by the sale of [goods and services](product%20(business).md) related to the primary operations of the [business](business.md)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {@{Commercial revenue}@} may also be referred to {@{as __sales__ or as __turnover__}@}. Some [companies](company.md) receive revenue from {@{[interest](interest.md), [royalties](royalty%20payment.md), or other [fees](fee.md)}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> "Revenue" may refer to {@{income in general, or it may refer to the amount, in a [monetary unit](currency.md), earned during a period of time, as in "Last year, company X had revenue of $42 million"}@}. {@{[Profits](profit%20(accounting).md) or [net income](net%20income.md)}@} generally imply {@{total revenue minus total expenses in a given period}@}. In [accounting](accounting.md), revenue is {@{a subsection of the equity section of the balance statement, since it increases equity}@}. It is often referred to as {@{the "top line" due to its position at the very top of the [income statement](income%20statement.md)}@}. This is to be contrasted with {@{the "bottom line" which denotes net income (gross revenues minus total expenses)}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-02,289,330!2025-10-12,299,330!2026-10-18,579,330!2026-05-06,436,310!2025-08-07,246,330!2025-09-07,272,330!2025-10-05,292,330!2026-09-10,532,310!2025-10-22,259,270!2025-06-15,188,310-->
