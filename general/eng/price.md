A __price__ is {@{the \(usually not negative\) [quantity](quantity.md) of [payment](payment.md) or [compensation](financial%20compensation.md) expected, required, or given by one [party](party%20(law).md) to another in return for [goods](goods.md) or [services](service%20(economics).md)}@}. In some situations, especially when {@{the product is a service rather than a physical good}@}, the price for the service may be {@{called something else such as "rent" or "tuition"}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> Prices are influenced by {@{production [costs](cost.md), [supply](supply%20(economics).md) of the desired product, and [demand](demand.md) for the product}@}. A price may be determined by {@{a [monopolist](monopoly.md) or may be imposed on the firm by market conditions}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,281,330!2025-11-16,281,330!2025-11-04,270,330!2025-11-11,277,330!2025-08-23,197,310-->

Price can be quoted in {@{currency, quantities of goods or vouchers}@}. <!--SR:!2026-10-29,521,310-->

- In modern [economies](economy.md), prices are generally expressed in ::@:: units of some form of [currency](currency.md). \(More specifically, for [raw materials](raw%20material.md) they are expressed as currency per unit weight, e.g. euros per kilogram or Rands per KG.\) <!--SR:!2027-05-29,706,330!2026-12-15,552,310-->
- Although prices could be [quoted](request%20for%20quotation.md) as quantities of other goods or services, ::@:: this sort of [barter exchange](barter.md) is rarely seen. Prices are sometimes quoted in terms of vouchers such as trading stamps and air miles. <!--SR:!2027-08-19,764,330!2025-11-07,273,330-->
- In some circumstances, cigarettes have been used as ::@:: currency, for example in prisons, in times of [hyperinflation](hyperinflation.md), and in some places during World War II. In a [black market](black%20market.md) economy, [barter](barter.md) is also relatively common. <!--SR:!2026-11-04,523,310!2027-12-11,841,330-->

In {@{many financial transactions}@}, it is {@{customary to quote prices in other ways}@}. The most obvious example is in {@{pricing a loan}@}, when {@{the [cost](cost.md) will be expressed as the percentage rate of interest}@}. {@{The total amount of interest payable}@} depends upon {@{credit risk, the loan amount and the period of the loan}@}. Other examples can be found in {@{pricing financial derivatives and other financial assets}@}. For instance {@{the price of inflation-linked government securities in several countries}@} is quoted as {@{the actual price divided by a factor representing inflation since the security was issued}@}. <!--SR:!2027-11-20,837,330!2025-11-14,279,330!2025-10-29,266,330!2027-05-06,689,330!2025-10-22,260,330!2025-11-18,283,330!2027-09-19,789,330!2026-08-20,471,310!2027-04-13,669,330-->

"Price" sometimes refers to {@{the quantity of payment requested by a seller of goods or services, rather than the eventual payment amount}@}. In business this requested amount is often referred to as {@{the offer price or selling price, while the actual payment may be called transaction price or traded price}@}. <!--SR:!2027-05-24,702,330!2025-11-25,289,330-->

{@{Economic price theory}@} asserts that in {@{a free market economy the [market price](price.md#market%20price) reflects the interaction between [supply and demand](supply%20and%20demand.md)}@}:<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> the price is {@{set so as to equate the quantity being supplied and that being demanded}@}. In turn, these quantities are determined by {@{the [marginal utility](marginal%20utility.md) of the asset to different buyers and to different sellers}@}. {@{Supply and demand, and hence price}@}, may be influenced by {@{other factors, such as government subsidy or manipulation through industry collusion}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-06,209,310!2026-12-01,544,310!2027-10-18,813,330!2025-10-07,248,330!2025-10-23,262,330!2027-04-24,678,330-->

When {@{a [raw material](raw%20material.md) or a similar economic good is for sale at multiple locations}@}, {@{the [law of one price](law%20of%20one%20price.md) is generally believed to hold}@}. This essentially states that {@{the cost difference between the locations cannot be greater than that representing shipping, taxes, other distribution costs and more}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-24,198,310!2025-11-25,289,330!2025-12-01,294,330-->

## functions of prices

According to {@{[Milton Friedman](Milton%20Friedman.md)}@}, price has {@{__five functions__ in a __free-enterprise exchange economy__}@} which is {@{characterized by private ownership of the means of production}@}:<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-12-06,548,310!2025-11-19,284,330!2027-10-17,801,330-->

- __Providing__ an incentive for enterprise ::@:: \(a\) to produce those products valued most highly by the market, and \(b\) to use methods of production that economize relatively scarce factors of production. <!--SR:!2027-11-19,824,330!2027-08-28,774,330-->

- __Rationing__ ::@:: fixed supplies of goods among consumers. <!--SR:!2025-09-06,208,310!2025-11-25,289,330-->

## price and value

{@{The [paradox of value](paradox%20of%20value.md)}@} was {@{observed and debated by [classical economists](classical%20economics.md)}@}. {@{[Adam Smith](Adam%20Smith.md)}@} described {@{what is now called the _diamond – water paradox_: diamonds command a higher price than water, yet water is essential for life and diamonds are merely ornamentation}@}. {@{[Use value](use%20value.md)}@} was supposed to {@{give some measure of usefulness, later refined as [marginal benefit](marginal%20utility.md)}@} while {@{[exchange value](exchange%20value.md)}@} was {@{the measure of how much one good was in terms of another, namely what is now called [relative price](relative%20price.md)}@}.<!-- <sup>\[_[dubious](Wikipedia:Accuracy%20dispute.md#disputed%20statement) – [discuss](Talk:Price.md#dubious)_\]</sup> --> <!--SR:!2025-11-15,280,330!2025-11-30,293,330!2025-11-14,280,330!2025-12-01,294,330!2025-11-14,279,330!2025-11-26,290,330!2025-11-26,290,330!2026-07-02,441,310-->

### negative prices

- see: [negative pricing](negative%20pricing.md), [2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war](2020%20Russia–Saudi%20Arabia%20oil%20price%20war.md)

{@{[Negative prices](negative%20pricing.md)}@} are {@{very unusual but possible under certain circumstances}@}. Effectively, {@{the owner or producer of an item pays the "buyer" to take it off their hands}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-15,256,330!2025-11-06,272,330!2025-11-26,290,330-->

In {@{April 2020, for the first time in history}@}, due to {@{the global health/economic crisis situation}@}, {@{the price of [West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude oil](West%20Texas%20Intermediate.md) for May delivery contracts turned negative}@}, with a barrel of oil at -\$37.63 a barrel, a one-day drop of \$55.90, or 306%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. "Negative prices means {@{someone with a long position in oil would have to pay someone to take that oil off of their hands}@}. Why would they do that? The main reason is {@{a fear that if forced to take delivery of crude on the expiration of the May oil [contract](futures%20contract.md)}@}, there {@{would be nowhere to put it as a glut of crude fills up available storage}@}."<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> In a sense {@{the price is still positive}@}, just {@{the direction of payment reverses, i.e. in this case you are paid to take some [goods](goods.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-12-08,551,310!2025-11-20,285,330!2026-02-05,317,290!2025-11-08,276,330!2025-09-04,206,310!2025-11-25,289,330!2027-10-12,809,330!2025-10-25,263,330-->

{@{[Negative interest rates](interest%20rate.md#negative%20interest%20rates)}@} are {@{a similar concept}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-30,293,330!2027-08-02,751,330-->

## Austrian School theory

{@{One solution offered to the paradox of the value}@} is through {@{the theory of marginal utility proposed by [Carl Menger](Carl%20Menger.md)}@}, one of {@{the founders of the [Austrian School](Austrian%20school%20of%20economics.md) of economics}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-05,272,330!2025-11-08,274,330!2025-12-01,294,330-->

As {@{William Barber}@} put it, {@{human volition, the human subject}@}, was {@{"brought to the centre of the stage" by [marginalist economics](marginalism.md), as a bargaining tool}@}. {@{Neoclassical economists}@} sought to {@{clarify choices open to producers and consumers in market situations}@}, and thus "fears that {@{cleavages in the economic structure might be unbridgeable could be suppressed}@}".<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-30,293,330!2027-09-05,777,330!2025-11-05,271,330!2025-12-01,294,330!2027-10-15,814,330!2026-08-24,475,310-->

Without {@{denying the applicability of the Austrian theory of value as _subjective_ only}@}, within {@{certain contexts of price behavior}@}, {@{the Polish economist [Oskar Lange](Oskar%20R.%20Lange.md)}@} felt {@{it was necessary to attempt a serious _integration_ of the insights of classical political economy with neo-classical economics}@}. This would then result in {@{a much more realistic theory of price and of real behavior in response to prices}@}. {@{Marginalist theory}@} lacked {@{anything like a theory of the social framework of real market functioning}@}, and criticism sparked off by {@{the [capital controversy](Cambridge%20capital%20controversy.md) initiated by [Piero Sraffa](Piero%20Sraffa.md)}@} revealed that {@{most of the foundational tenets of the marginalist theory of value either reduced to [tautologies](tautology%20(logic).md)}@}, or that {@{the theory was true only if counter-factual conditions applied}@}.<!-- <sup>\[_[citation needed](Wikipedia:Citation%20needed.md)_\]</sup> --> <!--SR:!2027-05-16,694,330!2025-12-01,294,330!2026-07-12,449,310!2025-11-12,278,330!2025-11-30,293,330!2025-11-25,289,330!2025-08-30,203,310!2025-11-09,227,270!2025-12-01,294,330!2025-11-20,285,330-->

{@{One insight often ignored in the debates about price theory}@} is {@{something that businessmen are keenly aware of}@}: in {@{different markets}@}, prices {@{may not function according to the same principles except in some very abstract \(and therefore not very useful\) sense}@}. From {@{the classical political economists to [Michał Kalecki](Michał%20Kalecki.md)}@} it was known that {@{prices for industrial goods behaved differently from prices for agricultural goods}@}, but {@{this idea could be extended further to other broad classes of goods and services}@}.<!-- <sup>\[_[citation needed](Wikipedia:Citation%20needed.md)_\]</sup> --> <!--SR:!2025-11-26,290,330!2025-11-09,275,330!2025-11-30,293,330!2027-04-24,610,310!2025-10-28,266,330!2025-11-08,275,330!2025-12-01,294,330-->

## price as productive human labour time

{@{Marxists}@} assert that {@{[value](value%20(economics).md#theories) derives from the volume of [socially necessary labour time](socially%20necessary%20labour%20time.md) exerted in the creation of an object}@}. This value does not {@{relate to price in a simple manner}@}, and the difficulty of {@{the conversion of the mass of values into the actual prices is known as the [transformation problem](transformation%20problem.md)}@}. However, {@{many recent Marxists deny that any problem exists}@}. Marx was {@{not concerned with proving that prices derive from values}@}. In fact, he {@{admonished the other classical political economists \(like Ricardo and Smith\) for trying to make this proof}@}. Rather, for Marx, price equals {@{the cost of production \(capital-cost and labor-costs\) plus the average [rate of profit](rate%20of%20profit.md)}@}. So if {@{the average rate of profit \(return on capital investment\) is 22%}@} then {@{prices would reflect cost-of-production plus 22%}@}. {@{The perception that there is a transformation problem in Marx}@} stems from {@{the injection of [Walrasian equilibrium theory](competitive%20equilibrium.md) into Marxism where there is no such thing as equilibrium}@}.<!-- <sup>\[_[citation needed](Wikipedia:Citation%20needed.md)_\]</sup> --> <!--SR:!2025-10-21,259,330!2027-10-17,812,330!2025-10-31,268,330!2025-10-09,250,330!2025-11-17,282,330!2025-11-30,293,330!2027-04-09,665,330!2027-05-12,690,330!2027-06-26,727,330!2025-11-08,274,330!2025-11-15,281,330!2026-08-22,473,310-->

## confusion between prices and costs of production

Price is {@{commonly confused with the notion of cost of production}@}, as in {@{"I paid a high <u>cost</u> for <u>buying</u> my new plasma television"}@}; but {@{technically these are different concepts}@}. Price is {@{what a buyer pays to acquire products from a seller}@}. Cost of production concerns {@{the seller's expenses \(e.g., manufacturing expense\) in producing the product being exchanged with a buyer}@}. For {@{[marketing](marketing.md) organizations seeking to make a profit}@}, the hope is that {@{price will exceed cost of production so that the organization can see financial gain from the transaction}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-26,290,330!2025-11-26,290,330!2025-10-13,255,330!2027-10-19,813,330!2026-04-20,348,290!2025-10-23,261,330!2025-11-26,290,330-->

Finally, while {@{pricing is a topic central to a company's profitability}@}, pricing decisions are {@{not limited to for-profit companies}@}. {@{The behavior of [non-profit organizations](nonprofit%20organization.md), such as charities, educational institutions and industry trade groups}@}, also {@{involves setting prices}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup><sup>[\[160\]](#^ref-160)</sup> For instance, {@{charities seeking to raise money}@} may {@{set different "target" levels for donations that reward donors with increases in status \(e.g., name in newsletter\), gifts or other benefits}@}; likewise {@{educational and cultural nonprofits}@} often {@{price seats for events in theatres, auditoriums and stadiums}@}. Furthermore, while {@{nonprofit organizations may not earn a "profit", by definition}@}, it is the case that {@{many nonprofits may desire to maximize _net revenue_—total revenue less total cost}@}—for {@{various programs and activities, such as selling seats to theatrical and cultural performances}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup><sup>[\[183\]](#^ref-183)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-25,289,330!2025-10-30,267,330!2025-11-13,278,330!2025-10-17,257,330!2025-11-10,276,330!2026-12-27,564,310!2025-10-13,253,330!2027-09-13,773,330!2025-11-26,290,330!2025-09-07,209,310!2026-12-05,549,310-->

## price point

{@{The price of an item}@} is also {@{called the "price point", especially if it refers to stores that set a limited number of price points}@}. For example, {@{[Dollar General](Dollar%20General.md)}@} is {@{a [general store](general%20store.md) or "[five and dime](variety%20store.md#FiveAndTen)" store}@} that {@{sets price points only at even amounts, such as exactly one, two, three, five, or ten [dollars](dollar.md) \(among others\)}@}. Other stores have {@{a policy of setting most of their prices ending in 99 cents or pence}@}. Other stores \(such as {@{[dollar stores](variety%20store.md), [pound](pound%20sterling.md) stores, [euro](euro.md) stores, 100-[yen](japanese%20yen.md) stores, and so forth}@}\) only have {@{a single price point \(\$1, £1, €1, ¥100\), but in some cases, that price may purchase more than one of some very small items}@}. <sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> The term "[price point](price%20point.md)" is also used to {@{describe non-linear areas of the price curve}@}. <!--SR:!2027-10-20,814,330!2025-11-26,290,330!2026-11-17,536,310!2025-11-26,290,330!2025-11-13,279,330!2025-10-24,263,330!2025-09-01,205,310!2027-11-19,837,330!2025-11-26,290,330-->

## market price

In [economics](economics.md), {@{the __market price__}@} is {@{the economic price for which a [good](goods.md) or [service](service%20(economics).md) is offered in the [marketplace](marketplace.md)}@}. It is of interest mainly in {@{the study of [microeconomics](microeconomics.md)}@}. {@{[Market value](market%20value.md) and market price}@} are {@{equal only under conditions of [market efficiency](efficient-market%20hypothesis.md), [equilibrium](economic%20equilibrium.md), and [rational expectations](rational%20expectations.md)}@}. Market price is measured {@{during a specific period of time and is greatly affected by the supply and demand for a good or service}@}. For example, if {@{demand for a good increases and supply of the good is held constant}@}, {@{the price for the good will rise in a marketplace with open competition}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2027-09-25,794,330!2025-11-09,276,330!2025-12-01,294,330!2025-11-08,275,330!2025-10-27,264,330!2025-11-26,290,330!2025-11-07,274,330!2025-11-30,293,330-->

Under {@{the UK's [Sale of Goods Act 1979](Sale%20of%20Goods%20Act%201979.md)}@}, {@{[damages](damages.md) for non-delivery of contracted goods}@} take account of {@{the market price for the goods where there is an available market}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-09-02,206,310!2026-09-25,499,310!2025-10-26,263,330-->

On {@{[restaurant](restaurant.md) [menus](menu.md)}@}, {@{the market price \(often abbreviated to _m.p._ or _mp_\)}@} is {@{written instead of a specific price, meaning "price of dish depends on market price of ingredients, and price is available upon request"}@}, and is particularly used for {@{[seafood](seafood.md), notably [lobsters](lobster.md) and [oysters](oyster.md)}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-17,282,330!2025-10-03,245,330!2027-10-15,812,330!2025-08-25,199,310-->

## other terms
