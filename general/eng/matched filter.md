# matched filter

In {@{[signal processing](signal%20processing.md)}@}, {@{the output of the __matched filter__}@} is given by {@{[correlating](cross-correlation.md) a known delayed [signal](signal%20(electrical%20engineering).md), or _template_, with an unknown signal to detect the presence of the template in the unknown signal}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> This is equivalent to {@{[convolving](convolution.md) the unknown signal with a [conjugated](complex%20conjugate.md) time-reversed version of the template}@}. The matched filter is {@{the optimal [linear filter](linear%20filter.md) for maximizing the [signal-to-noise ratio](signal-to-noise%20ratio.md) \(SNR\)}@} in {@{the presence of additive [stochastic](stochastic%20process.md) [noise](noise%20(signal%20processing).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290-->

Matched filters are commonly used in {@{[radar](radar.md)}@}, in which {@{a known signal is sent out, and the reflected signal is examined for common elements of the out-going signal}@}. {@{[Pulse compression](pulse%20compression.md)}@} is an example of matched filtering. It is so called because {@{the impulse response is matched to input pulse signals}@}. {@{Two-dimensional matched filters}@} are commonly used in {@{[image processing](image%20processing.md), e.g., to improve the SNR of X-ray observations}@}. Additional applications of note are in {@{[seismology](seismology.md) and [gravitational-wave astronomy](gravitational-wave%20astronomy.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290-->

Matched filtering is {@{a demodulation technique with [LTI \(linear time invariant\) filters](linear%20filter.md)}@} to {@{maximize SNR}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> It was originally also known as {@{a _North filter_}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290-->

## derivation

### derivation via matrix algebra

The following section derives {@{the matched filter for a [discrete-time system](discrete-time%20system.md)}@}. {@{The derivation for a [continuous-time system](continuous-time.md#continuous%20time)}@} is similar, with {@{summations replaced with integrals}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309-->

The matched filter is {@{the linear filter, $h$, that maximizes the output [signal-to-noise ratio](signal-to-noise%20ratio.md)}@}. {@{$$\ y[n]=\sum _{k=-\infty }^{\infty }h[n-k]x[k],$$}@} where $x[k]$ is {@{the input as a function of the independent variable $k$}@}, and $y[n]$ is {@{the filtered output}@}. Though we most often express {@{filters as the [impulse response](impulse%20response.md) of convolution systems}@}, as above \(see {@{[LTI system theory](LTI%20system%20theory.md)}@}\), it is easiest to think of {@{the matched filter in the context of the [inner product](inner%20product.md)}@}, which we will see shortly. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290-->

We can derive {@{the linear filter that maximizes output signal-to-noise ratio}@} by invoking {@{a geometric argument}@}. {@{The intuition behind the matched filter}@} relies on correlating {@{the received signal \(a vector\) with a filter \(another vector\) that is parallel with the signal}@}, maximizing {@{the inner product}@}. This {@{enhances the signal}@}. When we consider {@{the additive stochastic noise}@}, we have the additional challenge of {@{minimizing the output due to noise}@} by choosing a filter that is {@{orthogonal to the noise}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309-->

Let us formally define {@{the problem}@}. We seek {@{a filter, $h$}@}, such that we {@{maximize the output signal-to-noise ratio}@}, where the output is {@{the inner product of the filter and the observed signal $x$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290-->

{@{Our observed signal}@} consists of {@{the desirable signal $s$ and additive noise $v$}@}: {@{$$\ x=s+v.\,$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290-->

Let us define {@{the [auto-correlation matrix](autocorrelation.md) of the noise}@}, reminding ourselves that this matrix has {@{[Hermitian symmetry](Hermitian%20matrix.md), a property that will become useful in the derivation}@}: {@{$$\ R_{v}=E\{vv^{\mathrm {H} }\}\,$$}@} where $v^{\mathrm {H} }$ denotes {@{the [conjugate transpose](conjugate%20transpose.md) of $v$}@}, and $E$ denotes {@{[expectation](expected%20value.md)}@} \(note that in case {@{the noise $v$ has zero-mean}@}, {@{its auto-correlation matrix $R_{v}$}@} is equal to {@{its [covariance matrix](covariance%20matrix.md)}@}\). (annotation: $R_v$ is {@{positive semidefinite}@}. Later, we assume {@{$R_v$ is invertible, implying its positive definiteness}@}.) <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290-->

Let us call {@{our output, $y$}@}, {@{the inner product of our filter and the observed signal}@} such that {@{$$\ y=\sum _{k=-\infty }^{\infty }h^{*}[k]x[k]=h^{\mathrm {H} }x=h^{\mathrm {H} }s+h^{\mathrm {H} }v=y_{s}+y_{v}.$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-03-18,39,290-->

We now define {@{the signal-to-noise ratio, which is our objective function}@}, to be {@{the ratio of the power of the output due to the desired signal to the power of the output due to the noise}@}: {@{$$\mathrm {SNR} ={\frac {|y_{s}|^{2} }{E\{|y_{v}|^{2}\} } }.$$}@} We {@{rewrite the above}@}: {@{$$\mathrm {SNR} ={\frac {|h^{\mathrm {H} }s|^{2} }{E\{|h^{\mathrm {H} }v|^{2}\} } }.$$}@} We wish to {@{maximize this quantity by choosing $h$}@}. Expanding {@{the denominator of our objective function}@}, we have {@{$$\ E\{|h^{\mathrm {H} }v|^{2}\}=E\{(h^{\mathrm {H} }v){(h^{\mathrm {H} }v)}^{\mathrm {H} }\}=h^{\mathrm {H} }E\{vv^{\mathrm {H} }\}h=h^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}h.\,$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-09,12,270-->

Now, {@{our $\mathrm {SNR}$}@} becomes {@{$$\mathrm {SNR} ={\frac {|h^{\mathrm {H} }s|^{2} }{h^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}h} }.$$}@} We will rewrite {@{this expression with some matrix manipulation}@}. {@{The reason for this seemingly counterproductive measure}@} will become evident shortly. Exploiting {@{the [Hermitian symmetry](hermitian%20function.md) of the auto-correlation matrix $R_{v}$}@} (annotation: and further assuming {@{$R_v$ is invertible, implying its positive definiteness}@}), we can write {@{$$\mathrm {SNR} ={\frac {|{(R_{v}^{1/2}h)}^{\mathrm {H} }(R_{v}^{-1/2}s)|^{2} }{ {(R_{v}^{1/2}h)}^{\mathrm {H} }(R_{v}^{1/2}h)} },$$}@} \(annotation: Since {@{$R_v$ has Hermitian symmetry}@}, it can be {@{diagonalized by a unitary matrix}@}: {@{$R_v = U D U^{\mathrm H}$}@}. Thus {@{a not-necessary-unique square root can be obtained}@}: {@{$R_v^{1/2} = U \sqrt{D} U^{\mathrm H}$}@}, which itself also {@{has Hermitian symmetry}@}.\) <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-09,12,270!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309-->

We would like to find {@{an upper bound on this expression}@}. To do so, we first recognize {@{a form of the [Cauchy–Schwarz inequality](Cauchy–Schwarz%20inequality.md)}@}: {@{$$\ |a^{\mathrm {H} }b|^{2}\leq (a^{\mathrm {H} }a)(b^{\mathrm {H} }b),\,$$}@} which is to say that {@{the square of the inner product of two vectors}@} can only be {@{as large as the product of the individual inner products of the vectors}@}. This concept returns to {@{the intuition behind the matched filter}@}: {@{this upper bound}@} is achieved when {@{the two vectors $a$ and $b$ are parallel}@}. We resume our derivation by expressing {@{the upper bound on our $\mathrm {SNR}$ in light of the geometric inequality above}@}: {@{$$\mathrm {SNR} ={\frac {|{(R_{v}^{1/2}h)}^{\mathrm {H} }(R_{v}^{-1/2}s)|^{2} }{ {(R_{v}^{1/2}h)}^{\mathrm {H} }(R_{v}^{1/2}h)} }\leq {\frac {\left[{(R_{v}^{1/2}h)}^{\mathrm {H} }(R_{v}^{1/2}h)\right]\left[{(R_{v}^{-1/2}s)}^{\mathrm {H} }(R_{v}^{-1/2}s)\right]}{ {(R_{v}^{1/2}h)}^{\mathrm {H} }(R_{v}^{1/2}h)} }.$$}@} Our valiant matrix manipulation has {@{now paid off}@}. We see that {@{the expression for our upper bound can be greatly simplified}@}: {@{$$\mathrm {SNR} ={\frac {|{(R_{v}^{1/2}h)}^{\mathrm {H} }(R_{v}^{-1/2}s)|^{2} }{ {(R_{v}^{1/2}h)}^{\mathrm {H} }(R_{v}^{1/2}h)} }\leq s^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}^{-1}s.$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-10,13,289!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290-->

We can {@{achieve this upper bound}@} if we choose, {@{$$\ R_{v}^{1/2}h=\alpha R_{v}^{-1/2}s$$}@} where {@{$\alpha$ is an arbitrary [real number](real%20number.md)}@}. To verify this, we plug into {@{our expression for the output $\mathrm {SNR}$}@}: {@{$$\mathrm {SNR} ={\frac {|{(R_{v}^{1/2}h)}^{\mathrm {H} }(R_{v}^{-1/2}s)|^{2} }{ {(R_{v}^{1/2}h)}^{\mathrm {H} }(R_{v}^{1/2}h)} }={\frac {\alpha ^{2}|{(R_{v}^{-1/2}s)}^{\mathrm {H} }(R_{v}^{-1/2}s)|^{2} }{\alpha ^{2}{(R_{v}^{-1/2}s)}^{\mathrm {H} }(R_{v}^{-1/2}s)} }={\frac {|s^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}^{-1}s|^{2} }{s^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}^{-1}s} }=s^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}^{-1}s.$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-09,12,270-->

Thus, {@{our optimal matched filter}@} is {@{$$\ h=\alpha R_{v}^{-1}s.$$}@} We often choose to normalize {@{the expected value of the power of the filter output due to the noise to unity}@}. That is, we constrain {@{$$\ E\{|y_{v}|^{2}\}=1.\,$$}@} This constraint implies {@{a value of $\alpha$}@}, for which we can solve: {@{$$\ E\{|y_{v}|^{2}\}=\alpha ^{2}s^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}^{-1}s=1,$$}@} yielding {@{$$\ \alpha ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {s^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}^{-1}s} } },$$}@} giving us {@{our normalized filter}@}, {@{$$\ h={\frac {1}{\sqrt {s^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}^{-1}s} } }R_{v}^{-1}s.$$}@} \(annotation: Recall that $h$ is defined {@{to be the _inner product_}@}, which is {@{similar but not equivalent to the _impulse response_}@}.\) If we care to write {@{the impulse response $h$ of the filter for the convolution system}@}, it is simply {@{the [complex conjugate](complex%20conjugate.md) time reversal of the input $s$}@}. \(annotation: Correspondingly $h$ is redefined {@{to be the _impulse response_}@} instead.\) <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-03-18,39,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309-->

Though we have derived {@{the matched filter in discrete time}@}, we can extend {@{the concept to continuous-time systems}@} if we replace {@{$R_{v}$ with the continuous-time [autocorrelation](autocorrelation.md) function of the noise}@}, assuming {@{a continuous signal $s(t)$, continuous noise $v(t)$, and a continuous filter $h(t)$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309-->

### derivation via Lagrangian

Alternatively, we may solve for {@{the matched filter}@} by solving {@{our maximization problem with a [Lagrangian](Lagrangian%20mechanics.md)}@}. Again, the matched filter endeavors to {@{maximize the output signal-to-noise ratio \($\mathrm {SNR}$\) of a filtered deterministic signal}@} in {@{[stochastic](stochastic.md) additive noise}@}. {@{The observed sequence}@}, again, is {@{$$\ x=s+v,\,$$}@} with {@{the noise auto-correlation matrix, $$\ R_{v}=E\{vv^{\mathrm {H} }\}.\,$$}@} {@{The signal-to-noise ratio}@} is {@{$$\mathrm {SNR} ={\frac {|y_{s}|^{2} }{E\{|y_{v}|^{2}\} } },$$}@} where {@{$y_{s}=h^{\mathrm {H} }s$ and $y_{v}=h^{\mathrm {H} }v$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309-->

Evaluating {@{the expression in the numerator}@}, we have {@{$$\ |y_{s}|^{2}={y_{s} }^{\mathrm {H} }y_{s}=h^{\mathrm {H} }ss^{\mathrm {H} }h.\,$$}@} and in {@{the denominator}@}, {@{$$\ E\{|y_{v}|^{2}\}=E\{ {y_{v} }^{\mathrm {H} }y_{v}\}=E\{h^{\mathrm {H} }vv^{\mathrm {H} }h\}=h^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}h.\,$$}@} {@{The signal-to-noise ratio}@} becomes {@{$$\mathrm {SNR} ={\frac {h^{\mathrm {H} }ss^{\mathrm {H} }h}{h^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}h} }.$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290-->

If we now constrain {@{the denominator to be 1}@}, {@{the problem of maximizing $\mathrm {SNR}$}@} is reduced {@{to maximizing the numerator}@}. We can then formulate {@{the problem using a [Lagrange multiplier](Lagrange%20multipliers.md)}@}: {@{$$\ h^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}h=1$$ <br/> $$\ {\mathcal {L} }=h^{\mathrm {H} }ss^{\mathrm {H} }h+\lambda (1-h^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}h)$$}@} <br/> {@{$$\ \nabla _{h^{*} }{\mathcal {L} }=ss^{\mathrm {H} }h-\lambda R_{v}h=0$$ <br/> $$\ (ss^{\mathrm {H} })h=\lambda R_{v}h$$}@} which we recognize as {@{a _generalized eigenvalue problem_}@} (annotation: such a problem has {@{the form $\mathbf A \mathbf x = \lambda \mathbf B \mathbf x$}@}) {@{$$\ h^{\mathrm {H} }(ss^{\mathrm {H} })h=\lambda h^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}h.$$}@} Since $ss^{\mathrm {H} }$ is {@{of unit rank (annotation: as the outer product of $s$ with itself)}@}, it has {@{only one nonzero eigenvalue}@}. It can be shown that {@{this eigenvalue equals $$\ \lambda _{\max }=s^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}^{-1}s,$$}@} (annotation: Apply {@{the constraint $h^{\mathrm H} R_v h = 1$}@} to obtain {@{$\lambda = h^{\mathrm H}(ss^{\mathrm H})h = \lvert s^{\mathrm H}h \rvert^2 \ge 0$}@}. To {@{maximize $\lambda$}@}, maximize {@{the component of $h$ in the direction of $s$}@}. This does _not_ {@{imply $h$ must be parallel to $s$ because the constraint is on a _transformed_ $h$}@}: {@{$h^{\mathrm H} R_v h = \lvert R_v^{1 / 2} h \rvert^2 = 1$ using the Hermitian symmetry property of $R_v$}@}. Using {@{a different approach}@}, assume {@{the optimal solution $\lambda_{\max} \ge 0$ has been found}@}. Additionally assuming {@{$R_v$ is invertible, implying its positive definiteness}@}, then we see {@{$(ss^{\mathrm H})h^* = \lambda_{\max} R_v h^* \implies s \sqrt{\lambda_{\max} } = \lambda_{\max} R_v h^* \implies h^* = \frac {R_v^{-1} s} {\sqrt{\lambda_{\max} } }$}@}. Finally, {@{$\lambda_{\max} = \lvert s^{\mathrm H} h^* \rvert^2 = \frac {\lvert s^{\mathrm H} R_v^{-1} s \rvert^2} {\lambda_{\max} } = s^{\mathrm H} R_v^{-1} s$}@}, where the absolute sign is {@{dropped since $R_v$ is positive (semi)definite}@}. {@{Finding the optimal matched filter $h^*$}@} easily follows.) yielding {@{the following optimal matched filter}@} {@{$$\ h={\frac {1}{\sqrt {s^{\mathrm {H} }R_{v}^{-1}s} } }R_{v}^{-1}s.$$}@} This is {@{the same result found in the previous subsection}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-03-19,39,290!2026-03-22,42,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-10,13,289!2026-03-18,39,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290-->

Once again, let {@{the observed sequence}@} be defined as {@{$$\ x_{k}=s_{k}+v_{k},\,$$}@} where $v_{k}$ is {@{uncorrelated zero mean noise}@}. {@{The signal $s_{k}$}@} is assumed to be {@{a scaled and shifted version of a known model sequence $f_{k}$}@}: {@{$$\ s_{k}=\mu _{0}\cdot f_{k-j_{0} }$$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309-->

We want to find {@{optimal estimates $j^{*}$ and $\mu ^{*}$ for the unknown shift $j_{0}$ and scaling $\mu _{0}$}@} by minimizing {@{the least-squares residual between the observed sequence $x_{k}$ and a "probing sequence" $h_{j-k}$}@}: (annotation: {@{A better interpretation}@} of the "probing sequence" is that {@{$h_k$ is the filter impulse response, and $j$ is the time when the filter is applied}@}.) {@{$$\ j^{*},\mu ^{*}=\arg \min _{j,\mu }\sum _{k}\left(x_{k}-\mu \cdot h_{j-k}\right)^{2}$$}@} {@{The appropriate $h_{j-k}$}@} will later {@{turn out to be the matched filter, but is as yet unspecified}@}.

### implications

The matched filter may be derived {@{in a variety of ways}@},<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> but as {@{a special case of a [least-squares procedure](least%20squares.md)}@} it may also be interpreted as {@{a [maximum likelihood](maximum%20likelihood.md) method in the context of a \(coloured\) [Gaussian noise](gaussian%20noise.md) model and the associated [Whittle likelihood](Whittle%20likelihood.md)}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> If the transmitted signal {@{possessed _no_ unknown parameters \(like time-of-arrival, amplitude,...\)}@}, then the matched filter would, according to {@{the [Neyman–Pearson lemma](Neyman–Pearson%20lemma.md), minimize the error probability}@}. However, since the exact signal generally is {@{determined by unknown parameters that effectively are estimated \(or _fitted_\) in the filtering process}@}, the matched filter constitutes {@{a _generalized maximum likelihood_ \(test-\) statistic}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> {@{The filtered [time series](time%20series.md)}@} may then be interpreted as {@{\(proportional to\) the [profile likelihood](profile%20likelihood.md#profile%20likelihood)}@}, {@{the maximized conditional likelihood as a function of the \("arrival"\) time parameter}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> This implies in particular that {@{the [error probability](type%20I%20and%20type%20II%20errors.md) \(in the sense of Neyman and Pearson, i.e., concerning maximization of the detection probability for a given false-alarm probability<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup>\)}@} is {@{not necessarily optimal}@}. What is commonly referred to as {@{the _[Signal-to-noise ratio \(SNR\)](signal-to-noise%20ratio.md)_}@}, which is supposed to be {@{maximized by a matched filter}@}, in this context corresponds to {@{${\sqrt {2\log({\mathcal {L} })} }$}@}, where ${\mathcal {L} }$ is {@{the \(conditionally\) maximized likelihood ratio}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <sup>[\[nb 1\]](#^ref-nb%201)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309-->

{@{The construction of the matched filter}@} is based on {@{a _known_ [noise spectrum](power%20spectral%20density.md#power%20spectral%20density)}@}. In practice, however, the noise spectrum is {@{usually [estimated](spectral%20density%20estimation.md) from data and hence only known up to a limited precision}@}. For {@{the case of an uncertain spectrum}@}, the matched filter may be generalized to {@{a more robust iterative procedure with favourable properties also in non-Gaussian noise}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309-->

## frequency-domain interpretation

When viewed in {@{the [frequency domain](frequency%20domain.md)}@}, it is evident that the matched filter applies {@{the greatest weighting to spectral components exhibiting the greatest signal-to-noise ratio}@} \(i.e., {@{large weight where noise is relatively low, and vice versa}@}\). In general this requires {@{a non-flat [frequency response](frequency%20response.md)}@}, but {@{the associated "distortion"}@} is no cause for {@{concern in situations such as [radar](radar.md) and [digital communications](digital%20communications.md)}@}, where {@{the original waveform is known and the objective is the detection of this signal against the background noise}@} (annotation: rather than {@{finding its amplitude or time delay}@}). On {@{the technical side}@}, the matched filter is {@{a _[weighted least-squares](weighted%20least%20squares.md)_ method based on the \([heteroscedastic](heteroscedasticity.md)\) frequency-domain data}@} \(where the "weights" are determined {@{via the noise spectrum}@}, see also previous section\), or equivalently, {@{a _least-squares_ method applied to the [whitened](whitening%20transformation.md) data}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290-->

## examples

### radar and sonar

Matched filters are often used in {@{[signal detection](detection%20theory.md)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> As an example, suppose that we wish to judge {@{the distance of an object by reflecting a signal off it}@}. We may choose to transmit {@{a pure-tone sinusoid at 1 Hz}@}. We assume that our received signal is {@{an attenuated and phase-shifted form of the transmitted signal with added noise}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-03-22,42,309!2026-02-13,16,290-->

To judge {@{the distance of the object}@}, we correlate {@{the received signal with a matched filter}@}, which, in the case of {@{[white \(uncorrelated\) noise](white%20noise.md)}@}, is {@{another pure-tone 1-Hz sinusoid}@}. When {@{the output of the matched filter system exceeds a certain threshold}@}, we conclude {@{[with high probability](with%20high%20probability.md) that the received signal has been reflected off the object}@}. Using {@{the speed of propagation and the time that we first observe the reflected signal}@}, we can estimate {@{the distance of the object}@}. If we change {@{the shape of the pulse in a specially designed way}@}, {@{the signal-to-noise ratio and the distance resolution}@} can be {@{even improved after matched filtering}@}: this is a technique known as {@{[pulse compression](pulse%20compression.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290-->

Additionally, matched filters can be used in {@{parameter estimation problems \(see [estimation theory](estimation%20theory.md)\)}@}. To return to our previous example, we may desire to estimate {@{the speed of the object, in addition to its position}@}. To exploit {@{the [Doppler effect](Doppler%20effect.md)}@}, we would like to estimate {@{the frequency of the received signal}@}. To do so, we may correlate {@{the received signal with several matched filters of [sinusoids](sinusoidal%20model.md) at varying frequencies}@}. {@{The matched filter with the highest output}@} will reveal, {@{with high probability, the frequency of the reflected signal}@} and help us determine {@{the [radial velocity](radial%20velocity.md) of the object}@}, i.e. {@{the relative speed either directly towards or away from the observer}@}. This method is, in fact, a simple version of {@{the [discrete Fourier transform \(DFT\)](discrete%20Fourier%20transform.md)}@}. The DFT takes {@{an $N$-valued complex input and correlates it with $N$ matched filters}@}, corresponding to {@{complex exponentials at $N$ different frequencies}@}, to yield {@{$N$ complex-valued numbers corresponding to the relative amplitudes and phases of the sinusoidal components}@} \(see {@{[Moving target indication](moving%20target%20indication.md)}@}\). <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309-->

### digital communications

The matched filter is also used in {@{communications}@}. In the context of {@{a communication system that sends [binary](binary%20number.md) messages}@} from {@{the transmitter to the receiver across a noisy channel}@}, a matched filter can be used to detect {@{the transmitted pulses in the noisy received signal}@}. <p> {@{![A very basic and simple model of a digital communication system showing the use of a matched filter in maximizing signal-to-noise ratio of a received signal.](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Matched%20Filter%20Total%20System.jpg)}@} <p> Imagine we want to send {@{the sequence "0101100100" coded in non polar [non-return-to-zero](non-return-to-zero.md) \(NRZ\)}@} through a certain channel. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309-->

Mathematically, {@{a sequence in NRZ code}@} can be described as {@{a sequence of unit pulses or shifted [rect functions](rectangular%20function.md)}@}, each pulse being {@{weighted by +1 if the bit is "1" and by -1 if the bit is "0"}@}. Formally, {@{the scaling factor for the $k^{\mathrm {th} }$ bit}@} is, {@{$$\ a_{k}={\begin{cases}+1,&{\text{if bit } }k{\text{ is } }1,\\-1,&{\text{if bit } }k{\text{ is } }0.\end{cases} }$$}@} We can represent {@{our message, $M(t)$, as the sum of shifted unit pulses}@}: {@{$$\ M(t)=\sum _{k=-\infty }^{\infty }a_{k}\times \Pi \left({\frac {t-kT}{T} }\right).$$}@} where {@{$T$ is the time length of one bit and $\Pi (x)$ is the [rectangular function](rectangular%20function.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309-->

Thus, {@{the signal to be sent by the transmitter}@} is <p> {@{![Binary message coded in NRZ.](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Original%20message.svg)}@} <p> If we model {@{our noisy channel as an [AWGN](AWGN.md) channel}@}, {@{white Gaussian noise is added}@} to the signal. At {@{the receiver end, for a Signal-to-noise ratio of 3 dB}@}, this may look like: <p> {@{![Received message.](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Received%20message.svg)}@} <p> A first glance will not {@{reveal the original transmitted sequence}@}. There is {@{a high power of noise relative to the power of the desired signal}@} \(i.e., there is {@{a low [signal-to-noise ratio](signal-to-noise%20ratio.md)}@}\). If the receiver were to {@{sample this signal at the correct moments}@}, {@{the resulting binary message could be incorrect}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309-->

To increase {@{our signal-to-noise ratio}@}, we pass {@{the received signal through a matched filter}@}. In this case, the filter should be {@{matched to an NRZ pulse \(equivalent to a "1" coded in NRZ code\)}@}. Precisely, {@{the impulse response of the ideal matched filter, assuming white \(uncorrelated\) noise}@} should be {@{a time-reversed [complex-conjugated](complex%20conjugate.md) scaled version of the signal}@} that we are seeking. We choose {@{$$\ h(t)=\Pi \left({\frac {t}{T} }\right).$$}@} In this case, due to {@{symmetry, the time-reversed complex conjugate of $h(t)$ is in fact $h(t)$}@}, allowing us to call {@{$h(t)$ the impulse response of our matched filter convolution system}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309-->

After convolving {@{with the correct matched filter}@}, {@{the resulting signal, $M_{\mathrm {filtered} }(t)$}@} is, {@{$$\ M_{\mathrm {filtered} }(t)=(M*h)(t)$$}@} where {@{$*$ denotes convolution}@}. <p> {@{![The received message image:Received_message.jpg is now filtered using a matched filter.](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Filtered%20message.svg)}@} <p> Which can now be {@{safely sampled by the receiver at the correct sampling instants}@}, and compared to {@{an appropriate threshold}@}, resulting in {@{a correct interpretation of the binary message}@}. <p> {@{![A threshold can be applied to the filtered signal image:Filtered_message.jpg on the appropriate sampling instants, and thus the encoded binary sequence can be obtained.](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Filtered%20message%20threshold.svg)}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-14,17,309!2026-02-13,16,290!2026-02-13,16,290-->

10. ["LIGO: How We Searched For Merging Black Holes And Found GW150914"](https://ligo.org/science-summaries/GW150914CBC/). A technique known as matched filtering is used to see if there are any signals contained within our data. The aim of matched filtering is to see if the data contains any signals similar to a template bank member. Since our templates should describe the gravitational waveforms for the range of different merging systems that we expect to be able to see, any sufficiently loud signal should be found by this method. <a id="^ref-10"></a>^ref-10
