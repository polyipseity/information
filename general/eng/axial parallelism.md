# axial parallelism

__Axial parallelism__ (also called {@{__gyroscopic stiffness__, __inertia__ or __rigidity__, or "__rigidity in space__"}@}) is {@{the characteristic of a rotating body in which the direction of the [axis of rotation](rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md) remains fixed as the object moves through [space](space.md)}@}. In the long term, however, {@{the axis of rotation do change slowly due to [axial precession](axial%20precession.md), though the [axial tilt](axial%20tilt.md) remains unchanged (if only axial precession is considered)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-11,265,330!2025-08-28,304,290!2025-02-19,173,310-->
