# axial tilt

In [astronomy](astronomy.md), __axial tilt__, also known as {@{__obliquity__}@}, is {@{the [angle](angle.md) between an object's [rotational axis](rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md) and its [orbital](orbit.md) axis, which is the line perpendicular to its [orbital plane](orbital%20plane.md)}@}; equivalently, {@{it is the angle between its [equatorial plane](equator.md) and orbital plane}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-14,455,310!2025-10-24,341,290!2025-12-23,396,310-->

## Earth

## seasons

- see: [season](season.md)

Earth's [axis](rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md) {@{remains tilted in approximately the same direction relative to the [background stars](fixed%20stars.md) throughout a year \(regardless of where it is in its [orbit](orbit.md)\)}@} due to {@{the [gyroscope effect](axial%20parallelism.md)}@}. This means that {@{one [pole](celestial%20pole.md) (and the associated hemisphere of Earth) is directed away from the [Sun](Sun.md) at one side of the orbit, and half an orbit later (half a year later) this pole is directed towards the [Sun](Sun.md)}@}. This causes {@{Earth's [seasons](season.md). [Summer](summer.md) occurs in the [Northern hemisphere](Northern%20Hemisphere.md) when the north pole is directed toward the Sun, and [winter](wintr.md) when directed away}@}. For the [Southern Hemisphere](Southern%20Hemisphere.md), {@{the timing is reversed (the seasons are opposite)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-07-19,1071,339!2027-04-28,778,336!2027-02-06,703,319!2027-05-03,782,336-->
