# shear wall

## description

Shear walls are {@{vertically continuous structures}@}, which are {@{much stiffer than rigid frame and provides most lateral and some gravity resistance}@}. Along the plane of shear walls, one may find {@{multiple shear walls}@}, and the shear walls are connected by {@{beams or slabs}@}. In a building, there may be {@{multiple planes of shear walls}@}, which are usually {@{parallel to each other}@}. It resists loads {@{parallel to the plane of the shear wall}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,282,330!2025-03-09,209,310!2026-03-16,488,310!2025-01-27,190,310!2027-04-09,807,330!2025-04-05,247,330!2026-08-23,630,330-->

Economically, it makes sense {@{until up to about 35 stories}@}. Examples include {@{high-rise residential buildings}@}. <!--SR:!2026-11-26,704,330!2026-05-25,504,310-->

It can be combined with {@{[rigid frame](rigid%20frame.md), constrained to deflect together}@}, to get a {@{shear-walled structure}@}. This provides {@{stiffer structure than rigid frame or shear walls alone}@}. It is economic up to {@{about 50 stories}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-17,193,310!2026-11-11,693,330!2025-02-28,193,290!2026-05-14,496,310-->

In detail, the shear walls in a shear-walled structure often {@{form box-shaped (C-shaped) cores around elevators and stairs around the center of the building}@}. Such box-shaped core walls as a spatial system can {@{transmit lateral loads in both directions, and can resist all types of loads}@}. In practice, the shape of the cores are {@{governed by elevator and stair requirements}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-31,181,310!2025-05-23,250,290!2025-07-21,292,290-->
