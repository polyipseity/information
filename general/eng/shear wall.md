# shear wall

## description

Shear walls are {@{vertically continuous structures}@}, which are {@{much stiffer than rigid frame and provides most lateral and some gravity resistance}@}. Along the plane of shear walls, one may find {@{multiple shear walls}@}, and the shear walls are connected by {@{beams or slabs}@}. In a building, there may be {@{multiple planes of shear walls}@}, which are usually {@{parallel to each other}@}. It resists loads {@{parallel to the plane of the shear wall}@}.

Economically, it makes sense {@{until up to about 35 stories}@}. Examples include {@{high-rise residential buildings}@}.

It can be combined with {@{[rigid frame](rigid%20frame.md), constrained to deflect together}@}, to get a {@{shear-walled structure}@}. This provides {@{stiffer structure than rigid frame or shear walls alone}@}. It is economic up to {@{about 50 stories}@}.

In detail, the shear walls in a shear-walled structure often {@{form box-shaped (C-shaped) cores around elevators and stairs around the center of the building}@}. Such box-shaped core walls as a spatial system can {@{transmit lateral loads in both directions, and can resist all types of loads}@}. In practice, the shape of the cores are {@{governed by elevator and stair requirements}@}.
