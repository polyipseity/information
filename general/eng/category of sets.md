# category of sets

In {@{the [mathematical](mathematics.md) field of [category theory](category%20theory.md)}@}, {@{the __category of sets__, denoted by __Set__}@}, is {@{the [category](category%20(mathematics).md) whose [objects](category%20theory.md) are [sets](set%20(mathematics).md)}@}. {@{The arrows or [morphisms](morphism.md) between sets _A_ and _B_}@} are {@{the [functions](function%20(mathematics).md) from _A_ to _B_}@}, and {@{the composition of morphisms is the [composition of functions](function%20composition.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-03,279,330!2025-12-22,270,330!2025-09-21,192,310!2026-01-01,278,330!2025-12-26,273,330!2026-01-16,290,330-->

{@{Many other categories \(such as the [category of groups](category%20of%20groups.md), with [group homomorphisms](group%20homomorphisms.md) as arrows\)}@} {@{add structure to the objects of the category of sets or restrict the arrows to functions of a particular kind \(or both\)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-03,190,310!2025-10-23,205,310-->

## properties of the category of sets

{@{The axioms of a category are satisfied by __Set__}@} because {@{composition of functions is [associative](associative%20property.md)}@}, and because {@{every set _X_ has an [identity function](identity%20function.md) id<sub>_X_</sub> : _X_ → _X_ which serves as identity element for function composition}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-19,267,330!2025-12-27,274,330!2026-01-18,292,330-->

{@{The [epimorphisms](epimorphism.md) in __Set__ are the [surjective](surjective.md) maps}@}, {@{the [monomorphisms](monomorphism.md) are the [injective](injective.md) maps}@}, and {@{the [isomorphisms](isomorphism%20(category%20theory).md#category%20theoretic%20view) are the [bijective](bijective.md) maps}@}. (annotation: for {@{other categories, these are not true in general}@}) <!--SR:!2025-10-06,193,310!2026-01-25,246,270!2026-01-02,279,330!2026-03-31,353,350-->

{@{The [empty set](empty%20set.md) serves as the [initial object](initial%20object.md) (annotation: an initial object has exactly one morphism to every object) in __Set__}@} with {@{[empty functions](empty%20function.md#standard%20functions) as morphisms}@}. {@{Every [singleton](singleton%20(mathematics).md) is a [terminal object](terminal%20object.md) (annotation: a terminal object has exactly one morphism from every object)}@}, with {@{the functions mapping all elements of the source sets to the single target element as morphisms}@}. There are thus {@{no [zero objects](zero%20object.md) (annotation: an object that is both initial and terminal) in __Set__}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-16,189,310!2026-01-20,294,330!2026-01-07,283,330!2026-01-15,290,330!2025-12-25,272,330-->

The category __Set__ is {@{[complete and co-complete](complete%20category.md) (annotation: all small limits and colimits exist)}@}. {@{The [product](product%20(category%20theory).md) (annotation: "least specific" object which admits a morphism to each of the given objects) in this category}@} is given by {@{the [cartesian product](Cartesian%20product.md) of sets}@}. {@{The [coproduct](coproduct%20(category%20theory).md) (annotation: "least specific" object to which each object in the family admits a morphism)}@} is given by {@{the [disjoint union](disjoint%20union.md)}@}: given {@{sets _A_<sub>_i_</sub> where _i_ ranges over some index set _I_}@}, we construct {@{the coproduct as the union of _A_<sub>_i_</sub>×{_i_} \(the cartesian product with _i_ serves to ensure that all the components stay disjoint\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-18,292,330!2027-09-12,746,330!2026-01-15,290,330!2025-12-24,271,330!2026-01-14,288,330!2027-07-03,693,330!2025-12-28,275,330-->

__Set__ is {@{the prototype of a [concrete category](concrete%20category.md)}@}; other categories are {@{concrete if they are "built on" __Set__ in some well-defined way}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-18,266,330!2025-12-26,273,330-->

{@{Every two-element set}@} serves as {@{a [subobject classifier](subobject%20classifier.md) (annotation: subobject is a generalization of a subset; subobject classifier is too complicated to explain here) in __Set__}@}. {@{The power object of a set _A_}@} is given by {@{its [power set](power%20set.md)}@}, and {@{the [exponential object](exponential%20object.md) (annotation: generalization of a function space) of the sets _A_ and _B_}@} is given by {@{the set of all functions from _A_ to _B_}@}. __Set__ is thus {@{a [topos](topos.md)}@} \(and in particular {@{[cartesian closed](Cartesian%20closed%20category.md) (annotation: roughly speaking, any morphism defined on a product of two objects can be naturally identified with a morphism defined on one of the factors)}@} and {@{[exact in the sense of Barr](regular%20category.md#exact%20(effective)%20categories)}@}\). <!--SR:!2026-01-04,280,330!2025-09-23,194,310!2026-01-02,279,330!2026-01-09,285,330!2026-01-19,293,330!2026-01-03,280,330!2026-01-15,290,330!2026-01-28,248,270!2025-12-14,261,348-->

__Set__ is not {@{[abelian](abelian%20category.md), [additive](additive%20category.md) nor [preadditive](preadditive%20category.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-11-18,798,330-->

{@{Every non-empty set}@} is {@{an [injective object](injective%20object.md) (annotation: every morphism to an injective object factors through every monomorphism) in __Set__}@}. {@{Every set}@} is {@{a [projective object](projective%20module.md) in __Set__ \(assuming the [axiom of choice](axiom%20of%20choice.md)\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-09,285,330!2026-04-15,331,290!2026-01-15,290,330!2027-05-17,623,290-->

{@{The [finitely presentable objects](accessible%20category.md) (annotation:  "size" (a cardinal number) of the operations needed to generate said objects is finite)}@} in __Set__ are {@{the finite sets}@}. Since {@{every set is a [direct limit](direct%20limit.md) of its finite subsets}@}, the category __Set__ is {@{a [locally finitely presentable category](accessible%20category.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-24,272,330!2025-12-17,265,330!2025-10-04,191,310!2026-01-13,287,330-->

If {@{_C_ is an arbitrary category}@}, {@{the [contravariant functors](contravariant%20functor.md#covariance%20and%20contravariance) from _C_ to __Set__}@} are often an important object of study. If {@{_A_ is an object of _C_}@}, then {@{the functor from _C_ to __Set__ that sends _X_ to Hom<sub>_C_</sub>\(_X_,_A_\) \(the set of morphisms in _C_ from _X_ to _A_\)}@} (annotation: a morphism in _C_, {@{$f: X \to Y$, is sent to $- \circ f$ (composition with $f$ on the right), which accepts a $(Y \to A) \in \mathrm{Hom}_C(Y, A)$ and outputs a $(X \to A) \in \mathrm{Hom}_C(X, A)$; we can see the direction is reversed}@}) is an example of such a functor. (annotation: see [Yoneda lemma](Yoneda%20lemma.md)) If {@{_C_ is a [small category](category%20(mathematics).md#small%20and%20large%20categories) \(i.e. the collection of its objects forms a set\)}@}, then {@{the contravariant functors from _C_ to __Set__, together with natural transformations as morphisms}@}, form {@{a new category, a [functor category](functor%20category.md)}@} known as {@{the category of [presheaves](presheaves.md#presheaves) on _C_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-22,269,330!2026-01-01,278,330!2025-12-21,269,330!2026-01-03,280,330!2025-12-22,269,330!2026-01-06,282,330!2027-03-21,563,310!2025-12-31,277,330!2025-10-05,192,310-->

## foundations for the category of sets

In {@{[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory](Zermelo–Fraenkel%20set%20theory.md)}@} {@{the collection of all sets is not a set}@}; this follows from {@{the [axiom of foundation](axiom%20of%20foundation.md)}@}. One refers to {@{collections that are not sets as [proper classes](proper%20class.md)}@}. One cannot {@{handle proper classes as one handles sets}@}; in particular, one cannot {@{write that those proper classes belong to a collection \(either a set or a proper class\)}@}. This is a problem because {@{it means that the category of sets cannot be formalized straightforwardly in this setting}@}. {@{Categories like __Set__ whose collection of objects forms a proper class}@} are known as {@{[large categories](large%20category.md#small%20and%20large%20categories)}@}, to {@{distinguish them from the small categories whose objects form a set}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-31,277,330!2026-01-08,284,330!2026-01-02,279,330!2026-01-15,290,330!2026-01-04,281,330!2025-12-31,277,330!2025-12-28,275,330!2026-01-19,293,330!2027-09-03,740,330!2026-01-15,290,330-->

{@{One way to resolve the problem}@} is to {@{work in a system that gives formal status to proper classes, such as [NBG set theory](NBG%20set%20theory.md)}@}. In this setting, {@{categories formed from sets are said to be _small_}@} and {@{those \(like __Set__\) that are formed from proper classes are said to be _large_}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-15,290,330!2026-01-04,281,330!2026-01-12,286,330!2025-12-23,270,330-->

{@{Another solution}@} is to {@{assume the existence of [Grothendieck universes](Grothendieck%20universe.md)}@}. Roughly speaking, a Grothendieck universe is {@{a set which is itself a model of ZF\(C\)}@} \(for instance {@{if a set belongs to a universe, its elements and its powerset will belong to the universe}@}\). {@{The existence of Grothendieck universes}@} \(other than {@{the empty set and the set $V_{\omega }$ of all [hereditarily finite sets](hereditarily%20finite%20set.md)}@}\) is {@{not implied by the usual ZF axioms}@}; it is {@{an additional, independent axiom, roughly equivalent to the existence of [strongly inaccessible cardinals](strongly%20inaccessible%20cardinal.md)}@}. Assuming this extra axiom, one can {@{limit the objects of __Set__ to the elements of a particular universe}@}. \(There is {@{no "set of all sets" within the model}@}, but one can {@{still reason about the class _U_ of all inner sets, i.e., elements of _U_}@}.\) <!--SR:!2026-01-08,284,330!2026-01-17,291,330!2025-12-23,271,330!2026-01-15,290,330!2026-01-07,283,330!2026-01-15,290,330!2025-12-29,276,330!2027-01-26,550,310!2026-01-15,290,330!2026-01-06,282,330!2025-12-29,276,330-->

In {@{one variation of this scheme}@}, the class of sets is {@{the union of the entire tower of Grothendieck universes}@}. \(This is {@{necessarily a [proper class](proper%20class.md)}@}, but {@{each Grothendieck universe is a set because it is an element of some larger Grothendieck universe}@}.\) However, one {@{does not work directly with the "category of all sets"}@}. Instead, theorems are {@{expressed in terms of the category __Set__<sub>_U_</sub>}@} whose {@{objects are the elements of a sufficiently large Grothendieck universe _U_}@}, and are then {@{shown not to depend on the particular choice of _U_}@}. As {@{a foundation for [category theory](category%20theory.md)}@}, this approach is {@{well matched to a system like [Tarski–Grothendieck set theory](Tarski–Grothendieck%20set%20theory.md)}@} in which {@{one cannot reason directly about proper classes}@}; {@{its principal disadvantage}@} is that {@{a theorem can be true of all __Set__<sub>_U_</sub> but not of __Set__}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-20,268,330!2026-01-08,284,330!2026-01-15,290,330!2025-12-27,274,330!2026-01-15,290,330!2026-01-15,290,330!2026-01-07,283,330!2026-01-01,278,330!2025-12-23,270,330!2026-01-17,291,330!2026-01-09,285,330!2025-09-19,191,310!2027-04-21,586,310-->

Various other solutions, and variations on the above, have been proposed.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup>

{@{The same issues arise with other concrete categories}@}, such as {@{the [category of groups](category%20of%20groups.md) or the [category of topological spaces](category%20of%20topological%20spaces.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-15,289,330!2026-01-03,280,330-->
