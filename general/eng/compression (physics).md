# compression

## effects

For {@{uniaxial compression}@}, ordinary material are likely to undergo {@{elastic deformation}@}; that is, {@{shortening in length and bulging in the middle, and returning to its original length and shape once the compression is removed}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-26,218,330!2025-04-06,248,330!2025-04-07,205,270-->
