# celestial pole

The north and south __celestial poles__ are {@{the two points in the [sky](sky.md) where [Earth](Earth.md)'s [axis of rotation](rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md), indefinitely extended, intersects the [celestial sphere](celestial%20sphere.md)}@}.

## finding the north celestial pole

The [north](north.md) celestial pole currently is {@{within one degree of the bright star [Polaris](Polaris.md) (named from the [Latin](Latin.md) _stella polaris_, meaning "pole star")}@}.

To {@{find [Polaris](Polaris.md)}@}, from {@{a point in the [Northern Hemisphere](Northern%20Hemisphere.md), face [north](north.md)}@} and {@{locate the [Big Dipper](Big%20Dipper.md) (Plough) and [Little Dipper](Ursa%20Minor.md) [asterisms](asterism%20(astronomy).md)}@}. Looking at {@{the "cup" part of the Big Dipper, imagine that the two stars at the outside edge of the cup form a line pointing upward out of the cup}@}. This line points directly at {@{the [star](star.md) at the tip of the Little Dipper's handle, which is Polaris}@}.

## finding the south celestial pole

{@{[Sigma Octantis](Sigma%20Octantis.md)}@} is identified as the [south](south.md) pole star, {@{more than one degree away}@} from the pole, but {@{with an [apparent magnitude](apparent%20magnitude.md) of 5.5 it is barely visible on a clear night}@}.

### method one: the Southern Cross

{@{The [south](south.md) celestial pole}@} can be located from {@{the [Southern Cross](Crux.md) (Crux)}@}. Draw {@{an imaginary line from [γ Crucis](Gacrux.md) to [α Crucis](Acrux.md)—the two stars at the extreme ends of the long axis of the cross}@}—and {@{follow this line through the sky}@}. Go {@{four-and-a-half times the distance of the long axis}@} in {@{the direction the narrow end of the cross points (the foot of the crucifix)}@}. This point is {@{5 or 6 degrees from the south celestial pole}@}.
