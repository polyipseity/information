# tidal acceleration

__Tidal acceleration__ is {@{an effect of the [tidal forces](tidal%20force.md) between an [orbiting](orbit.md) [natural satellite](natural%20satellite.md) (e.g. the [Moon](Moon.md)) and the [primary](primary%20body.md) [planet](planet.md) that it orbits (e.g. [Earth](Earth.md))}@}. The acceleration causes {@{a gradual recession of a satellite in a [prograde](retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) orbit (satellite moving to a higher orbit, away from the primary body), and a corresponding slowdown of the primary's [rotation](rotation.md)}@}. This process eventually leads to {@{[_tidal locking_](tidal%20locking.md), usually the smaller body first, and later the larger body}@}. {@{The [Earth–Moon system](orbit%20of%20the%20Moon.md)}@} is the best-studied case. <!--SR:!2028-01-06,904,330!2026-11-19,597,290!2026-09-19,549,310!2027-04-10,741,330-->

{@{The similar process of __tidal deceleration__}@} occurs for satellites that {@{have an orbital period that is shorter than the primary's rotational period, or that [orbit](orbit.md) in a [retrograde](retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) direction}@}. <!--SR:!2027-09-18,871,330!2026-11-27,649,330-->

The naming is somewhat confusing, because {@{the average speed of the satellite relative to the body it orbits is _decreased_ as a result of tidal acceleration, and _increased_ as a result of tidal deceleration}@}. This conundrum occurs because {@{a positive acceleration at one instant causes the satellite to loop farther outward during the next half orbit, decreasing its average speed over the entire orbit}@}. A continuing positive acceleration causes {@{the satellite to spiral outward with a decreasing speed and angular rate, resulting in a negative acceleration of angle}@}. A continuing negative acceleration has the opposite effect. However, the angular momentum of the satellite {@{still increases (decreases for tidal deceleration)}@}, as the orbital speed is {@{inversely proportional to the square of the orbital radius ($v \propto \frac 1 {\sqrt r}$)}@}, so {@{the increase in radius increases the angular momentum faster than the decrease in orbital speed decreasing the angular momentum}@}. <!--SR:!2027-09-01,862,330!2029-02-22,1101,290!2028-03-12,939,290!2027-08-11,849,330!2026-07-31,541,310!2026-12-16,656,330-->
