# mass–energy equivalence

In [physics](physics.md), __mass–energy equivalence__ is {@{the relationship between [mass](mass.md) and [energy](energy.md) in a system's [rest frame](rest%20frame.md), where the two quantities differ only by a multiplicative constant and the units of measurement}@}. This principle is described by {@{[Albert Einstein](Albert%20Einstein.md)'s famous formula: $$E = mc^2$$}@}.
