# radio galaxy

A __radio galaxy__ is {@{a [galaxy](galaxy.md) with giant regions of radio emission extending well beyond its visible structure}@}. These energetic radio lobes are {@{powered by jets from its [active galactic nucleus](active%20galactic%20nucleus.md)}@}. They have luminosities {@{up to 10<sup>39</sup> [W](watt.md) at [radio wavelengths](radio%20wave.md) between 10 MHz and 100 GHz}@}. The radio emission is due to {@{the [synchrotron process](synchrotron%20radiation.md)}@}. The observed structure in radio emission is {@{determined by the interaction between twin [jets](astrophysical%20jet.md#relativistic%20jet) and the external medium, modified by the effects of [relativistic beaming](relativistic%20beaming.md)}@}. The [host galaxies](active%20galactic%20nucleus.md) are {@{almost exclusively large [elliptical galaxies](elliptical%20galaxy.md)}@}. {@{_Radio-loud_ active galaxies}@} can be {@{detected at large distances, making them valuable tools for [observational cosmology](observational%20cosmology.md)}@}. Recently, much work has been done on {@{the effects of these objects on the [intergalactic medium](warmâ€“hot%20intergalactic%20medium.md), particularly in [galaxy groups and clusters](galaxy%20groups%20and%20clusters.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-12,197,310!2025-07-21,257,330!2025-02-12,79,230!2025-02-01,123,290!2025-04-13,179,310!2025-07-25,215,270!2025-01-19,111,290!2025-08-29,288,330!2025-01-20,102,270-->
