# entropy

## definitions and descriptions

There are two main ways to describe entropy: {@{the macroscopic description from [classical thermodynamics](thermodynamics.md#classical%20thermodynamics) and the microscopic description from [statistical mechanics](statistical%20mechanics.md). The former one defines entropy based on macroscopic measurable variables like [pressure](pressure.md), [temperature](temperature.md), total [mass](mass.md), and [volume](volume.md), while the latter defines entropy based on statistics of motions of microscopic constituents in a [system](thermodynamic%20system.md)}@}. Both definitions are {@{consistent with each other. Proofs are known for some [statistical ensembles](ensemble%20(mathematical%20physics).md)}@}.

> - physical analogy ::@:: There is no easy physical analogy for entropy. The best analogy one can make is that entropy is a [state variable](state%20variable.md) of a [thermodynamic equilibrium](thermodynamic%20equilibrium.md), similar to [internal energy](internal%20energy.md), [pressure](pressure.md), [temperature](temperature.md), [volume](volume.md), etc.
