# star cluster

__Star clusters__ are {@{large groups of [stars](star.md) held together by [self-gravitation](self-gravitation.md)}@}. {@{Two main types}@} of {@{star clusters can be distinguished}@}. {@{[Globular clusters](#globular%20cluster)}@} are {@{tight groups of ten thousand to millions of old stars which are [gravitationally](gravity.md) bound}@}. {@{[Open clusters](#open%20cluster)}@} are {@{more loosely clustered groups of stars, generally containing fewer than a few hundred members, that are often very young}@}. <!--SR:!2028-07-12,1124,350!2028-12-11,1244,350!2027-10-20,888,330!2026-08-09,521,310!2027-11-09,933,350!2027-07-19,822,330!2025-09-06,19,340-->

## astronomical significance

Clusters are also {@{a crucial step in determining the [distance scale of the universe](cosmic%20distance%20ladder.md)}@}. {@{A few of the nearest clusters}@} are {@{close enough for their distances to be measured using [parallax](stellar%20parallax.md)}@}. {@{A [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md) can be plotted}@} for {@{these clusters which has [absolute values](absolute%20magnitude.md) known on the [luminosity](luminosity.md) axis}@}. Then, when {@{similar diagram is plotted for a cluster whose distance is not known}@}, {@{the position of the main sequence}@} can be {@{compared to that of the first cluster and the distance estimated}@}. This process is known as {@{_main-sequence fitting_}@}. {@{[Reddening](extinction%20(astronomy).md) and [stellar populations](stellar%20population.md)}@} must be {@{accounted for when using this method}@}. <!--SR:!2027-07-13,823,330!2028-01-24,992,350!2026-02-19,429,310!2027-09-09,870,330!2027-05-22,651,270!2029-06-04,1385,350!2028-08-07,1147,350!2025-09-06,19,340!2025-09-06,19,340!2025-09-06,19,340!2025-09-06,19,340-->
