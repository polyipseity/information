# star cluster

__Star clusters__ are {@{large groups of [stars](star.md) held together by [self-gravitation](self-gravitation.md)}@}. {@{Two main types}@} of star clusters can be distinguished. {@{[Globular clusters](#globular%20cluster)}@} are {@{tight groups of ten thousand to millions of old stars which are [gravitationally](gravity.md) bound}@}. {@{[Open clusters](#open%20cluster)}@} are {@{more loosely clustered groups of stars, generally containing fewer than a few hundred members, that are often very young}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-14,247,330!2025-07-16,274,330!2025-05-15,207,310!2026-08-09,521,310!2025-04-20,205,330!2025-04-18,190,310-->

## astronomical significance

Clusters are also {@{a crucial step in determining the [distance scale of the universe](cosmic%20distance%20ladder.md)}@}. A few of the nearest clusters are {@{close enough for their distances to be measured using [parallax](stellar%20parallax.md)}@}. {@{A [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md) can be plotted}@} for {@{these clusters which has [absolute values](absolute%20magnitude.md) known on the [luminosity](luminosity.md) axis}@}. Then, when similar diagram is plotted for {@{a cluster whose distance is not known, the position of the main sequence can be compared to that of the first cluster and the distance estimated}@}. This process is known as {@{_main-sequence fitting_}@}. {@{[Reddening](extinction%20(astronomy).md) and [stellar populations](stellar%20population.md)}@} must be accounted for when using this method. <!--SR:!2027-07-13,823,330!2025-05-06,218,330!2026-02-19,429,310!2025-04-22,203,310!2025-08-08,241,270!2025-08-19,304,330!2025-06-17,252,330-->
