# Yoneda lemma

{@{The __Yoneda lemma__}@} is {@{a fundamental result in [category theory](category%20theory.md), a branch of mathematics}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> It is an abstract result on {@{[functors](functor.md) of the type _morphisms into a fixed object_}@}. It is a vast generalisation of {@{[Cayley's theorem](Cayley's%20theorem.md) from [group theory](group%20theory.md)}@} \(viewing a group as {@{a miniature category with just one object and only isomorphisms}@}\). It also generalizes {@{the information-preserving relation}@} between {@{a term and its [continuation-passing style transformation](continuation-passing%20style.md) from [programming language theory](programming%20language%20theory.md)}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> It allows {@{the [embedding](subcategory.md#embeddings) of any [locally small category](locally%20small%20category.md#small%20and%20large%20categories)}@} into {@{a [category of functors](category%20of%20functors.md) \([contravariant](functor.md#covariance%20and%20contravariance) set-valued functors\) defined on that category}@}. It also clarifies how {@{the embedded category of [representable functors](representable%20functor.md) and their [natural transformations](natural%20transformation.md)}@} relates to {@{the other objects in the larger functor category}@}. It is {@{an important tool}@} that underlies {@{several modern developments in [algebraic geometry](algebraic%20geometry.md) and [representation theory](representation%20theory.md)}@}. It is named after {@{[Nobuo Yoneda](Nobuo%20Yoneda.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-30,352,349!2029-10-01,1342,350!2026-03-31,352,349!2029-10-04,1345,350!2028-04-06,892,330!2028-09-22,1048,349!2028-09-02,1032,349!2029-10-02,1343,350!2026-03-02,328,349!2028-08-08,1013,349!2026-07-24,419,310!2026-03-29,350,349!2026-02-24,5,358!2026-02-24,5,358-->

## generalities

The Yoneda lemma suggests that {@{instead of studying the [locally small](locally%20small.md#small%20and%20large%20categories) category ${\mathcal {C} }$}@}, one should {@{study the category of all functors of ${\mathcal {C} }$ into $\mathbf {Set}$ \(the [category of sets](category%20of%20sets.md) with [functions](function%20(mathematics).md) as [morphisms](morphism.md)\)}@}. $\mathbf {Set}$ is {@{a category we think we understand well}@}, and a functor of ${\mathcal {C} }$ into $\mathbf {Set}$ can be {@{seen as a "representation" of ${\mathcal {C} }$ in terms of known structures}@}. {@{The original category ${\mathcal {C} }$ is contained}@} in this functor category, but {@{new objects appear in the functor category}@}, which {@{were absent and "hidden" in ${\mathcal {C} }$}@}. {@{Treating these new objects just like the old ones}@} often {@{unifies and simplifies the theory}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-15,366,359!2026-03-30,351,349!2027-12-24,839,349!2026-03-27,348,349!2029-10-01,1342,350!2026-03-18,341,349!2030-05-22,1548,369!2028-11-26,1087,349!2027-04-25,639,330-->

This approach is akin to \(and in fact generalizes\) the common method of {@{studying a [ring](ring%20(mathematics).md) by investigating the [modules](module%20(mathematics).md) over that ring}@}. The ring takes {@{the place of the category ${\mathcal {C} }$}@}, and the category of modules over the ring is {@{a category of functors defined on ${\mathcal {C} }$}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-27,719,329!2026-03-29,350,349!2026-04-09,361,359-->

## formal statement

Yoneda's lemma concerns {@{functors from a fixed category ${\mathcal {C} }$ to a [category of sets](category%20of%20sets.md), $\mathbf {Set}$}@}. If {@{${\mathcal {C} }$ is a [locally small category](locally%20small%20category.md#small%20and%20large%20categories) \(i.e. the [hom-sets](hom-set.md#hom-set) are actual sets and not [proper classes](proper%20class.md)\)}@}, then {@{each object $A$ of ${\mathcal {C} }$ gives rise to a functor to $\mathbf {Set}$ called a [hom-functor](hom-functor.md)}@}. This functor is denoted: {@{$$h_{A}=\mathrm {Hom} (A,-) \,.$$}@} {@{The \([covariant](covariance%20and%20contravariance%20of%20functors.md#covariance%20and%20contravariance)\) hom-functor $h_{A}$}@} sends {@{$X\in {\mathcal {C} }$ to the set of [morphisms](morphism.md) $\mathrm {Hom} (A,X)$}@} (annotation: Now each object is {@{identified by the set of morphisms from $A$ to said object}@}.) and sends {@{a morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ \(where $Y\in {\mathcal {C} }$\)}@} to {@{the morphism $f\circ -$ \(composition with $f$ on the left\) that sends a morphism $g$ in $\mathrm {Hom} (A,X)$ to the morphism $f\circ g$ in $\mathrm {Hom} (A,Y)$}@}. (annotation: A morphism $f: X \to Y$ is replaced by {@{a morphism that sends a set of morphisms from $A$ to $X$ to a set of morphisms from $A$ to $Y$ by composing each morphism in the set with the original morphism $f$ on the left}@}.)

A natural transformation {@{assigns said elements in the former category to elements in the latter category}@}. Now consider {@{the identity morphism of $A$, $\mathrm{id}_A$}@}. A natural transformation can {@{assign $\mathrm{id}_A$ in the set of morphisms to any element $u$ in the set $F(A)$}@}. Then {@{every morphism $f: A \to X$ must be assigned to $F(f)(u)$, since $f \circ -$ in $h_A(\mathcal C)$ corresponds to $F(f)$ in $F(\mathcal C)$ and thus $f \circ \mathrm{id}_A = f$ corresponds to $F(f)(u)$}@}. We note that $F(f)(u)$ is {@{uniquely determined by the choice of $u$, noting the functor $F$, thus $F(f)$, is fixed}@}. This means {@{the elements in $F(\mathcal C)$ that the remaining morphisms $f: A \to X$ are assigned to by the natural transformation are uniquely determined by the choice of $u$}@}. Thus a natural transformation can be {@{identified by $\Phi_A(\mathrm{id}_A)$, i.e. $u = \Phi_A(\mathrm{id}_A)$}@}, and any element $u$ in $F(A)$ can be {@{identified with a natural transformation that sends every morphism $f: A \to X$ to $F(f)(u)$, i.e. $\Phi_X(f) = F(f)(u)$}@}. So a natural transformation in this case is {@{also a isomorphism, thus a natural isomorphism}@}.) <!--SR:!2027-07-17,632,310!2028-09-28,1053,349!2028-09-03,1033,349!2028-01-11,838,330!2029-10-01,1342,350!2026-03-13,338,349!2026-07-25,374,290!2026-03-27,348,349!2026-03-07,331,349!2030-04-14,1516,369!2028-01-20,846,330!2026-03-17,340,349-->

The Yoneda lemma {@{remains true for preadditive categories}@} if we {@{choose as our extension}@} {@{the category of _[additive](additive%20functor.md#additive%20functors)_ contravariant functors}@} from {@{the original category into the category of abelian groups}@} \(annotation: denoted {@{$\mathrm{Add}(C^{\mathrm{op} }, \mathbf{Ab})$}@}\); these are functors which are {@{compatible with the addition of morphisms}@} and should be thought of as {@{forming a _[module category](module%20category.md)_ over the original category}@}. The Yoneda lemma then yields {@{the natural procedure to enlarge a preadditive category so that the enlarged version remains preadditive}@} — in fact, the enlarged version is {@{an [abelian category](abelian%20category.md), a much more powerful condition}@}.

## relationship to Cayley's theorem

As stated above, {@{the Yoneda lemma}@} may be considered as {@{a vast generalization of [Cayley's theorem](Cayley's%20theorem.md) from [group theory](group%20theory.md)}@}. To see this, let {@{${\mathcal {C} }$ be a category with a single object $*$ such that every morphism is an [isomorphism](isomorphism.md) \(i.e. a [groupoid](groupoid.md) with one object\)}@}. Then {@{$G=\mathrm {Hom} _{\mathcal {C} }(*,*)$ forms a [group](group%20(mathematics).md) under the operation of composition}@}, and {@{any group can be realized as a category in this way}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-03,1147,310!2026-03-03,329,349!2026-05-09,385,359!2029-10-04,1345,350!2026-02-24,5,358-->

In this context, {@{a covariant functor ${\mathcal {C} }\to \mathbf {Set}$}@} consists of {@{a set $X$ and a [group homomorphism](group%20homomorphism.md) $G\to \mathrm {Perm} (X)$}@}, (annotation: the single object $*$ is {@{sent to $X$}@}) where {@{$\mathrm {Perm} (X)$ is the group of [permutations](permutation.md) of $X$}@}; in other words, {@{$X$ is a [G-set](G-set.md#definition)}@}. {@{A natural transformation between such functors}@} is {@{the same thing as an [equivariant map](equivariant%20map.md) between $G$-sets}@}: {@{a set function $\alpha \colon X\to Y$}@} with the property that {@{$\alpha (g\cdot x)=g\cdot \alpha (x)$ for all $g$ in $G$ and $x$ in $X$}@}. \(On the left side of this equation, the $\cdot$ denotes {@{the action of $G$ on $X$, and on the right side the action on $Y$}@}.\) <!--SR:!2027-04-18,580,310!2027-11-07,737,329!2026-05-11,387,359!2027-05-04,591,310!2028-03-21,880,330!2029-08-18,1310,350!2026-03-20,343,349!2029-10-01,1342,350!2026-05-07,383,359!2029-10-04,1345,350-->

Now {@{the covariant hom-functor $\mathrm {Hom} _{\mathcal {C} }(*,-)$}@} corresponds to {@{the action of $G$ on itself by left-multiplication \(the contravariant version corresponds to right-multiplication\)}@}. (annotation: The object $*$ is sent to {@{the set of morphisms $\hom(*, *)$, which corresponds to the elements of the group $G$}@}. The morphisms $\hom(*, *)$ are sent to, {@{for each morphism $f: * \to *$, the composition $f \circ -$, which corresponds to left-multiplication of the group element represented by $f$}@}.) The Yoneda lemma with {@{$F=\mathrm {Hom} _{\mathcal {C} }(*,-)$}@} states that <p> &emsp; {@{$\mathrm {Nat} (\mathrm {Hom} _{\mathcal {C} }(*,-),\mathrm {Hom} _{\mathcal {C} }(*,-))\cong \mathrm {Hom} _{\mathcal {C} }(*,*)$}@}, <p> that is, {@{the equivariant maps from this $G$-set to itself are in bijection with $G$}@}. But it is easy to see that \(1\) these maps {@{form a group under composition, which is a [subgroup](subgroup.md) of $\mathrm {Perm} (G)$}@}, and \(2\) the function {@{which gives the bijection is a group homomorphism}@}. \(Going in the reverse direction, it associates to {@{every $g$ in $G$ the equivariant map of right-multiplication by $g$}@}.\) \(annotation: For each equivariant map $\alpha: G \to G$, {@{simply associate it as the right multiplication of an element $a$ of $G$, i.e. $- \cdot a$}@}. This is valid since {@{$\alpha(g \cdot x) = g \cdot x \cdot a = g \cdot \alpha(x)$ for all $g, x$ in $G$}@}. Clearly, the above definition of $\alpha$ {@{forms a subgroup of $\mathrm{Perm}(G)$ under function composition}@}.\) Thus {@{$G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathrm {Perm} (G)$}@}, which is {@{the statement of Cayley's theorem}@}. <!--SR:!2028-04-07,894,330!2026-10-24,481,310!2026-03-09,334,349!2026-05-19,332,290!2026-06-07,351,290!2029-10-01,1342,350!2026-10-25,491,310!2027-02-21,530,309!2026-05-28,339,290!2028-09-24,970,330!2026-08-13,386,290!2027-05-30,562,290!2026-09-20,426,309!2026-03-18,342,349!2026-03-19,342,349-->
