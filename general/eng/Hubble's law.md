# Hubble's law

__Hubble's law__, also known as {@{the __Hubble–Lemaître law__}@}, is {@{the observation in [physical cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md) that [galaxies](galaxy.md) are moving away from [Earth](Earth.md) at speeds proportional to their distance}@}. In other words, {@{the farther they are, the faster they are moving away from [Earth](Earth.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-01-25,1300,350!2029-05-29,1397,350!2026-03-20,464,310-->

## interpretation

The discovery of {@{the linear relationship between redshift and distance, coupled with a supposed linear relation between [recessional velocity](recessional%20velocity.md) and redshift}@}, yields {@{a straightforward mathematical expression for Hubble's law as follows}@}: {@{$$v=H_{0}\,D$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-03-15,398,306!2025-09-23,321,346!2028-12-15,1251,366-->

where

- _v_ is {@{the recessional velocity, typically expressed in km/s}@}.
- _H_<sub>0</sub> is {@{Hubble's constant}@} and corresponds to {@{the value of _H_ (often termed the __Hubble parameter__ which is a value that is [time dependent](time-variant%20system.md) and which can be expressed in terms of the [scale factor](scale%20factor%20(cosmology).md)) in the Friedmann equations taken at the time of observation denoted by the subscript 0}@}. This value is {@{the same throughout the universe for a given [comoving time](comoving%20and%20proper%20distances.md#comoving%20coordinates)}@}.
- _D_ is {@{the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the [comoving distance](comoving%20and%20proper%20distances.md), which is constant) from the [galaxy](galaxy.md) to the observer}@}, measured in {@{[mega](mega-.md) [parsecs](parsec.md) (Mpc), in the 3-space defined by given [cosmological time](cosmic%20time.md)}@}. (Recession velocity is {@{just _v_ = _dD/dt_}@}.) <!--SR:!2025-10-10,333,346!2025-09-23,319,346!2026-02-18,381,306!2025-09-09,196,286!2026-11-15,589,326!2025-09-18,295,306!2025-09-14,312,346-->

Hubble's law is considered {@{a fundamental relation between recessional velocity and distance}@}. However, the relation between {@{recessional velocity and redshift depends on the cosmological model adopted and is not established except for small redshifts}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-13,1347,366!2026-05-13,446,306-->

For {@{distances _D_ larger than the radius of the [Hubble sphere](hubble%20volume.md) _r_<sub>HS</sub>}@}, objects {@{recede at a rate faster than the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md)}@} (_see_ [uses of the proper distance](comoving%20and%20proper%20distances.md#uses%20of%20the%20proper%20distance) for a discussion of the significance of this): {@{$$r_{\text{HS} }={\frac {c}{H_{0} } }$$}@}. Since {@{the Hubble "constant" is a constant only in space, not in time}@}, the radius of the Hubble sphere may {@{increase or decrease over various time intervals}@}. The subscript '0' {@{indicates the value of the Hubble constant today}@}. Current evidence suggests that {@{the expansion of the universe is accelerating (_see_ [accelerating universe](accelerating%20expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md))}@}, meaning that for {@{any given galaxy, the recession velocity dD/dt is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances}@}; however, the Hubble parameter is {@{actually thought to be decreasing with time}@}, meaning that if {@{we were to look at some fixed distance _D_ and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance}@}, {@{later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones}@}. <!--SR:!2027-12-11,931,346!2025-09-16,316,346!2029-05-09,1366,366!2025-09-22,318,346!2029-05-06,1366,366!2025-10-03,327,346!2027-04-18,760,346!2026-08-27,558,326!2029-05-10,1367,366!2028-08-19,1125,346!2028-04-29,1053,346-->

## units derived from the Hubble constant

### Hubble time

The Hubble constant _H_<sub>0</sub> has units of {@{inverse time}@}; {@{the __Hubble time__ _t<sub>H</sub>_}@} is {@{simply defined as the inverse of the Hubble constant}@}, i.e. {@{$$t_{H}\equiv {\frac {1}{H_{0} } }={\frac {1}{67.8\mathrm {~(km/s)/Mpc} } } \approx 4.55\times 10^{17}\mathrm {~s} \approx 14.4{\text{ billion years} }$$}@}. This is {@{slightly different from the age of the universe, which is approximately 13.8 billion years}@}. The Hubble time is {@{the age it would have had if the expansion had been linear}@}, and {@{it is different from the real age of the universe because the expansion is not linear}@}; it {@{depends on the energy content of the universe}@} (see [§ derivation of the Hubble parameter](#derivation%20of%20the%20Hubble%20parameter)). <!--SR:!2025-09-08,284,349!2026-01-31,420,369!2027-12-10,952,369!2026-11-02,526,289!2026-03-10,421,329!2025-12-11,379,369!2025-12-24,389,369!2025-08-14,277,349-->

We currently {@{appear to be approaching a period where the expansion of the universe is exponential}@} due to {@{the increasing dominance of [vacuum energy](vacuum%20energy.md)}@}. In this regime, {@{the Hubble parameter is constant}@}, and {@{the universe grows by a factor [_e_](e%20(mathematical%20constant).md) each Hubble time}@}: {@{$$H\equiv {\frac {\dot {a} }{a} }={\textrm {constant} }\quad \Longrightarrow \quad a\propto e^{Ht}=e^{\frac {t}{t_{H} } }$$}@}. Likewise, the generally accepted value of {@{2.27 [Es](metric%20prefix.md#List%20of%20SI%20prefixes)<sup>−1</sup>}@} means that {@{(at the current rate) the universe would grow by a factor of _e_<sup>2.27</sup> in one [exasecond](orders%20of%20magnitude%20(time).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-12-12,954,369!2028-01-06,939,349!2026-01-15,408,369!2026-02-02,422,369!2026-01-23,374,329!2025-09-20,289,309!2027-02-21,702,349-->

Over {@{long periods of time}@}, the dynamics are {@{complicated by general relativity, dark energy, [inflation](cosmic%20inflation.md), etc.}@}, as explained above. <!--SR:!2026-01-22,413,369!2028-05-18,1081,369-->
