# filtration

__Filtration__ is {@{a physical [separation process](separation%20process.md) that separates [solid](solid.md) from [fluid](fluid.md) in a [mixture](mixture.md) using a _[filter medium](#filter%20medium)_}@}. Solid that cannot pass through is called the {@{_residue_}@} and fluid that passes through is called the {@{_filtrate_}@}.

## filter medium

A filter medium is {@{a material used to separate}@}.

There are two main types of filter media: {@{_surface filter_, a solid [sieve](sieve.md) that traps the solid with or without [filter paper](filter%20paper.md)}@}, and {@{_depth filter_, a bed of granular material retaining the solid as they pass through}@}.
