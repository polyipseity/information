# telescope

A __telescope__ is {@{a device used to observe distant objects by their emission, [absorption](absorption%20(electromagnetic%20radiation).md), or [reflection](reflection%20(physics).md) of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-05,520,310-->

## in space

- see: [space telescope](space%20telescope.md)

Since the [atmosphere](atmosphere%20of%20Earth.md) is {@{opaque for most of the electromagnetic spectrum, only a few bands can be observed from the Earth's surface}@}. These observable bands are {@{from visible to near-infrared and a portion of the radio-wave part of the spectrum}@}. For this reason there are {@{no X-ray or far-infrared ground-based telescopes}@} as these {@{have to be observed from orbit}@}. Even if a wavelength is observable from the ground, it might still be advantageous to place a telescope on a satellite due to issues such as {@{[clouds](cloud.md), [astronomical seeing](astronomical%20seeing.md) and [light pollution](light%20pollution.md#effect%20on%20astronomy)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-11-08,1215,350!2027-10-28,838,290!2028-05-10,919,290!2029-12-10,1426,310!2027-03-11,396,378-->

## by electromagnetic spectrum

### visible light

- see: [optical telescope](optical%20telescope.md) and [visible-light astronomy](visible-light%20astronomy.md)

There are {@{3}@} main optical types: {@{[refracting telescope](refracting%20telescope.md), [reflecting telescope](reflecting%20telescope.md), and [catadioptric telescope](catadioptric%20system.md#catadioptric%20telescopes)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-07-14,1127,350!2028-03-08,951,330-->

- [refracting telescope](refracting%20telescope.md) ::@:: use lens to form an image <!--SR:!2027-12-25,969,350!2029-04-12,1342,350-->
- [reflecting telescope](reflecting%20telescope.md) ::@:: use an arrangement of mirrors to form an image <!--SR:!2028-10-03,1192,350!2028-02-18,1010,350-->
- [catadioptric telescope](catadioptric%20system.md#catadioptric%20telescopes) ::@:: use mirrors combined with lens to form an image <!--SR:!2027-12-26,940,330!2031-05-02,1884,330-->
