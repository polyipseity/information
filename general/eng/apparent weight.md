# apparent weight

In [physics](physics.md), __apparent weight__ is {@{a property of objects that corresponds to how heavy an object _appears_ to be}@}. In many familiar situations, this is {@{the [reaction force given by the ground](ground%20reaction%20force.md) opposing the [force of gravity](gravity.md) on the object}@}. By contrast, ordinary [weight](weight.md) is {@{the force of gravity acting on the object}@}. When one is stationary, then {@{the force of gravity are balanced by the ground reaction force, so apparent weight equals weight}@}. However, they are different whenever {@{the force of gravity is not balanced by the reaction force}@}, such as {@{in an accelerating lift, or [free falling](free%20fall.md)}@}. This also means a "[weightless](weightlessness.md)" astronaut in [low Earth orbit](low%20Earth%20orbit.md) has {@{an apparent weight of zero (the astronaut is free falling), but has almost the same weight as he would have while standing on the ground}@}. <!--SR:!2027-01-01,686,330!2026-04-05,467,310!2028-06-14,1110,350!2025-07-04,269,330!2027-11-28,955,350!2025-08-31,320,330!2026-06-05,502,310-->
