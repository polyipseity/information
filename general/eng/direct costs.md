# direct costs

- See also: ::@:: [Indirect costs](indirect%20costs.md) and [Joint cost](joint%20cost.md) <!--SR:!2029-08-02,1276,350!2029-07-07,1255,350-->

{@{__Direct costs__}@}, in {@{accounting}@}, are {@{costs directly accountable to a [cost object](cost%20object.md)}@} \(such as {@{a particular project, facility, function, or product}@}\).<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {@{The equivalent nomenclature in economics}@} is {@{__specific cost__}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> Direct costs may be {@{either [fixed](fixed%20cost.md) or [variable](variable%20cost.md)}@}, but typically comprise {@{materials, labour, and specific expenses}@} such as, e.g. {@{a [royalty payment](royalty%20payment.md) to a [patent holder](patent%20holder.md) for a given production process}@},<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> all, {@{directly attributable to a cost object}@}. Thus by industry: <!--SR:!2026-02-11,287,330!2026-02-12,288,330!2029-06-26,1245,350!2029-06-29,1248,350!2026-02-18,292,330!2026-02-09,283,330!2029-08-03,1277,350!2026-02-05,282,330!2026-11-24,491,310!2026-02-13,289,330-->

- In construction, ::@:: the costs of materials, labor, equipment, etc., and all directly involved efforts or expenses for the cost object are direct costs. <!--SR:!2028-01-08,817,330!2028-01-29,834,330-->
- In manufacturing or other non-construction industries, ::@:: the portion of operating costs that is directly assignable to a specific product or process is a direct cost.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-07,284,330!2026-06-13,365,310-->
- In {@{[project management](project%20management.md)}@}, direct costs are {@{those for activities or services that benefit specific projects}@}, for example {@{salaries for project staff and materials required for a particular project}@}. Because {@{these activities are easily traced to projects}@}, their costs are {@{usually charged to projects on an item-by-item basis}@}. <!--SR:!2029-08-11,1284,350!2029-08-01,1276,350!2026-02-10,286,330!2026-02-17,291,330!2029-07-21,1266,350-->

By contrast, {@{[indirect costs](indirect%20costs.md)}@} are {@{costs not directly accountable to a cost object}@} \(such as {@{a particular project, facility, function or product}@}\). These include {@{administration, personnel and security costs}@}. {@{A [joint cost](joint%20cost.md)}@} is {@{a cost incurred in the production or delivery of multiple products or product lines}@}. For instance, in {@{[civil aviation](civil%20aviation.md)}@}, {@{substantial costs of a flight}@} \({@{pilots, fuel, wear and tear on the plane, landing and takeoff fees}@}\) are {@{a joint cost between carrying passengers and carrying freight}@}, and underlie {@{[economies of scope](economies%20of%20scope.md) across passenger and freight services}@}. By contrast, some costs are {@{specific to the services}@}, for instance, {@{meals and flight attendants}@} are {@{specific costs of carrying passengers}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-10,284,330!2026-02-19,293,330!2029-07-16,1263,350!2026-02-08,285,330!2026-02-08,285,330!2026-08-24,424,310!2029-07-08,1256,350!2026-02-14,290,330!2027-09-27,738,330!2029-07-22,1267,350!2026-02-05,282,330!2026-02-06,283,330!2029-07-16,1263,350!2026-02-16,290,330-->
