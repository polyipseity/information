>     1. Let's imagine {@{you have two infinite heat reservoirs}@}, one of {@{higher [temperature](temperature.md) $T_\mathrm{H}$ and one of lower [temperature](temperature.md) $T_\mathrm{C}$}@}. Your goal is to {@{create a heat engine that maximizes efficiency}@}, i.e. {@{max work per heat accepted}@}.
>     2. Intuitively, heat moves {@{from higher [temperature](temperature.md) to lower [temperature](temperature.md)}@} and not {@{in reverse}@}, so {@{the max amount of work we can extract}@} is {@{the energy difference between the two [temperatures](temperatures.md)}@}.
>     3. {@{Another requirement}@} is that we want to {@{run the heat engine indefinitely}@}, so we need the heat engine to {@{return to its starting state}@}.
>     4. Starting from {@{a gas of [temperature](temperature.md) $T_\mathrm{H}$ and [volume](volume.md) $V_0$}@}, we start {@{accepting heat from the hot reservoir, called $Q_\mathrm{H}$}@}. To {@{maximize work done}@}, all accepted heat {@{performs work and does not heat up the gas}@}. {@{The [temperature](temperature.md) remains $T_\mathrm{H}$}@}, but {@{the [volume](volume.md) increases}@}. Remember {@{$\delta W = \delta Q_\mathrm{H}$}@}.
>     5. Then we need to {@{change the gas temperature from $T_\mathrm{H}$ to $T_\mathrm{C}$}@}, as {@{a cooler gas}@} consumes {@{less work to be compressed}@}. To {@{maximize work}@}, {@{all the lost internal energy are converted to work}@}. Remember {@{$\delta W = \mathrm{d}U$}@}.
>     6. Now we need to {@{start compressing the gas back to its starting state}@}. That means we need to {@{decrease the [volume](volume.md) and increase the [temperature](temperature.md)}@}. {@{Compressing the gas at $T_\mathrm{C}$}@} takes {@{less work}@}, so we will use {@{work to compress the gas while keeping its [temperature](temperature.md) at $T_\mathrm{C}$}@}. That requires {@{dissipating the work into the cold reservoir}@} to {@{avoid the temperature increase, which we call $Q_\mathrm{C}$}@}. Remember {@{$\delta W = -\delta Q_\mathrm{C}$}@}.
>     7. We also need to {@{increase the [temperature](temperature.md) to $T_\mathrm{H}$}@} to {@{return the gas to its starting state}@}. To do so, instead of {@{compressing the gas to $V_0$ while keeping the [temperature](temperature.md) at $T_\mathrm{C}$}@}, we will use {@{the work that would have been dissipated as $Q_\mathrm{C}$}@} to {@{increase the [internal energy](internal%20energy.md) of the gas}@}, and thus {@{[temperature](temperature.md)}@}. Remember {@{$\delta W = -\mathrm{d}U$}@}.
>     8. Obviously, {@{step 5 and step 7 cancels out}@} as {@{the [internal energy](internal%20energy.md) of the gas returns to its original state}@}: {@{$\delta W = \mathrm{d}U - \mathrm{d}U = 0$}@}. That means {@{the only work produced comes from step 4 and 6}@}, which is {@{the difference between $Q_\mathrm{H}$ and $Q_\mathrm{C}$}@}: {@{$\delta W = \delta Q_\mathrm{H} - \delta Q_\mathrm{C}$}@}.
>     9. To {@{understand entropy}@}, consider {@{the [heat](heat.md) ratio $Q_\mathrm{H} / Q_\mathrm{C}$}@}. As {@{$Q_\mathrm{H}$ increases}@}, {@{more [volume](volume.md) is displaced}@}, so {@{more $Q_\mathrm{C}$ is needed to restore the [volume](volume.md)}@}. Heuristically, that means {@{the ratio}@} is only affected by {@{the [temperature](temperature.md) ratio $T_\mathrm{H}/T_\mathrm{C}$ but not the [volume](volume.md)}@}. So we can think of {@{[temperature](temperature.md)}@} as {@{characterizing the amount of [heat](heat.md) converted to [work](work%20(physics).md) per [volume](volume.md)}@}. Then {@{the inverse [temperature](temperature.md) $1/T$}@} characterizes {@{the amount of [volume](volume.md) displaced per [heat](heat.md) converted to [work](work%20(physics).md)}@}, or in other words, {@{how easy it is to displace [volume](volume.md)}@}. Compare it with {@{$\mathrm{d}S = \frac{\delta Q_\text{in} }T$}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-12,1323,350!2027-04-26,812,290!2026-04-14,594,310!2027-12-28,966,290!2027-05-06,887,330!2028-02-01,1025,270!2028-04-17,1041,290!2026-04-26,591,310!2026-02-18,188,230!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-08-29,11,307!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-04,17,327!2025-09-05,18,327!2025-09-05,18,327-->
