# indirect costs

{@{__Indirect costs__}@} are {@{costs that are not directly accountable to a [cost object](cost%20object.md)}@} \(such as {@{a particular project, facility, function or product}@}\). Like {@{[direct costs](direct%20costs.md)}@}, indirect costs may be {@{either [fixed](fixed%20cost.md) or [variable](variable%20cost.md)}@}. Indirect costs include {@{administration, [personnel](personnel.md) and security costs}@}. These are {@{those costs which are not directly related to production}@}. Some indirect costs may be {@{[overhead](overhead%20(business).md)}@}, but other overhead costs can be {@{directly attributed to a project and are direct costs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-16,291,330!2026-02-16,291,330!2026-02-17,292,330!2026-02-15,290,330!2026-02-17,292,330!2026-02-19,294,330!2026-02-15,290,330!2026-02-17,292,330!2026-02-19,294,330-->

There are {@{two types of indirect costs}@}. One are {@{the fixed indirect costs}@}, which are {@{unchanged for a particular project or company}@}, like {@{transportation of labor to the working site, building temporary roads, etc.}@} The other are {@{recurring indirect costs}@}, which {@{repeat for a particular company}@}, like {@{maintenance of [records](business%20record.md) or the payment of salaries}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-16,291,330!2026-02-19,294,330!2026-02-16,291,330!2026-02-15,290,330!2025-10-23,194,310!2026-02-19,294,330!2026-02-18,293,330-->

## indirect vs direct costs

{@{Most [cost estimates](cost%20estimate.md)}@} are {@{broken down into [direct costs](direct%20costs.md) and indirect costs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-19,294,330!2026-02-16,291,330-->

Direct costs are {@{directly attributable to the object}@}. In {@{construction}@}, {@{the costs of materials, labor, equipment, etc., and all directly involved efforts or expenses for the cost object}@} are direct costs. In {@{manufacturing or other non-construction industries}@} the portion of {@{operating costs that is directly assignable to a specific product or process}@} is a direct cost.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> Direct costs are {@{those for activities or services that benefit specific projects}@}, for example {@{salaries for project staff and materials required for a particular project}@}. Because {@{these activities are easily traced to projects}@}, their costs are {@{usually charged to projects on an item-by-item basis}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-17,292,330!2026-02-18,293,330!2025-08-28,155,310!2026-02-15,290,330!2026-02-18,293,330!2026-02-15,290,330!2026-02-11,286,330!2026-02-16,291,330!2026-02-17,292,330-->

{@{Indirect costs}@} are, {@{but not necessarily, not directly attributable to a cost object}@}. It should be {@{financially infeasible to do so}@}. Indirect costs are {@{typically allocated to a cost object on some basis}@}. In {@{construction}@}, {@{all costs which are required for completion of the installation, but are not directly attributable to the cost object}@} are indirect, such as {@{overhead}@}. In {@{manufacturing}@}, {@{costs not directly assignable to the end product or process}@} are indirect. These may be {@{costs for management, insurance, taxes, or maintenance}@}, for example.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> Indirect costs are {@{those for activities or services that benefit more than one project}@}. {@{Their precise benefits to a specific project}@} are {@{often difficult or impossible to trace}@}. For example, it may be difficult to determine {@{precisely how the activities of the director of an organization benefit a specific project}@}. Indirect costs do not {@{vary substantially within certain production volumes or other indicators of activity}@}, and so they may sometimes be {@{considered to be fixed costs}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-10,285,330!2025-10-20,191,310!2026-02-18,293,330!2026-02-18,293,330!2026-02-18,293,330!2025-10-09,185,310!2026-02-18,293,330!2026-02-14,289,330!2026-02-18,293,330!2025-10-11,187,310!2026-02-18,293,330!2026-02-15,290,330!2026-02-19,294,330!2026-02-17,292,330!2026-10-27,469,310!2026-02-19,294,330-->

It is possible to {@{justify the handling of almost any kind of cost as either direct or indirect}@}. {@{Labor costs, for example, can be indirect}@}, as in the case of {@{maintenance personnel and executive officers}@}; or {@{they can be direct}@}, as in the case of {@{project staff members}@}. Similarly, materials such as {@{miscellaneous supplies purchased in bulk—pencils, pens, paper}@}—are {@{typically handled as indirect costs}@}, while {@{materials required for specific projects}@} are {@{charged as direct costs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-16,291,330!2026-02-15,290,330!2026-02-15,290,330!2026-02-13,288,330!2025-10-10,186,310!2026-02-18,293,330!2026-02-15,290,330!2026-02-18,293,330!2026-02-16,291,330-->

Often, such as when {@{applying for funding under a grant}@}, indirect costs are {@{specified as a fixed percentage}@}, this percentage {@{having been negotiated in advance}@}. This is the case, for example, in {@{federally-funded research in the United States}@}. In this case, {@{the indirect costs percentage}@} is {@{specified relative to direct costs, not to the total request}@}. A grant {@{requesting \$100k in direct costs with an indirect cost rate of 50%}@}, for example, means that {@{the request will include an additional request for \$50k for indirect costs}@} for {@{a total request of \$150k}@}, as opposed to {@{a request for \$100k of indirect costs for a total request of \$200k}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-19,294,330!2026-02-16,291,330!2026-02-17,292,330!2026-02-17,292,330!2026-02-18,293,330!2026-02-17,292,330!2026-02-19,294,330!2026-02-17,292,330!2026-02-15,290,330!2026-02-15,290,330-->

## examples

{@{The same cost}@} can be {@{labeled as indirect in one industry and direct in another}@}. For example, {@{fuel cost in a telecom}@} is {@{usually allocated as an indirect cost}@}, while {@{for an airliner it is a direct cost}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-12,287,330!2026-02-16,291,330!2026-02-19,294,330!2026-02-19,294,330!2026-02-19,294,330-->

### costs usually charged directly

- Salary/wages
- Consultants
- Materials
- Tools
- Rent
- Transport
- Labour
- Direct materials
- PPC
- Any kind of subcontract ::@:: which is attributable to direct works but the specific company does not possess the required skill <!--SR:!2026-02-15,290,330!2026-02-16,291,330-->

### costs either charged directly or allocated indirectly

- Director's salary ::@:: \(this is usually an indirect cost\) <!--SR:!2026-02-18,293,330!2026-02-19,294,330-->
- Electricity ::@:: \(mostly if it needs allocation it is always indirect\) <!--SR:!2025-10-26,197,310!2026-02-16,291,330-->

Note that if {@{electricity is not used as primary source for production}@} then {@{electricity cost will be treated as utility and is always indirect}@}. For example, if {@{electricity is required to run the boiler which in turn generates steam}@}, then {@{electricity needs to be allocated directly}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-17,292,330!2025-10-22,193,310!2025-10-21,192,310!2026-02-17,292,330-->

### costs usually allocated indirectly

- Indirect costs related to transport
- Administration cost
- Selling & distribution cost
- Office cost
- Security cost
- Shipping and Postage
- Utilities and rent
