In [economics](economics.md), {@{a __necessity good__ or a __necessary good__}@} is {@{a type of [normal good](normal%20good.md)}@}. Necessity goods are product(s) and services that {@{consumers will buy regardless of the changes in their income levels}@}, therefore {@{making these products less sensitive to income change}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> As for {@{any other normal good}@}, an {@{income rise}@} will {@{lead to a rise in demand}@}, but {@{the increase for a necessity good is less than proportional to the rise in income}@}, so {@{the proportion of expenditure on these goods falls as income rises}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> If {@{income elasticity of demand is lower than unity}@}, it is {@{a necessity good}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> {@{This observation for food}@}, known as {@{[Engel's law](Engel's%20law.md)}@}, states that {@{as income rises, the proportion of income spent on food falls}@}, even if {@{absolute expenditure on food rises}@}. This makes {@{the [income elasticity](income%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md) of demand for food between zero and one}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-13,280,330!2025-11-23,289,330!2025-10-23,265,330!2025-10-20,262,330!2025-10-24,266,330!2029-01-02,1175,350!2025-10-16,258,330!2027-03-06,644,330!2025-10-18,260,330!2027-04-25,682,330!2025-10-19,261,330!2025-11-11,278,330!2025-10-21,263,330!2025-11-22,288,330!2027-03-13,651,330!2025-11-28,293,330-->

Some necessity goods are {@{produced by a [public utility](public%20utility.md)}@}. According to Investopedia, {@{stocks of private companies producing necessity goods}@} are known as {@{[defensive stocks](defensive%20stock.md)}@}. Defensive stocks are {@{stocks that provide a constant [dividend](dividend.md) and stable [earnings](profit%20(economics).md)}@} regardless of {@{the state of the overall stock market}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup><sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-12,279,330!2025-10-17,259,330!2025-11-29,294,330!2025-11-09,277,330!2025-11-24,290,330-->
