# chromosphere

A __chromosphere__ ("sphere of color") is {@{the second layer of a [star's atmosphere](stellar%20atmosphere.md), located above the [photosphere](photosphere.md) and below the [solar transition region](solar%20transition%20region.md) and [corona](stellar%20corona.md)}@}.

For the [Sun](Sun.md)'s chromosphere, the [temperature](temperature.md) {@{initially decreases from the inner boundary at about 6000&nbsp;K to a minimum of approximately 3800&nbsp;K, but then increasing to upwards of 35&nbsp;000&nbsp;K at the outer boundary with the [transition layer](solar%20transition%20region.md) of the [corona](stellar%20corona.md) (see [stellar corona § coronal heating problem](stellar%20corona.md#coronal%20heating%20problem))}@}.
