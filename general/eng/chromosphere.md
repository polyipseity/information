# chromosphere

A __chromosphere__ ("sphere of color") is {@{the second layer of a [star's atmosphere](stellar%20atmosphere.md), located above the [photosphere](photosphere.md) and below the [solar transition region](solar%20transition%20region.md) and [corona](stellar%20corona.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-01,386,290-->

For {@{the [Sun](Sun.md)'s chromosphere}@}, {@{the [temperature](temperature.md)}@} {@{initially decreases from the inner boundary at about 6000&nbsp;K to a minimum of approximately 3800&nbsp;K}@}, but then {@{increasing to upwards of 35&nbsp;000&nbsp;K at the outer boundary with the [transition layer](solar%20transition%20region.md) of the [corona](stellar%20corona.md)}@} \(see {@{[stellar corona ยง coronal heating problem](stellar%20corona.md#coronal%20heating%20problem)}@}\). <!--SR:!2027-06-28,643,250!2025-09-21,4,274!2025-09-21,4,274!2025-09-20,3,254!2025-09-21,4,274-->
