# astrophysical jet

An __astrophysical jet__ is {@{an [astronomical](astronomy.md) phenomenon where outflows of [ionised](ionization.md) matter are emitted as extended beams along the [axis of rotation](rotation.md)}@}. When {@{this greatly accelerated matter in the beam approaches the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md)}@}, astrophysical jets become {@{__relativistic jets__ as they show effects from [special relativity](special%20relativity.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-09-10,849,330!2027-09-30,853,330!2028-11-19,1207,350-->
