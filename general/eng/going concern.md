# going concern

A __going concern__ is {@{an accounting term for a [business](business.md) that is assumed will meet its financial obligations when they become due}@}. It functions {@{without the threat of [liquidation](liquidation.md) for the [foreseeable future](foreseeable%20future.md), which is usually regarded as at least the next 12 months or the specified accounting period (the longer of the two)}@}. The presumption of going concern for the business implies {@{the basic declaration of intention to keep operating its activities at least for the next year}@}, which is {@{a basic assumption for preparing [financial statements](financial%20statement.md) that comprehend the conceptual framework of the [IFRS](International%20Financial%20Reporting%20Standards.md)}@}. Hence, a declaration of going concern means that {@{the business has neither the intention nor the need to liquidate or to materially curtail the scale of its operations}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-04,218,330!2026-10-16,569,310!2025-10-11,298,330!2025-08-01,241,330!2025-06-29,210,310-->

Continuation of an entity as a going concern is {@{presumed as the basis for financial reporting unless and until the entity's liquidation becomes imminent}@}. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as {@{the _going concern_ basis of accounting}@}. If and when {@{an entity's liquidation becomes imminent}@}, financial statements are {@{prepared under the _liquidation basis_ of accounting}@} (Financial Accounting Standards Board, 2014<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup>). <!--SR:!2025-08-11,250,330!2025-09-28,289,330!2025-10-10,297,330!2025-08-26,262,330-->
