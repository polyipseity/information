{@{__Variable costing__}@} is {@{a [managerial accounting](managerial%20accounting.md) cost concept}@}. Under {@{this method}@}, {@{[manufacturing overhead](manufacturing%20overhead.md)}@} is {@{incurred in the period that a product is produced}@}. This addresses {@{the issue of [absorption costing](absorption%20costing.md)}@} that {@{allows [income](income.md) to rise as [production](production%20(economics).md) rises}@}. Under {@{an absorption cost method}@}, management can {@{push forward costs to the next period when products are sold}@}. This {@{artificially inflates profits in the period of production}@} by {@{incurring less cost than would be incurred under a variable costing system}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {@{Variable costing}@} is generally {@{not used for external reporting purposes}@}. Under {@{the [Tax Reform Act of 1986](Tax%20Reform%20Act%20of%201986.md)}@}, {@{[income statements](income%20statement.md)}@} must {@{use absorption costing to comply with [GAAP](generally%20accepted%20accounting%20principles.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-25,251,330!2026-06-24,251,330!2026-06-26,252,330!2026-06-11,240,330!2026-06-20,247,330!2026-06-27,253,330!2026-06-16,244,330!2026-06-02,232,330!2026-06-22,249,330!2026-06-10,239,330!2026-06-09,238,330!2026-06-17,245,330!2026-06-07,237,330!2026-06-12,241,330!2026-06-28,254,330!2026-06-06,236,330-->

{@{Variable costing}@} is {@{a costing method}@} that {@{includes only variable manufacturing costs}@}—{@{direct materials, direct labor, and variable manufacturing overhead}@}—in {@{unit product costs}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-06-23,250,330!2026-05-28,227,330!2026-05-29,228,330!2026-06-14,242,330!2025-12-13,81,355-->
