# shutdown

- For other uses, see [Shutdown](shutdown%20(disambiguation).md).

{@{A firm will choose to implement a __shutdown__ of [production](production%20(economics).md)}@} when {@{the [revenue](revenue.md) received from the sale of the [goods or services](goods%20and%20services.md) produced cannot even cover the [variable costs](variable%20cost.md) of production}@}. In that situation, the firm will {@{experience a higher loss when it produces, compared to not producing at all}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-03,261,330!2025-08-22,155,310!2026-01-26,280,330-->

Technically, shutdown occurs {@{if [average revenue](total%20revenue.md) is below [average variable cost](average%20variable%20cost.md) at the profit-maximizing positive level of output}@}. {@{Producing anything}@} would {@{not generate enough revenue to offset the associated variable costs}@}; {@{producing some output}@} would {@{add further costs in excess of revenues to the costs inevitably being incurred \(the [fixed costs](fixed%20cost.md)\)}@}. By {@{not producing, the firm loses only the fixed costs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-29,282,330!2026-01-02,260,330!2026-01-09,267,330!2027-04-30,626,330!2026-02-01,285,330!2025-12-15,247,330-->

## explanation

{@{The goal of a firm}@} is {@{to maximize profits or minimize losses}@}. The firm can achieve this goal by {@{following two rules}@}. First, the firm should {@{operate, if at all, at the level of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost}@}. Second, the firm should {@{shut down rather than operate if it can reduce losses by doing so}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-16,248,330!2025-12-14,246,330!2025-12-15,247,330!2026-01-06,264,330!2025-12-11,244,330-->

> {@{The optimal quantity of output for the perfect competitor}@} is {@{where marginal cost \(MC\) equals marginal revenue \(MR\)}@}. In the case depicted, since {@{at this quantity of output}@} {@{average revenue \(AR\) exceeds average variable cost \(not shown, but below average total cost \(ATC\)\)}@}, the firm in this situation {@{does not shut down}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-08,266,330!2027-05-17,637,330!2025-10-15,192,310!2026-01-21,276,330!2026-01-04,262,330!2025-12-20,251,330-->

Generally, a firm must have {@{revenue $R\geq TC$, total costs, in order to avoid losses}@}. However, in {@{the short run, all fixed costs are [sunk costs](sunk%20cost.md)}@}. {@{Netting out fixed costs}@}, a firm then {@{faces the requirement that $R\geq VC$ \(total revenue equals or exceeds variable costs\), in order to continue operating}@}. Thus, a firm will find it {@{profitable in the short run to operate so long as the market price equals or exceeds average variable cost \(_p ≥ AVC_\)}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> Conventionally stated, {@{the shutdown rule}@} is: "{@{in the short run a firm should continue to operate}@} {@{if price equals or exceeds average variable costs}@}."<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> Restated, the rule is that to {@{produce in the short run a firm must earn sufficient revenue to cover its variable costs}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> {@{The rationale for the rule}@} is straightforward. By shutting down, a firm {@{avoids all variable costs}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> However, the firm {@{must still pay fixed costs}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> Because {@{fixed costs must be paid regardless of whether a firm operates}@} they should {@{not be considered in deciding whether to produce or shut down}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-14,271,330!2026-02-05,288,330!2026-02-01,285,330!2025-12-29,258,330!2025-12-24,255,330!2026-01-25,279,330!2026-02-06,289,330!2026-01-08,265,330!2026-01-27,281,330!2025-12-27,256,330!2026-02-05,288,330!2025-12-25,255,330!2026-01-30,283,330!2025-12-16,248,330-->

Thus in {@{determining whether to shut down}@} a firm should {@{compare total revenue to total variable costs \(VC\) rather than total costs \(FC \(fixed costs\) + VC\)}@}. If {@{the revenue the firm is receiving is greater than its variable cost \(R \> VC\)}@} then the firm is {@{covering all variable cost plus there is additional revenue which partially or entirely offsets fixed costs}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> \({@{The size of the fixed costs is irrelevant}@} as {@{it is a [sunk cost](sunk%20cost.md)}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> {@{The same consideration is used}@} whether fixed costs are {@{one dollar or one million dollars}@}.\) On the other hand if {@{VC \> R}@} then the firm is {@{not even covering its short-run production costs and it should immediately shut down}@}. The rule is conventionally stated {@{in terms of price \(average revenue\) and average variable costs}@}. The rules are {@{equivalent}@}—if {@{one divides both sides of inequality TR \> VC \(total revenue exceeds variable costs\) by the output quantity Q}@} one {@{obtains P \> AVC \(price exceeds average variable cost\)}@}. If {@{the firm decides to operate}@} it will {@{produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs}@} because these conditions {@{insure profit maximization \(or equivalently, when profit is negative, loss minimization\)}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-11,293,330!2026-02-07,290,330!2026-02-12,294,330!2026-01-17,273,330!2025-12-22,253,330!2025-12-23,254,330!2026-01-03,261,330!2025-12-23,253,330!2026-01-24,278,330!2025-12-18,249,330!2025-12-22,253,330!2026-01-17,273,330!2025-12-19,250,330!2026-01-06,264,330!2026-01-31,284,330!2026-01-10,268,330!2025-12-10,243,330-->

Another way to state the rule is that a firm should {@{compare the profits from operating to those realized if it shut down}@}, and {@{select the option that produces the greater profit \(positive or negative\)}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup><sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> {@{A firm that is shut down}@} is {@{generating zero revenue and incurring no variable costs}@}. However {@{the firm still incurs fixed cost}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> So the firm's {@{profit equals the negative of fixed costs or \(–FC\)}@}.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> {@{An operating firm}@} is {@{generating revenue, incurring variable costs and paying fixed costs}@}. The operating firm's {@{profit is R – VC – FC}@}.

Thus, if {@{R ≥ VC then the firm should operate}@}. If {@{R \< VC the firm should shut down}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-01,285,330!2025-12-14,246,330!2026-01-19,274,330!2026-01-02,260,330!2025-12-19,251,330!2025-12-17,248,330!2025-12-16,247,330!2025-12-22,253,330!2026-01-07,264,330!2025-12-20,251,330!2026-01-25,279,330!2025-12-25,255,330!2025-12-25,255,330!2026-01-29,282,330!2025-12-22,252,330-->

### monopolist shutdown rule

{@{A monopolist}@} should {@{shut down when price \(average revenue\) is less than average variable cost for every output level}@};<sup>[\[18\]](#^ref-18)</sup> in other words, {@{it should shut down}@} {@{if the demand curve is entirely below the average variable cost curve}@}.<sup>[\[19\]](#^ref-19)</sup> Under these circumstances, even at {@{the profit-maximizing level of output \(where MR = MC, marginal revenue equals marginal cost\)}@} {@{average revenue would be lower than average variable costs}@} and the monopolist would {@{be better off shutting down in the short run}@}.<sup>[\[20\]](#^ref-20)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-03,286,330!2026-01-24,278,330!2025-12-21,252,330!2025-12-19,251,330!2025-12-17,249,330!2026-01-16,272,330!2025-12-24,254,330-->

### sunk costs

{@{An implicit assumption of the above rules}@} is that {@{all fixed costs are sunk costs}@}. However, there can be {@{physical assets whose cost during production is fixed}@} but {@{which have a salvage value which can be obtained if there is a shutdown}@}. When {@{some costs are sunk and some are not sunk}@}, total fixed costs \(TFC\) {@{equal sunk fixed costs \(SFC\) plus non-sunk fixed costs \(NSFC\) or TFC = SFC + NSFC}@}. When {@{some fixed costs are non-sunk}@}, {@{the shutdown rule must be modified}@}. To {@{illustrate the new rule}@} it is {@{necessary to define a new cost curve}@}, {@{the average non-sunk cost curve, or ANSC}@}. The ANSC {@{equals the average variable costs plus the average non-sunk fixed cost or ANSC = AVC + ANFC}@}. The new rule then becomes: if {@{the price is greater than the minimum average cost, produce}@}; if {@{the price is between minimum average cost and minimum ANSC, produce}@}; and if {@{the price is less than minimum ANSC for all levels of production, shut down}@}.<sup>[\[21\]](#^ref-21)</sup> If {@{all fixed costs are non-sunk}@}, then {@{\(a competitive\) firm would shut down if the price were below average total costs}@}.<sup>[\[22\]](#^ref-22)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-29,258,330!2026-01-26,280,330!2025-12-25,255,330!2026-01-20,276,330!2025-10-02,183,310!2025-12-19,251,330!2025-12-10,243,330!2026-01-21,276,330!2026-02-09,291,330!2025-12-18,250,330!2026-02-08,290,330!2025-12-18,250,330!2026-01-05,263,330!2026-01-21,276,330!2025-12-19,250,330!2026-01-15,272,330!2026-02-02,285,330-->

## short-run shutdown compared to long-run exit

{@{A decision to shut down}@} means that {@{the firm is temporarily suspending production}@}.<sup>[\[23\]](#^ref-23)</sup> It does not mean that {@{the firm is going out of business \([exiting](exit%20(economics).md) the industry\)}@}.<sup>[\[24\]](#^ref-24)</sup> If {@{market conditions improve, due to prices increasing or production costs falling}@}, {@{the firm can resume production}@}. {@{Shutting down}@} is {@{a short-run decision}@}.<sup>[\[25\]](#^ref-25)</sup> {@{A firm that has shut down}@} is {@{not producing, but it still retains its capital assets}@}; however, the firm {@{cannot leave the industry or avoid its fixed costs in the short run}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-11,244,330!2025-12-14,246,330!2026-02-11,293,330!2025-12-12,245,330!2026-01-13,270,330!2026-01-10,267,330!2025-12-23,254,330!2026-02-09,291,330!2026-01-08,266,330!2026-01-26,280,330-->

However, a firm will {@{not choose to incur losses indefinitely}@}. In {@{the long run}@}, the firm will {@{have to decide whether to continue in business or to leave the industry and pursue profits elsewhere}@}. {@{Exit}@} is {@{a long-term decision}@}. {@{A firm that has exited an industry}@} has {@{avoided all commitments and freed all capital for use in more profitable enterprises}@}.<sup>[\[26\]](#^ref-26)</sup> {@{A firm that exits an industry}@} {@{earns no revenue but it incurs no costs, fixed or variable}@}.<sup>[\[27\]](#^ref-27)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-14,191,310!2025-12-13,246,330!2025-12-24,255,330!2026-02-01,285,330!2026-01-07,265,330!2025-12-24,255,330!2026-01-27,281,330!2025-12-24,255,330!2025-12-23,254,330-->

{@{The long-run decision}@} is based on {@{the relationship of the price P and long-run average costs LRAC}@}.<sup>[\[28\]](#^ref-28)</sup> If {@{P ≥ LRAC then the firm will not exit the industry}@}. If {@{P \< LRAC, then the firm will exit the industry}@}. {@{These comparisons will be made}@} after the firm has {@{made the necessary and feasible long-term adjustments}@}.<sup>[\[29\]](#^ref-29)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-09,267,330!2026-02-03,286,330!2026-01-29,282,330!2026-01-16,272,330!2026-01-19,275,330!2026-02-04,287,330-->

In {@{the long run}@} a firm {@{operates where marginal revenue equals long-run marginal costs}@}, but {@{only if it decides to remain in the industry}@}.<sup>[\[30\]](#^ref-30)</sup> Thus {@{a perfectly competitive firm's long-run supply curve}@} is {@{the long-run marginal cost curve above the minimum point of the long-run average cost curve}@}.<sup>[\[31\]](#^ref-31)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-27,256,330!2026-02-01,285,330!2026-01-30,283,330!2026-01-11,268,330!2025-12-30,259,330-->

## calculating the shutdown point

{@{The short run shutdown point}@} {@{for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average variable cost curve}@}. Assume that {@{a firm's total cost function}@} is {@{TC = Q<sup>3</sup> -5Q<sup>2</sup> +60Q +125}@}. Then {@{its variable cost function}@} is {@{Q<sup>3</sup> –5Q<sup>2</sup> +60Q}@}, and {@{its average variable cost function}@} is {@{\(Q<sup>3</sup> –5Q<sup>2</sup> +60Q\)/Q= Q<sup>2</sup> –5Q + 60}@}. {@{The slope of the average variable cost curve}@} is {@{the derivative of the latter, namely 2Q – 5}@}. {@{Equating this to zero to find the minimum}@} {@{gives Q = 2.5}@}, at which {@{level of output average variable cost is 53.75}@}. Thus if {@{the market price of the product drops below 53.75, the firm will choose to shut down production}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-10,292,330!2026-01-20,275,330!2025-12-21,252,330!2025-12-17,249,330!2025-12-23,254,330!2026-01-27,281,330!2026-02-12,294,330!2025-12-21,252,330!2025-12-30,259,330!2026-02-07,290,330!2026-01-09,266,330!2026-02-04,287,330!2026-02-11,293,330!2026-01-25,279,330-->

{@{The long run shutdown point}@} {@{for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average total cost curve}@}. Assume that {@{a firm's total cost function}@} is {@{the same as in the above example}@}. To {@{find the shutdown point in the long run}@}, first {@{take the derivative of ATC and then set it to zero and solve for Q}@}. After {@{getting Q plug it into the MC to get the price}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-31,258,330!2026-01-24,278,330!2026-02-02,285,330!2025-12-28,257,330!2025-12-20,251,330!2026-01-21,276,330!2026-02-08,290,330-->

8. This version of the rule implicitly assumes that the firm has incurred sunk costs which are being amortized and treated as fixed costs, or that fixed costs equal sunk costs. This assumption does not always hold. Sunk costs may have been incurred and paid for, or the cost of fixed inputs may be partially recoverable, through sale and salvage. If all fixed costs are recoverable, then the firm should shut down if price drops below average total costs rather than average variable costs.
