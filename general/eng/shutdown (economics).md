# shutdown

- For other uses, see [Shutdown](shutdown%20(disambiguation).md).

{@{A firm will choose to implement a __shutdown__ of [production](production%20(economics).md)}@} when {@{the [revenue](revenue.md) received from the sale of the [goods or services](goods%20and%20services.md) produced cannot even cover the [variable costs](variable%20cost.md) of production}@}. In that situation, the firm will {@{experience a higher loss when it produces, compared to not producing at all}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-09,1191,350!2027-06-18,665,330!2029-08-04,1280,350-->

Technically, shutdown occurs {@{if [average revenue](total%20revenue.md) is below [average variable cost](average%20variable%20cost.md) at the profit-maximizing positive level of output}@}. {@{Producing anything}@} would {@{not generate enough revenue to offset the associated variable costs}@}; {@{producing some output}@} would {@{add further costs in excess of revenues to the costs inevitably being incurred \(the [fixed costs](fixed%20cost.md)\)}@}. By {@{not producing, the firm loses only the fixed costs}@}. <!--SR:!2029-08-13,1289,350!2029-03-31,1182,350!2029-05-16,1216,350!2027-04-30,626,330!2029-08-22,1298,350!2029-01-11,1123,350-->

## explanation

{@{The goal of a firm}@} is {@{to maximize profits or minimize losses}@}. The firm can achieve this goal by {@{following two rules}@}. First, the firm should {@{operate, if at all, at the level of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost}@}. Second, the firm should {@{shut down rather than operate if it can reduce losses by doing so}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-01-21,1132,350!2029-01-06,1119,350!2029-01-17,1129,350!2029-05-05,1205,350!2028-12-29,1114,350-->

Generally, a firm must have {@{revenue $R\geq TC$, total costs, in order to avoid losses}@}. However, in {@{the short run, all fixed costs are [sunk costs](sunk%20cost.md)}@}. {@{Netting out fixed costs}@}, a firm then {@{faces the requirement that $R\geq VC$ \(total revenue equals or exceeds variable costs\), in order to continue operating}@}. Thus, a firm will find it {@{profitable in the short run to operate so long as the market price equals or exceeds average variable cost \(_p ≥ AVC_\)}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> Conventionally stated, {@{the shutdown rule}@} is: "{@{in the short run a firm should continue to operate}@} {@{if price equals or exceeds average variable costs}@}."<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> Restated, the rule is that to {@{produce in the short run a firm must earn sufficient revenue to cover its variable costs}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> {@{The rationale for the rule}@} is straightforward. By shutting down, a firm {@{avoids all variable costs}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> However, the firm {@{must still pay fixed costs}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> Because {@{fixed costs must be paid regardless of whether a firm operates}@} they should {@{not be considered in deciding whether to produce or shut down}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-05-31,1231,350!2029-09-14,1317,350!2029-08-23,1299,350!2029-03-24,1175,350!2029-03-07,1158,350!2029-07-22,1274,350!2029-09-20,1322,350!2029-05-06,1206,350!2029-08-05,1281,350!2029-03-15,1166,350!2029-09-13,1316,350!2029-03-16,1167,350!2029-08-15,1291,350!2028-03-15,820,330-->

Thus in {@{determining whether to shut down}@} a firm should {@{compare total revenue to total variable costs \(VC\) rather than total costs \(FC \(fixed costs\) + VC\)}@}. If {@{the revenue the firm is receiving is greater than its variable cost \(R \> VC\)}@} then the firm is {@{covering all variable cost plus there is additional revenue which partially or entirely offsets fixed costs}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> \({@{The size of the fixed costs is irrelevant}@} as {@{it is a [sunk cost](sunk%20cost.md)}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> {@{The same consideration is used}@} whether fixed costs are {@{one dollar or one million dollars}@}.\) On the other hand if {@{VC \> R}@} then the firm is {@{not even covering its short-run production costs and it should immediately shut down}@}. The rule is conventionally stated {@{in terms of price \(average revenue\) and average variable costs}@}. The rules are {@{equivalent}@}—if {@{one divides both sides of inequality TR \> VC \(total revenue exceeds variable costs\) by the output quantity Q}@} one {@{obtains P \> AVC \(price exceeds average variable cost\)}@}. If {@{the firm decides to operate}@} it will {@{produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs}@} because these conditions {@{insure profit maximization \(or equivalently, when profit is negative, loss minimization\)}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-11,293,330!2029-09-25,1326,350!2026-02-12,294,330!2029-06-14,1244,350!2029-03-01,1152,350!2029-03-12,1163,350!2029-04-06,1188,350!2029-02-27,1150,350!2029-07-13,1266,350!2029-01-27,1136,350!2029-03-03,1154,350!2029-06-17,1247,350!2029-02-05,1144,350!2029-04-30,1200,350!2029-08-20,1296,350!2029-05-24,1224,350!2028-12-19,1105,350-->

Another way to state the rule is that a firm should {@{compare the profits from operating to those realized if it shut down}@}, and {@{select the option that produces the greater profit \(positive or negative\)}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup><sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> {@{A firm that is shut down}@} is {@{generating zero revenue and incurring no variable costs}@}.

If {@{R \< VC the firm should shut down}@}. <!--SR:!2029-08-21,1297,350!2029-01-04,1117,350!2029-06-23,1248,350!2029-04-01,1183,350!2029-02-06,1145,350!2029-01-18,1128,350!2029-01-15,1126,350!2029-02-28,1151,350!2029-05-01,1201,350!2029-02-05,1143,350!2029-07-24,1276,350!2029-03-07,1158,350!2029-03-11,1162,350!2029-08-11,1287,350!2029-02-24,1147,350-->

### monopolist shutdown rule

{@{A monopolist}@} should {@{shut down when price \(average revenue\) is less than average variable cost for every output level}@};<sup>[\[18\]](#^ref-18)</sup> in other words, {@{it should shut down}@} {@{if the demand curve is entirely below the average variable cost curve}@}.<sup>[\[19\]](#^ref-19)</sup> Under these circumstances, even at {@{the profit-maximizing level of output \(where MR = MC, marginal revenue equals marginal cost\)}@} {@{average revenue would be lower than average variable costs}@} and the monopolist would {@{be better off shutting down in the short run}@}.<sup>[\[20\]](#^ref-20)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-09-01,1306,350!2029-07-11,1264,350!2029-02-15,1152,350!2029-02-07,1146,350!2029-01-26,1136,350!2029-06-14,1245,350!2029-03-06,1157,350-->

### sunk costs

{@{An implicit assumption of the above rules}@} is that {@{all fixed costs are sunk costs}@}. However, there can be {@{physical assets whose cost during production is fixed}@} but {@{which have a salvage value which can be obtained if there is a shutdown}@}. When {@{some costs are sunk and some are not sunk}@}, total fixed costs \(TFC\) {@{equal sunk fixed costs \(SFC\) plus non-sunk fixed costs \(NSFC\) or TFC = SFC + NSFC}@}. When {@{some fixed costs are non-sunk}@}, {@{the shutdown rule must be modified}@}. To {@{illustrate the new rule}@} it is {@{necessary to define a new cost curve}@}, {@{the average non-sunk cost curve, or ANSC}@}. The ANSC {@{equals the average variable costs plus the average non-sunk fixed cost or ANSC = AVC + ANFC}@}. The new rule then becomes: if {@{the price is greater than the minimum average cost, produce}@}; if {@{the price is between minimum average cost and minimum ANSC, produce}@}; and if {@{the price is less than minimum ANSC for all levels of production, shut down}@}.<sup>[\[21\]](#^ref-21)</sup> If {@{all fixed costs are non-sunk}@}, then {@{\(a competitive\) firm would shut down if the price were below average total costs}@}.<sup>[\[22\]](#^ref-22)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-03-23,1174,350!2029-07-29,1274,350!2029-03-08,1159,350!2029-07-01,1256,350!2027-12-01,790,330!2029-02-03,1142,350!2028-12-20,1106,350!2029-06-29,1254,350!2029-09-29,1328,350!2029-01-28,1137,350!2029-09-24,1324,350!2029-01-30,1139,350!2029-04-27,1197,350!2029-07-02,1257,350!2029-02-04,1143,350!2029-06-07,1238,350!2029-08-27,1301,350-->

## short-run shutdown compared to long-run exit

{@{A decision to shut down}@} means that {@{the firm is temporarily suspending production}@}.<sup>[\[23\]](#^ref-23)</sup> It does not mean that {@{the firm is going out of business \([exiting](exit%20(economics).md) the industry\)}@}.<sup>[\[24\]](#^ref-24)</sup> If {@{market conditions improve, due to prices increasing or production costs falling}@}, {@{the firm can resume production}@}. {@{Shutting down}@} is {@{a short-run decision}@}.<sup>[\[25\]](#^ref-25)</sup> {@{A firm that has shut down}@} is {@{not producing, but it still retains its capital assets}@}; however, the firm {@{cannot leave the industry or avoid its fixed costs in the short run}@}. <!--SR:!2028-12-23,1108,350!2029-01-07,1120,350!2026-02-11,293,330!2029-01-01,1116,350!2029-05-28,1228,350!2029-05-15,1215,350!2029-03-03,1154,350!2029-09-30,1329,350!2029-05-12,1212,350!2029-08-01,1277,350-->

However, a firm will {@{not choose to incur losses indefinitely}@}. In {@{the long run}@}, the firm will {@{have to decide whether to continue in business or to leave the industry and pursue profits elsewhere}@}. {@{Exit}@} is {@{a long-term decision}@}. {@{A firm that has exited an industry}@} has {@{avoided all commitments and freed all capital for use in more profitable enterprises}@}.<sup>[\[26\]](#^ref-26)</sup> {@{A firm that exits an industry}@} {@{earns no revenue but it incurs no costs, fixed or variable}@}.<sup>[\[27\]](#^ref-27)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-01-15,823,330!2029-01-08,1122,350!2029-03-11,1162,350!2029-08-26,1302,350!2029-05-07,1207,350!2029-03-09,1160,350!2029-08-03,1279,350!2029-03-10,1161,350!2029-03-05,1156,350-->

{@{The long-run decision}@} is based on {@{the relationship of the price P and long-run average costs LRAC}@}.<sup>[\[28\]](#^ref-28)</sup> If {@{P ≥ LRAC then the firm will not exit the industry}@}. If {@{P \< LRAC, then the firm will exit the industry}@}. {@{These comparisons will be made}@} after the firm has {@{made the necessary and feasible long-term adjustments}@}.<sup>[\[29\]](#^ref-29)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-05-14,1214,350!2029-09-02,1307,350!2029-08-14,1290,350!2029-06-13,1244,350!2029-06-27,1252,350!2029-09-08,1312,350-->

In {@{the long run}@} a firm {@{operates where marginal revenue equals long-run marginal costs}@}, but {@{only if it decides to remain in the industry}@}.<sup>[\[30\]](#^ref-30)</sup> Thus {@{a perfectly competitive firm's long-run supply curve}@} is {@{the long-run marginal cost curve above the minimum point of the long-run average cost curve}@}.<sup>[\[31\]](#^ref-31)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-03-17,1168,350!2029-08-27,1303,350!2029-08-16,1292,350!2029-05-23,1223,350!2029-03-27,1178,350-->

## calculating the shutdown point

{@{The short run shutdown point}@} {@{for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average variable cost curve}@}. Assume that {@{a firm's total cost function}@} is {@{TC = Q<sup>3</sup> -5Q<sup>2</sup> +60Q +125}@}. Then {@{its variable cost function}@} is {@{Q<sup>3</sup> –5Q<sup>2</sup> +60Q}@}, and {@{its average variable cost function}@} is {@{\(Q<sup>3</sup> –5Q<sup>2</sup> +60Q\)/Q= Q<sup>2</sup> –5Q + 60}@}. {@{The slope of the average variable cost curve}@} is {@{the derivative of the latter, namely 2Q – 5}@}. {@{Equating this to zero to find the minimum}@} {@{gives Q = 2.5}@}, at which {@{level of output average variable cost is 53.75}@}. Thus if {@{the market price of the product drops below 53.75, the firm will choose to shut down production}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-10,292,330!2029-06-24,1249,350!2029-02-14,1151,350!2029-01-25,1135,350!2029-03-04,1155,350!2029-08-06,1282,350!2026-02-12,294,330!2029-02-13,1150,350!2029-03-26,1177,350!2029-09-24,1325,350!2029-05-08,1208,350!2029-09-09,1313,350!2026-02-11,293,330!2029-07-16,1268,350-->

{@{The long run shutdown point}@} {@{for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average total cost curve}@}. Assume that {@{a firm's total cost function}@} is {@{the same as in the above example}@}. To {@{find the shutdown point in the long run}@}, first {@{take the derivative of ATC and then set it to zero and solve for Q}@}. After {@{getting Q plug it into the MC to get the price}@}. <!--SR:!2029-03-22,1173,350!2029-07-14,1267,350!2029-08-26,1300,350!2029-03-19,1170,350!2029-02-03,1141,350!2029-06-28,1253,350!2029-09-23,1323,350-->

This assumption does not always hold. Sunk costs may have been incurred and paid for, or the cost of fixed inputs may be partially recoverable, through sale and salvage.
