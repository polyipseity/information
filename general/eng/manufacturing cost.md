{@{__Manufacturing cost__}@} is {@{the sum of costs of all resources consumed in the process of making a product}@}. The manufacturing cost is {@{classified into three categories}@}: {@{[direct materials cost](direct%20materials%20cost.md), direct [labor cost](labor%20cost.md) and manufacturing [overhead](overhead%20(business).md)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> It is a factor in {@{[total delivery cost](total%20delivery%20cost.md)}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-04-17,55,310!2025-02-22,15,290!2025-02-23,16,290!2025-02-23,16,290!2025-04-19,57,310-->

## direct materials cost

{@{Direct materials}@} are {@{the [raw materials](raw%20material.md) that become a part of the finished product}@}. Manufacturing {@{adds value to raw materials}@} by {@{applying a chain of operations to maintain a deliverable product}@}. There are {@{many operations that can be applied to raw materials}@} such as {@{[welding](welding.md), cutting and [painting](painting.md)}@}. It is important to {@{differentiate between direct materials and indirect materials}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-20,58,310!2025-02-22,15,290!2025-04-18,56,310!2025-02-22,15,290!2025-02-22,15,290!2025-02-22,15,290!2025-02-23,16,290-->

## direct labour cost

{@{The direct labour cost}@} is {@{the cost of workers who can be easily identified with the unit of production}@}. {@{Types of labour who are considered to be part of the direct labour cost}@} are {@{the assembly workers on an [assembly line](assembly%20line.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-16,54,310!2025-03-20,31,270!2025-02-22,15,290!2025-02-23,16,290-->

## manufacturing overhead

{@{Manufacturing overhead}@} is {@{any manufacturing cost that is neither direct materials cost nor direct labour cost}@}. Manufacturing overhead includes {@{all charges that provide support to manufacturing}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-22,15,290!2025-02-23,16,290!2025-04-16,54,310-->

### manufacturing overhead includes

1. Indirect labour cost: ::@:: The indirect labour cost is the cost associated with workers, such as supervisors and [material handling](material%20handling.md) team, who are not directly involved in the production. <!--SR:!2025-04-05,43,290!2025-02-23,16,290-->
2. Indirect materials cost: ::@:: Indirect materials cost is the cost associated with consumables, such as lubricants, [grease](grease%20(lubricant).md), and [water](water.md), that are not used as raw materials. <!--SR:!2025-02-23,16,290!2025-04-07,47,290-->
3. Other indirect manufacturing cost: ::@:: includes machine depreciation, [land rent](land%20rent.md#land%20rent), [property insurance](property%20insurance.md), [electricity](electricity.md), freight and transportation, or any expenses that keep the [factory](factory.md) operating. <!--SR:!2025-03-04,19,250!2025-03-21,33,270-->
