{@{__Manufacturing cost__}@} is {@{the sum of costs of all resources consumed in the process of making a product}@}. The manufacturing cost is {@{classified into three categories}@}: {@{[direct materials cost](direct%20materials%20cost.md), direct [labor cost](labor%20cost.md) and manufacturing [overhead](overhead%20(business).md)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> It is a factor in {@{[total delivery cost](total%20delivery%20cost.md)}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-13,240,330!2026-01-09,261,330!2026-02-08,285,330!2025-10-25,196,310!2025-12-26,251,330-->

## direct materials cost

{@{Direct materials}@} are {@{the [raw materials](raw%20material.md) that become a part of the finished product}@}. Manufacturing {@{adds value to raw materials}@} by {@{applying a chain of operations to maintain a deliverable product}@}. There are {@{many operations that can be applied to raw materials}@} such as {@{[welding](welding.md), cutting and [painting](painting.md)}@}. It is important to {@{differentiate between direct materials and indirect materials}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-30,254,330!2026-01-26,275,330!2025-12-17,243,330!2026-01-17,268,330!2026-01-01,255,330!2025-10-09,183,310!2026-02-14,290,330-->

## direct labour cost

{@{The direct labour cost}@} is {@{the cost of workers who can be easily identified with the unit of production}@}. {@{Types of labour who are considered to be part of the direct labour cost}@} are {@{the assembly workers on an [assembly line](assembly%20line.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-01,228,330!2026-11-04,476,310!2025-10-12,186,310!2026-02-20,294,330-->

## manufacturing overhead

{@{Manufacturing overhead}@} is {@{any manufacturing cost that is neither direct materials cost nor direct labour cost}@}. Manufacturing overhead includes {@{all charges that provide support to manufacturing}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-19,269,330!2026-01-30,276,330!2025-12-02,229,330-->

### manufacturing overhead includes

1. Indirect labour cost: ::@:: The indirect labour cost is the cost associated with workers, such as supervisors and [material handling](material%20handling.md) team, who are not directly involved in the production. <!--SR:!2025-09-27,175,310!2026-02-04,281,330-->
2. Indirect materials cost: ::@:: Indirect materials cost is the cost associated with consumables, such as lubricants, [grease](grease%20(lubricant).md), and [water](water.md), that are not used as raw materials. <!--SR:!2026-02-05,282,330!2025-10-13,189,310-->
3. Other indirect manufacturing cost: ::@:: includes machine depreciation, [land rent](land%20rent.md#land%20rent), [property insurance](property%20insurance.md), [electricity](electricity.md), freight and transportation, or any expenses that keep the [factory](factory.md) operating. <!--SR:!2025-09-29,162,270!2025-07-23,124,290-->
