# Tropic of Capricorn

The __Tropic of Capricorn__, also known as {@{the __Southern Tropic__}@}, is {@{the [Earth](Earth.md)'s [southernmost](south.md) circle of [latitude](latitude.md) where the [Sun](Sun.md) can be seen [directly overhead](subsolar%20point.md)}@}. This occurs on {@{the [December solstice](December%20solstice.md)}@}. The Sun also {@{touches 90 degrees below the horizon ([nadir](nadir.md)) on the [June solstice](June%20solstice.md) in locations along the Tropic of Capricorn}@}. Its [northern](north.md) equivalent is {@{the [Tropic of Cancer](Tropic%20of%20Cancer.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-04,256,330!2025-06-19,269,330!2026-07-01,499,310!2025-03-29,188,310!2025-03-26,188,310-->

Using a continuously updated formula, the circle is {@{currently 23°26′10.0″ (or 23.43611°) [south](south.md) of the [equator](equator.md)}@}, which approximates {@{[Earth](Earth.md)'s [axial tilt](axial%20tilt.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-19,139,250!2025-03-03,170,310-->

## name

This line of [latitude](latitude.md) was named {@{after the [constellation](constellation.md) [Capricornus](Capricornus.md) during last centuries [BCE](Common%20Era..md), as the [Sun](Sun.md) was there on the [December solstice](December%20solstice.md)}@}. Due to {@{westward [precession of the equinoxes](axial%20precession.md)}@}, this is no longer the case. The current constellation is {@{[Sagittarius](Sagittarius%20(constellation).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-20,316,290!2025-06-30,230,270!2025-06-09,216,270-->
