# star formation

__Star formation__ is {@{the process by which dense regions within [molecular clouds](molecular%20cloud.md) in [interstellar space](outer%20space.md#interstellar%20space), sometimes referred to as "stellar nurseries" or "[star](star.md)-forming regions", [collapse](Jeans%20instability.md) and form [stars](star.md)}@}.

## stellar nurseries

### cloud collapse

An interstellar cloud of gas will {@{remain in [hydrostatic equilibrium](hydrostatic%20equilibrium.md) as long as the [kinetic energy](kinetic%20energy.md) of the gas [pressure](pressure.md) is in balance with the [potential energy](potential%20energy.md) of the internal [gravitational force](gravity.md)}@}. Mathematically this is expressed {@{using the [virial theorem](virial%20theorem.md), which states that, to maintain equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy must equal twice the internal thermal energy}@}. If a cloud is {@{massive enough that the gas pressure is insufficient to support it}@}, the cloud will undergo [gravitational collapse](gravitational%20collapse.md). The mass above which a cloud will undergo such collapse is called {@{the [Jeans mass](Jeans%20instability.md#Jeans%20mass). The Jeans mass depends on the temperature and density of the cloud, but is typically thousands to tens of thousands of solar masses}@}. During {@{cloud collapse}@} {@{dozens to tens of thousands of stars form more or less simultaneously}@} which is observable in so-called {@{[embedded clusters](embedded%20cluster.md)}@}. The end product of a core collapse is {@{an [open cluster](open%20cluster.md) of stars}@}.

## protostar

- see: [protostar](protostar.md)

{@{Accretion of material onto the [protostar](protostar.md)}@} continues {@{partially from the newly formed [circumstellar disc](circumstellar%20disc.md)}@}. When {@{the density and temperature are high enough}@}, {@{[deuterium fusion](deuterium%20fusion.md) begins}@}, and {@{the outward [pressure](radiation%20pressure.md) of the resultant radiation}@} {@{slows \(but does not stop\) the collapse}@}. {@{Material comprising the cloud}@} continues to {@{"rain" onto the [protostar](protostar.md)}@}. In this stage {@{bipolar jets are produced called [Herbig–Haro objects](Herbig–Haro%20object.md)}@}. This is probably the means {@{by which excess [angular momentum](angular%20momentum.md) of the infalling material is expelled}@}, allowing {@{the star to continue to form}@}.
