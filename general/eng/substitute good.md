# substitute good

In [microeconomics](microeconomics.md), __substitute goods__ are {@{two goods that can be used for the same purpose by consumers}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> That is, {@{a [consumer](consumer.md) perceives both goods as similar or comparable}@}, so that {@{having more of one good causes the consumer to desire less of the other good}@}. Contrary to {@{[complementary goods](complementary%20good.md) and [independent goods](independent%20goods.md)}@}, substitute goods may {@{replace each other in use due to changing economic conditions}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> An example of substitute goods is {@{[Coca-Cola](Coca-Cola.md) and [Pepsi](Pepsi.md)}@}; the interchangeable aspect of these goods is due to {@{the similarity of the purpose they serve, i.e. fulfilling customers' desire for a soft drink}@}. These types of substitutes can be referred to as {@{close substitutes}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-06,353,350!2025-11-20,286,330!2025-10-20,261,330!2025-10-14,256,330!2026-02-04,351,350!2025-11-29,294,330!2025-11-22,288,330!2025-10-17,259,330-->

Substitute goods are {@{commodity which the consumer demanded to be used in place of another good}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-21,287,330-->

Economic theory describes {@{two goods as being close substitutes if three conditions hold}@}:<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-24,290,330-->

1. products have the same or similar performance ::@:: characteristics <!--SR:!2028-08-25,1073,350!2025-11-02,272,330-->
2. products have the same or similar occasion ::@:: for use and <!--SR:!2025-10-10,255,330!2025-11-15,282,330-->
3. products are sold in ::@:: the same geographic area <!--SR:!2025-09-22,239,330!2025-10-07,252,330-->

{@{Performance characteristics}@} describe {@{what the product does for the customer; a solution to customers' needs or wants}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> For example, a beverage would {@{quench a customer's thirst}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-27,244,330!2026-11-18,537,310!2025-10-30,268,330-->

{@{A product's occasion for use}@} describes {@{when, where and how it is used}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> For example, orange juice and soft drinks are {@{both beverages}@} but are {@{used by consumers in different occasions \(i.e. breakfast vs during the day\)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-26,266,330!2025-09-29,246,330!2028-02-18,897,330!2025-09-28,23,370-->

Two products are in {@{different geographic market if they are sold in different locations}@}, it is {@{costly to transport the goods or it is costly for consumers to travel to buy the goods}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-01-27,880,330!2025-10-27,267,330-->

Only if {@{the two products satisfy the three conditions}@}, will they be {@{classified as close substitutes according to economic theory}@}. The opposite of a substitute good is {@{a complementary good}@}, these are {@{goods that are dependent on another}@}. An example of complementary goods are {@{cereal and milk}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-29,267,330!2028-07-15,1039,350!2025-10-01,247,330!2025-10-09,252,330!2025-11-12,279,330-->

An example of substitute goods are {@{tea and coffee}@}. These two goods {@{satisfy the three conditions}@}: tea and coffee have {@{similar performance characteristics \(they quench a thirst\)}@}, they both have {@{similar occasions for use \(in the morning\)}@} and both are {@{usually sold in the same geographic area \(consumers can buy both at their local supermarket\)}@}. Some other common examples include {@{[margarine](margarine.md) and [butter](butter.md), and [McDonald's](McDonald's.md) and [Burger King](Burger%20King.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-31,269,330!2028-05-04,981,350!2025-09-23,241,330!2025-10-27,266,330!2027-04-01,593,310!2027-04-13,670,330-->

Formally, good $x_{j}$ is {@{a substitute for good $x_{i}$}@} if {@{when the [price](price.md) of $x_{i}$ rises the [demand](demand.md) for $x_{j}$ rises}@}, see figure 1. <!--SR:!2025-11-28,293,330!2025-10-18,259,330-->

Let {@{$p_{i}$ be the [price](price.md) of good $x_{i}$}@}. Then, {@{$x_{j}$ is a substitute for $x_{i}$}@} if: {@{${\frac {\partial x_{j} }{\partial p_{i} } }>0$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-14,281,330!2025-09-30,246,330!2026-01-29,346,350-->

## cross elasticity of demand

{@{The fact that one good is substitutable for another}@} has {@{immediate economic consequences}@}: insofar {@{as one good can be substituted for another}@}, {@{the [demands](demand.md) for the two goods will be interrelated}@} by the fact that {@{customers can trade off one good for the other if it becomes advantageous to do so}@}. {@{Cross-price elasticity}@} helps us understand {@{the degree of substitutability of the two products}@}. {@{An increase in the price of a good}@} will {@{increase demand for its substitutes}@}, while {@{a decrease in the price of a good will decrease demand for its substitutes}@}, see Figure 2.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-31,348,350!2025-11-04,273,330!2025-09-23,240,330!2025-10-25,264,330!2028-07-18,1042,350!2025-11-16,283,330!2025-09-21,239,330!2025-11-05,274,330!2027-10-23,820,330!2025-11-28,293,330-->

{@{The relationship between [demand schedules](demand%20curve.md)}@} determines {@{whether goods are classified as substitutes or complements}@}. {@{The [cross-price elasticity of demand](cross%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md)}@} shows {@{the relationship between two goods}@}, it captures {@{the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in price of another good}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-23,289,330!2025-09-27,244,330!2025-10-15,257,330!2028-08-21,1069,350!2025-09-29,246,330-->

{@{Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand \(_E_<sub>x,y</sub>\)}@} is calculated with the following formula: <p> {@{_E_<sub>x,y</sub> = Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded for Good X __/__ Percentage Change in Price of Good Y}@} <!--SR:!2025-11-17,284,330!2027-08-23,759,330-->

The cross-price elasticity may be {@{positive or negative, depending on whether the goods are complements or substitutes}@}. A substitute good is {@{a good with a positive cross elasticity of demand}@}. This means that, if {@{good $x_{j}$ is a substitute for good $x_{i}$}@}, {@{an increase in the price of $x_{i}$ will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of $x_{i}$}@} and {@{cause the demand curve for $x_{j}$ to [shift out](demand%20curve.md#changes%20that%20increase%20demand)}@}. {@{A decrease in the price of $x_{i}$ will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of $x_{i}$}@} and {@{cause the demand curve for $x_{j}$ to [shift in](demand%20curve.md#changes%20that%20decrease%20demand)}@}. Furthermore, perfect substitutes have {@{a higher cross elasticity of demand than imperfect substitutes do}@}. <!--SR:!2027-04-09,666,330!2027-05-04,688,330!2027-11-12,822,330!2025-10-10,253,330!2025-11-02,271,330!2028-07-30,1052,350!2025-10-03,249,330!2026-08-13,468,310-->

## types

### perfect and imperfect substitutes

#### perfect substitutes

>
> Figure 3: {@{Utility functions of perfect substitutes}@} <!--SR:!2025-09-18,236,330!2027-09-08,772,330-->

{@{Perfect substitutes}@} refer to {@{a pair of goods with uses identical to one another}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> In that case, {@{the [utility](utility.md) of a combination of the two goods}@} is {@{an increasing function of the sum of the quantity of each good}@}. That is, {@{the more the consumer can consume \(in total quantity\)}@}, {@{the higher level of utility will be achieved}@}, see figure 3. <!--SR:!2025-11-22,288,330!2026-02-04,351,350!2025-09-20,238,330!2026-08-12,469,310!2025-10-17,258,330!2025-11-06,275,330-->

Perfect substitutes have {@{a [linear utility](linear%20utility.md) function and a constant [marginal rate of substitution](marginal%20rate%20of%20substitution.md)}@}, see figure 3.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> If {@{goods X and Y are perfect substitutes}@}, {@{any different consumption bundle will result in the consumer obtaining the same utility level}@} for {@{all the points on the indifference curve \(utility function\)}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> Let {@{a consumption bundle be represented by \(X,Y\)}@}, then, a consumer of perfect substitutes would {@{receive the same level of utility from \(20,10\) or \(30,0\)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-28,293,330!2025-11-23,289,330!2026-10-04,504,310!2025-11-13,280,330!2025-09-29,246,330!2026-01-26,343,350-->

Consumers of perfect substitutes {@{base their rational decision-making process on prices only}@}. Evidently, the consumer will {@{choose the [cheapest](expense.md) bundle to maximise their profits}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> If {@{the prices of the goods differed}@}, there would be {@{no demand for the more expensive good}@}. {@{Producers and sellers of perfect substitute goods}@} directly {@{compete with each other, that is, they are known to be in direct [price competition](price%20war.md)}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-04,273,330!2025-10-30,268,330!2025-11-11,278,330!2025-11-27,292,330!2025-10-02,248,330!2025-10-04,250,330-->

An example of perfect substitutes is {@{butter from two different producers}@}; the producer may be {@{different but their purpose and usage are the same}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-24,290,330!2028-08-04,1056,350-->

Perfect substitutes have {@{a high cross-elasticity of demand}@}. For example, if {@{[Country Crock](Country%20Crock.md) and Imperial margarine have the same price listed for the same amount of spread}@}, but {@{one brand increases its price}@}, its sales will {@{fall by a certain amount. In response, the other brand's sales will increase by the same amount}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-28,293,330!2026-11-14,533,310!2026-01-28,345,350!2026-01-27,344,350-->

#### imperfect substitutes

{@{Imperfect substitutes, also known as close substitutes}@}, have {@{a lesser level of substitutability}@}, and therefore {@{exhibit variable marginal rates of substitution along the consumer [indifference curve](indifference%20curve.md)}@}. The consumption points on the curve offer {@{the same level of utility as before}@}, but {@{compensation depends on the starting point of the substitution}@}. Unlike perfect substitutes \(see figure 4\), {@{the indifference curves of imperfect substitutes}@} are {@{not linear and the marginal rate of substitution is different for different set of combinations on the curve}@}.<!-- <sup>\[_[citation needed](Wikipedia:Citation%20needed.md)_\]</sup> --> Close substitute goods are {@{similar products that target the same customer groups and satisfy the same needs}@}, but {@{have slight differences in characteristics}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> {@{Sellers of close substitute goods}@} are therefore in {@{indirect competition with each other}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-24,290,330!2025-10-17,259,330!2026-06-21,428,310!2025-10-22,263,330!2027-09-25,785,330!2025-11-11,278,330!2026-08-08,463,310!2025-10-28,266,330!2027-09-15,775,330!2025-10-31,269,330!2028-07-12,1037,350-->

Beverages are {@{a great example of imperfect substitutes}@}. As {@{the price of Coca-Cola rises}@}, consumers could be expected to {@{substitute to Pepsi}@}. However, {@{many consumers prefer one brand over the other}@}. {@{Consumers who prefer one brand over the other}@} will not {@{trade between them one-to-one}@}. Rather, a consumer who {@{prefers Coca-Cola \(for example\) will be willing to exchange more Pepsi for less Coca-Cola}@}, in other words, consumers who {@{prefer Coca-Cola would be willing to pay more}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-28,268,330!2028-07-13,1038,350!2025-11-27,292,330!2025-10-22,246,330!2025-11-03,272,330!2025-10-25,265,330!2025-09-28,245,330!2027-04-10,669,330-->

{@{The degree to which a good has a perfect substitute}@} depends on {@{how specifically the good is defined}@}. {@{The broader the definition of a good}@}, {@{the easier it is for the good to have a substitute good}@}. On the other hand, {@{a good narrowly defined will be likely to not have a substitute good}@}. For example, {@{different types of cereal generally are substitutes for each other}@}, but [Rice Krispies](Rice%20Krispies.md) cereal, which is {@{a very narrowly defined good as compared to cereal generally, has few, if any substitutes}@}. To illustrate this further, we can imagine that while both Rice Krispies and [Froot Loops](Froot%20Loops.md) are {@{types of cereal, they are imperfect substitutes, as the two are very different types of cereal}@}. However, {@{generic brands of Rice Krispies}@}, such as [Malt-o-Meal's](MOM%20Brands.md) Crispy Rice would be {@{a perfect substitute for Kellogg's Rice Krispies}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-10,277,330!2025-10-09,254,330!2025-10-02,248,330!2025-11-01,270,330!2026-07-06,441,310!2027-04-05,664,330!2028-02-23,901,330!2027-04-02,594,310!2027-07-18,732,330!2027-03-28,661,330-->

Imperfect substitutes have {@{a low cross-elasticity of demand}@}. If {@{two brands of cereal have the same prices before one's price is raised}@}, we can expect {@{sales to fall for that brand}@}. However, {@{sales will not raise by the same amount for the other brand}@}, as {@{there are many types of cereal that are equally substitutable for the brand which has raised its price}@}; {@{consumer preferences}@} determine {@{which brands pick up their losses}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-28,345,350!2026-10-31,525,310!2025-09-28,244,330!2025-10-29,268,330!2027-10-07,808,330!2028-08-16,1066,350!2025-11-09,276,330-->

### gross and net substitutes

If {@{two goods are imperfect substitutes}@}, economists can {@{distinguish them as gross substitutes or net substitutes}@}. Good $x_{j}$ is {@{a __gross substitute__ for good $x_{i}$ if, when the price of good $x_{i}$ increases, spending on good $x_{j}$ increases}@}, as described above. Gross substitutability is {@{not a symmetric relationship}@}. Even if {@{$x_{j}$ is a gross substitute for $x_{i}$, it may not be true that $x_{i}$ is a gross substitute for $x_{j}$}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-26,240,330!2025-10-16,258,330!2026-01-30,347,350!2025-10-16,258,330!2025-11-19,285,330-->

Two goods are {@{__net substitutes__ when the demand for good X increases when the price of good Y increases and the utility derived from the substitute remains constant}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-11,254,330-->

{@{Goods $x_{i}$ and $x_{j}$ are said to be net substitutes}@} if {@{$$\left.{\frac {\partial x_{j} }{\partial p_{i} } }\right|_{u=const}>0$$}@} That is, goods are {@{net substitutes if they are substitutes for each other under a constant utility function}@}. Net substitutability has {@{the desirable property that, unlike gross substitutability, it is symmetric}@}: {@{$$\left.{\frac {\partial x_{j} }{\partial p_{i} } }\right|_{u=const}=\left.{\frac {\partial x_{i} }{\partial p_{j} } }\right|_{u=const}$$}@} That is, if {@{good $x_{j}$ is a net substitute for good $x_{i}$, then good $x_{i}$ is also a net substitute for good $x_{j}$}@}. {@{The symmetry of net substitution}@} is {@{both intuitively appealing and theoretically useful}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-16,257,330!2026-07-05,441,310!2026-09-24,498,310!2025-09-18,237,330!2026-02-05,352,350!2025-10-03,249,330!2025-09-28,245,330!2028-07-03,1029,350-->

The common misconception is that {@{[competitive equilibrium](competitive%20equilibrium.md) is non-existent when it comes to products that are net substitutes}@}. Like {@{most times when products are gross substitutes}@}, they will {@{also likely be net substitutes}@}, hence {@{most gross substitute preferences supporting a competitive equilibrium also serve as examples of net substitutes doing the same}@}. This misconception can be further clarified by {@{looking at the nature of net substitutes which exists}@} in {@{a purely hypothetical situation where a fictitious entity}@} {@{interferes to shut down the [income effect](consumer%20choice.md#income%20effect) and maintain a constant utility function}@}. This {@{defeats the point of a competitive equilibrium}@}, where {@{no such intervention takes place}@}. The equilibrium is {@{decentralized}@} and left to {@{the producers and consumers to determine and arrive at an equilibrium price}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-23,289,330!2025-10-28,267,330!2026-01-31,348,350!2028-02-26,903,330!2028-08-07,1056,350!2027-06-01,639,310!2026-02-02,349,350!2025-11-07,276,330!2027-03-19,653,330!2025-09-18,13,350!2025-10-04,24,370-->

### within-category and cross-category substitutes

{@{__Within-category substitutes__}@} are {@{goods that are members of the same taxonomic category}@} such as {@{goods sharing common attributes}@} \(e.g., chocolate, chairs, station wagons\). <!--SR:!2025-11-14,281,330!2025-11-27,292,330!2026-01-31,348,350-->

{@{__Cross-category substitutes__}@} are {@{goods that are members of different taxonomic categories but can satisfy the same goal}@}. {@{A person who wants chocolate but cannot acquire it}@}, for example, might {@{instead buy ice cream to satisfy the goal of having a dessert}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-26,265,330!2027-11-14,823,330!2025-11-27,292,330!2028-08-20,1069,350-->

{@{Whether goods are cross-category or within-category substitutes}@} influences {@{the utility derived by consumers}@}. In the case of food, people exhibit {@{a strong preference for within-category substitutes over cross-category substitutes}@}, despite {@{cross-category substitutes being more effective at satisfying customers' needs}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> Across ten sets of different foods, 79.7% of research participants believed that {@{a within-category substitute would better satisfy their craving for a food they could not have than a cross-category substitute}@}. Unable to {@{acquire a desired Godiva chocolate}@}, for instance, a majority reported that they would prefer to {@{eat a store-brand chocolate \(a within-category substitute\) than a chocolate-chip [granola bar](granola.md#granola%20bar) \(a cross-category substitute\)}@}. {@{This preference for within-category food}@} substitutes appears, however, {@{to be misguided}@}. Because {@{within-category food substitutes are more similar to the missing food}@}, {@{their inferiority to it is more noticeable}@}. This creates {@{a negative [contrast effect](contrast%20effect.md)}@}, and leads {@{within-category substitutes to be less satisfying substitutes than cross-category substitutes unless the quality is comparable}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-20,286,330!2025-11-21,287,330!2025-10-10,255,330!2025-11-21,287,330!2025-11-07,276,330!2025-11-01,270,330!2025-11-13,280,330!2025-11-10,277,330!2025-11-02,271,330!2025-10-21,262,330!2025-10-12,255,330!2025-10-07,252,330!2027-08-02,710,330-->

### unit-demand goods

{@{[Unit-demand goods](unit%20demand.md)}@} are {@{categories of goods from which consumer wants only a single item}@}. If {@{the consumer has two unit-demand items}@}, then {@{his utility is the _maximum_ of the utilities he gains from each of these items}@}. For example, consider {@{a consumer that wants a means of transportation, which may be either a car or a bicycle}@}. The consumer {@{prefers a car to a bicycle}@}.

## in perfect and monopolistic market structures

### perfect competition

{@{Perfect competition}@} is solely based on {@{firms having equal conditions and the continuous pursuit of these conditions, regardless of the market size}@}.<sup>[\[17\]](#^ref-17)</sup> {@{One of the requirements for [perfect competition](perfect%20competition.md)}@} is that {@{the goods of competing firms should be perfect substitutes}@}. {@{Products sold by different firms}@} have {@{minimal differences in capabilities, features, and pricing}@}. Thus, {@{buyers cannot distinguish between products based on physical attributes or intangible value}@}.<sup>[\[18\]](#^ref-18)</sup> When {@{this condition is not satisfied}@}, the market is characterized by {@{[product differentiation](product%20differentiation.md)}@}. A perfectly competitive market is {@{a theoretical benchmark and does not exist in reality}@}. However, perfect substitutability is {@{significant in the era of [deregulation](deregulation.md)}@} because {@{there are usually several competing providers \(e.g., electricity suppliers\) selling the same good}@} which result in {@{aggressive [price competition](price%20war.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-28,293,330!2028-01-10,866,330!2025-10-06,251,330!2025-09-29,245,330!2028-07-28,1051,350!2026-02-03,350,350!2025-11-29,294,330!2028-08-10,1060,350!2025-09-20,238,330!2025-10-18,258,330!2025-09-19,237,330!2028-07-28,1050,350!2026-08-09,464,310-->

### monopolistic competition

{@{[Monopolistic competition](monopolistic%20competition.md)}@} characterizes {@{an industry in which many firms offer products or services that are close, but not perfect substitutes}@}. Monopolistic firms have {@{little power to set curtail supply or raise prices to increase [profits](profit%20(economics).md)}@}.<sup>[\[19\]](#^ref-19)</sup> Thus, the firms will try to {@{differentiate their product through branding and marketing to capture above market returns}@}. Some common examples of monopolistic industries include {@{gasoline, milk, Internet connectivity \(ISP services\), electricity, telephony, and airline tickets}@}. Since {@{firms offer similar products}@}, demand is {@{highly elastic in monopolistic competition}@}.<sup>[\[20\]](#^ref-20)</sup> As a result of {@{demand being very responsive to price changes}@}, consumers will {@{switch to the cheapest alternative as a result of price increases}@}. This is known as {@{switching costs, or essentially what the consumers are willing to give up}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-22,288,330!2025-10-19,260,330!2025-11-23,289,330!2027-06-05,642,310!2026-07-19,450,310!2026-02-02,349,350!2026-10-26,520,310!2027-08-06,746,330!2026-02-24,335,290!2027-05-11,678,330-->

## market effects

{@{The Michael Porter invented "Porter's Five Forces"}@} to {@{analyse an industry's attractiveness and likely [profitability](profit%20(economics).md)}@}. Alongside {@{competitive rivalry, buyer power, supplier power and threat of new entry}@}, Porter identifies {@{the threat of substitution as one of the five important industry forces}@}. {@{The threat of substitution}@} refers to {@{the likelihood of customers finding alternative products to purchase}@}. When {@{close substitutes are available}@}, customers can {@{easily and quickly forgo buying a company's product by finding other alternatives}@}. This can {@{weaken a company's power which threatens long-term profitability}@}. The risk of substitution can be considered high when:<sup>[\[21\]](#^ref-21)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-10-22,262,330!2025-10-19,259,330!2025-12-12,280,290!2026-01-29,346,350!2026-01-30,347,350!2026-07-04,399,290!2025-10-15,257,330!2028-08-17,1066,350!2028-07-04,1030,350-->

- Customers have slight ::@:: switching costs between two available substitutes. <!--SR:!2025-11-29,294,330!2025-11-03,272,330-->
- The quality and performance offered by a close substitute are ::@:: of a higher standard. <!--SR:!2025-10-12,255,330!2025-11-29,294,330-->
- Customers of a product have ::@:: low loyalty towards the brand or product, hence being more sensitive to price changes. <!--SR:!2026-02-05,352,350!2027-06-14,703,330-->

Additionally substitute goods have {@{a large impact on markets, consumer and sellers}@} through the following factors: <!--SR:!2025-11-27,292,330-->

1. Markets characterised by close/perfect substitute goods experience {@{great [volatility](volatility%20(finance).md) in prices}@}.<sup>[\[22\]](#^ref-22)</sup> This volatility {@{negatively impacts producers' profits, as it is possible to earn higher profits in markets with fewer substitute products}@}. That is, perfect substitute results in {@{profits being driven down to zero as seen in perfectly competitive markets equilibrium}@}.
2. As a result of {@{the intense competition caused the availability of substitute goods}@}, {@{low quality products can arise}@}. Since {@{prices are reduced to capture a larger share of the market}@}, firms try to {@{reduce their utilisation of resources which in turn will reduce their costs}@}.<sup>[\[22\]](#^ref-22)</sup>
3. In a market with close/perfect substitutes, customers have {@{a wide range of products to choose from}@}. As {@{the number of substitutes increase, the probability that every consumer selects what is right for them also increases}@}.<sup>[\[22\]](#^ref-22)</sup> That is, consumers can {@{reach a higher overall utility level from the availability of substitute products}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-29,294,330!2027-09-12,783,330!2026-08-16,471,310!2025-10-08,253,330!2025-11-18,285,330!2027-08-11,751,330!2027-06-27,727,330!2025-11-20,286,330!2025-10-08,253,330!2026-02-02,349,350-->
