# starburst galaxy

A __starburst galaxy__ is {@{one undergoing an exceptionally high rate of [star formation](star%20formation.md), as compared to the long-term average rate of star formation in the [galaxy](galaxy.md), or the star formation rate observed in most other galaxies}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-22,212,330-->

For example, the star formation rate of the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md) galaxy is {@{approximately 3 [M<sub>☉</sub>](solar%20mass.md)/yr}@}, while {@{starburst galaxies can experience star formation rates of 100 M<sub>☉</sub>/yr or more}@}. In a starburst galaxy, {@{the rate of star formation is so large that the galaxy consumes all of its gas reservoir, from which the stars are forming, on a timescale much shorter than the age of the galaxy}@}. As such, {@{the [starburst](starburst%20region.md) nature of a galaxy is a phase}@}, and one that {@{typically occupies a brief period of a [galaxy's evolution](galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md)}@}. The majority of starburst galaxies are {@{in the midst of a [merger](galaxy%20merger.md) or [close encounter](interacting%20galaxy.md) with another galaxy}@}. Starburst galaxies include {@{[M82](messier%2082.md), [NGC 4038/NGC 4039](Antennae%20Galaxies.md) (the Antennae Galaxies), and [IC 10](IC%2010.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-03,246,330!2025-08-28,288,330!2025-08-18,279,330!2025-07-21,259,330!2025-08-11,275,330!2025-06-18,232,330!2025-03-17,113,210-->
