# air separation

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../../tools/utility.py.md
```

__Air separation__ {@{separates [atmospheric air](atmosphere%20of%20Earth.md) into its components}@}. It is carried out in {@{air separation plants}@}.

The most common method is [cryogenic distillation](#cryogenic%20distillation).

## cryogenic distillation

- see: ::@:: [fractional distillation](fractional%20distillation.md)

{@{Pure gases}@} are separated by {@{cooling air until it [liquefies](liquefaction.md)}@}. Then {@{[distill](distillation.md) the components at their boiling points}@}.

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects('28370e', '293842'),
  (
    'Filter air to remove [dust](dust.md).',
    'Compress air. Most [water](water.md) is condensed out in [inter-stage coolers](intercooler.md). [Temperature](temperature.md) decreases to about 193 K.',
    'Pass air through a [molecular sieve](molecular%20sieve.md) bed to remove now-solid water vapor and [carbon dioxide](carbon%20dioxide.md).',
    'Air is cooled with [heat exchangers](heat%20exchanger.md) and [expanders](expander.md), becoming liquid. Temperature decreases to about 73 K.',
    'Liquid air is passed into [fractionating columns](fractionating%20column.md). Nitrogen, argon, and oxygen respectively boils at 77.4 K, 87.3 K, and 90.2 K. Gases that have lower [boiling points](boiling%20point.md) are collected at the top.',
    'Products are warmed against incoming air to ambient temperatures.',
  ),
)
