# lower of cost or market

In {@{[accounting](accounting.md)}@}, {@{__lower of cost or market__ \(__LCM__ or __LOCOM__\)}@} is {@{a [conservative](convention%20of%20conservatism.md) approach to [valuing](valuation%20(finance).md) and reporting [inventory](inventory.md)}@}. Normally, {@{[ending inventory](ending%20inventory.md) is stated at [historical cost](historical%20cost.md)}@}. However, there are times when {@{the original cost of the ending inventory is greater than the [net realizable value](net%20realizable%20value.md)}@}, and thus {@{the inventory has lost value}@}. If {@{the inventory has decreased in value below historical cost}@}, then {@{its carrying value is reduced and reported on the [balance sheet](balance%20sheet.md)}@}. The criterion for reporting this is {@{the current [market value](market%20value.md)}@}. {@{Any loss resulting from the decline in the value of inventory}@} is {@{charged to "[cost of goods sold](cost%20of%20goods%20sold.md)" \(COGS\) if non-material, or "loss on the reduction of inventory to LCM" if material}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-02,298,332!2026-03-21,338,345!2025-11-23,242,332!2026-03-26,342,345!2026-03-26,342,345!2026-02-04,300,332!2026-03-22,339,345!2025-11-30,248,332!2026-01-10,280,332!2028-02-18,864,332!2026-06-09,371,305-->

## history

The lower of cost or market concept first {@{became part of normal accounting practices in England during the nineteenth century}@}. Lower of cost or market was considered {@{fair because assets were valued on a going-concern basis, rather than the price at which the assets were purchased}@}. During the nineteenth century, lower of cost or market was not {@{common practice for valuation of factory inventory in the United States}@}. The concept was not {@{easy for the Academic Accountants to accept due to its lack of logic}@}. Despite {@{the criticism}@}, lower of cost or market {@{quickly caught on in practice and by the early twentieth century was described as the most commonly accepted method for inventory valuation}@} according to {@{the Report of the Special Committee on Co-operation with Stock Exchanges}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> Although {@{it lacked accounting logic}@}, lower of cost or market {@{survived because of its conservative approach to valuation}@} and because {@{it addressed opposing principles of cost and value}@}. Its conservatism allowed users to {@{value the inventory at the price for which the inventory could be sold}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-01,297,332!2026-10-07,422,292!2026-03-20,337,345!2026-03-19,336,345!2025-11-23,242,332!2026-01-02,260,292!2027-03-13,569,292!2026-03-20,337,345!2028-01-15,840,332!2026-03-27,343,345!2027-06-13,670,332-->

## challenges

Three possible values {@{can represent the market value}@}: {@{the replacement cost of the inventory, the net realizable value \(also known as the "ceiling"\), and the "floor" \(the difference between the net realizable value and the normal profit (annotation: i.e. cost at time of purchase)\)}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> In the lower of cost or market approach, companies must {@{determine these three values and find the median of the values}@}. (annotation: This could be interpreted as {@{the "ceiling" and the "floor" clamping the replacement cost to get the designated market value}@}.) The companies then {@{compare the median value, which is called the designated market value, to the inventory cost that is recorded}@}. {@{The lower of these two values}@} is {@{subsequently reported on the balance sheet}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> Because {@{the lower of cost or market approach requires companies to use three possible market values}@}, {@{the companies' financial statements can be difficult to compare}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-24,340,345!2026-09-11,379,265!2026-02-04,300,332!2028-04-22,900,332!2026-08-04,389,305!2026-01-08,278,332!2026-03-26,342,345!2026-01-07,277,332!2026-02-03,299,332-->

## contemporary usage

{@{The term "lower of cost or market"}@} is {@{now obsolete and is officially replaced by "lower of cost and net realizable value"}@}. According to {@{the FASB Accounting Standards Update}@}, <!--SR:!2026-02-04,300,332!2026-03-22,339,345!2026-03-27,343,345-->

> An entity should {@{measure inventory}@} within the scope of this Update {@{at the lower of cost and net realizable value}@}. {@{Net realizable value}@} is {@{the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business}@}, less {@{reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-23,339,345!2026-01-09,277,330!2026-01-09,279,332!2027-05-10,563,285!2026-02-12,90,381-->

This FASB update makes usage {@{consistent with the IFRS wording and removes the use of "or" in a context where "and" was always the correct one}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> However, {@{the update does not apply to all companies}@}. {@{Companies that use the FIFO \(first-in, first-out\) and average-cost methods of inventory valuation}@} are {@{required to implement the changes}@}, whereas {@{companies that use the LIFO \(last-in, first-out\) and retail inventory methods are not affected by the update}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-03-27,343,345!2026-02-04,300,332!2027-11-01,753,305!2026-05-03,337,292!2026-03-21,338,345-->
