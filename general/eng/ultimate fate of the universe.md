# ultimate fate of the universe

The __ultimate fate of the universe__ is {@{a topic in [physical cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md)}@}, whose {@{theoretical restrictions allow possible scenarios for the [evolution](chronology%20of%20the%20universe.md) and ultimate fate of the [universe](universe.md) to be described and evaluated}@}. Based on {@{available observational evidence}@}, deciding the fate and evolution of the universe has {@{become a valid cosmological question, being beyond the mostly [untestable](falsifiability.md) constraints of [mythological or theological beliefs](eschatology.md)}@}. {@{Several possible futures}@} have been predicted by {@{different scientific hypotheses}@}, including that {@{the universe might have existed for a finite and [infinite duration](static%20universe.md), or towards explaining the manner and circumstances of its beginning}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-17,232,330!2025-02-08,129,290!2025-06-29,243,330!2025-01-05,102,290!2025-07-16,256,330!2025-04-02,169,310!2025-01-12,105,290-->
