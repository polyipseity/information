# ultimate fate of the universe

The __ultimate fate of the universe__ is {@{a topic in [physical cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md)}@}, whose {@{theoretical restrictions allow possible scenarios for the [evolution](chronology%20of%20the%20universe.md) and ultimate fate of the [universe](universe.md) to be described and evaluated}@}. Based on {@{available observational evidence}@}, deciding the fate and evolution of the universe has {@{become a valid cosmological question, being beyond the mostly [untestable](falsifiability.md) constraints of [mythological or theological beliefs](eschatology.md)}@}. {@{Several possible futures}@} have been predicted by {@{different scientific hypotheses}@}, including that {@{the universe might have existed for a finite and [infinite duration](static%20universe.md), or towards explaining the manner and circumstances of its beginning}@}. <!--SR:!2028-05-08,1056,350!2026-07-13,520,310!2028-07-02,1099,350!2029-01-28,1189,310!2028-09-23,1165,350!2026-09-07,523,310!2025-11-15,307,290-->
