# photosphere

The __photosphere__ is {@{a [star](star.md)'s outer shell from which [light](light.md) is radiated}@}. It {@{extends into a star's surface until the [plasma](plasma%20(physics).md) becomes opaque, equivalent to an [optical depth](optical%20depth.md) of $-\ln(1 / 2) \approx 0.693$, or equivalently, a depth from which 50% of light will escape without being scattered}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-09,244,330!2025-06-01,200,270-->

The [absorption spectrum](absorption%20spectroscopy.md#absorption%20spectrum) of a [star](star.md) is {@{produced when light emitted by the star is absorbed by gases in the photosphere}@}. It tells us {@{about the composition of the photosphere and its [ionization state](ionization.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-25,374,290!2025-04-20,201,310-->
