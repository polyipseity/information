# dark energy

In [physical cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md) and [astronomy](astronomy.md), __dark energy__ is {@{an unknown form of [energy](energy.md) that affects the [universe](universe.md) on the largest scales}@}. Its primary effect is to drive the [accelerating expansion of the universe](accelerating%20expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md). Assuming that the [lambda-CDM model](Lambda-CDM%20model.md) of cosmology is correct, dark energy is the dominant component of the universe, contributing 68% of the total energy in the present-day [observable universe](observable%20universe.md) while [dark matter](dark%20matter.md) and [ordinary (baryonic)](baryon.md#baryonic%20matter) matter contribute 26% and 5%, respectively, and other components such as [neutrinos](neutrino.md) and [photons](photon.md) are nearly negligible. Dark energy's [density](density.md) is very low: 7×10<sup>−30</sup> g/cm<sup>3</sup> (6×10<sup>−10</sup> J/m<sup>3</sup> in [mass-energy](mass–energy%20equivalence.md)), much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies. However, it dominates the universe's mass–energy content because it is uniform across space. <!--SR:!2028-07-27,1121,350-->

## evidence of existence

The evidence for dark energy is {@{indirect but comes from three independent sources}@}: <!--SR:!2025-09-21,307,330-->

- distance and redshift ::@:: Distance measurements and their relation to [redshift](redshift.md), which suggest the universe has expanded more in the latter half of its life. <!--SR:!2026-06-03,479,310!2027-05-18,756,330-->
- curvature of the universe ::@:: The theoretical need for a type of additional energy that is not matter or dark matter to form the [observationally flat universe](shape%20of%20the%20universe.md#curvature%20of%20the%20universe) (absence of any detectable global curvature). <!--SR:!2028-07-23,1117,350!2026-03-09,385,290-->
- mass density ::@:: Measures of large-scale wave patterns of mass density in the universe. <!--SR:!2028-02-21,964,330!2025-09-08,295,330-->

### supernovae

In {@{1998, the [High-Z Supernova Search Team](High-Z%20Supernova%20Search%20Team.md)}@} published {@{observations of [Type Ia](Type%20Ia%20supernova.md) ("one-A") [supernovae](supernova.md)}@}. In {@{1999, the [Supernova Cosmology Project](Supernova%20Cosmology%20Project.md)}@} followed by {@{suggesting that the expansion of the universe is [accelerating](deceleration%20parameter.md)}@}. {@{The 2011 [Nobel Prize in Physics](list%20of%20Nobel%20laureates%20in%20Physics.md)}@} was awarded to {@{[Saul Perlmutter](Saul%20Perlmutter.md), [Brian P. Schmidt](Brian%20Schmidt.md), and [Adam G. Riess](Adam%20Riess.md) for their leadership in the discovery}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-15,352,290!2027-01-12,669,330!2028-05-29,1073,350!2026-04-12,409,290!2025-08-09,273,330!2026-07-25,495,310-->

### cosmic microwave background

The existence of dark energy, in whatever form, is {@{needed to reconcile the measured geometry of space with the total amount of matter in the universe}@}. {@{Measurements of [cosmic microwave background](cosmic%20microwave%20background.md) [anisotropies](anisotropy.md)}@} indicate that {@{the universe is close to [flat](flatness%20problem.md). For the [shape of the universe](shape%20of%20the%20universe.md) to be flat}@}, {@{the mass–energy density of the universe must be equal to the [critical density](friedmann%20equations.md#density%20parameter)}@}. {@{The total amount of matter in the universe (including [baryons](baryon.md) and [dark matter](dark%20matter.md))}@}, as measured from the cosmic microwave background spectrum, accounts for {@{only about 30% of the critical density}@}. This implies {@{the existence of an additional form of energy to account for the remaining 70%}@}. {@{The [Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe](Wilkinson%20Microwave%20Anisotropy%20Probe.md) (WMAP) spacecraft [seven-year analysis](Wilkinson%20Microwave%20Anisotropy%20Probe.md#seven-year%20data%20release)}@} estimated a universe made up of {@{72.8% dark energy, 22.7% dark matter, and 4.5% ordinary matter}@}. Work done in {@{2013 based on the [Planck spacecraft](planck%20(spacecraft).md) observations of the cosmic microwave background}@} gave a more accurate estimate of {@{68.3% dark energy, 26.8% dark matter, and 4.9% ordinary matter}@}. <!--SR:!2027-09-17,846,330!2027-09-01,832,330!2025-09-27,311,330!2025-10-21,286,290!2025-10-01,314,330!2027-06-17,789,330!2028-03-16,1016,350!2027-01-01,532,290!2026-12-21,518,230!2026-11-07,599,310!2027-06-20,709,270-->
