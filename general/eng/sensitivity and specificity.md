# sensitivity and specificity

## definition

### sensitivity

Sensitivity, is also called {@{recall, true positive rate, or detection rate in a clinical setting}@}. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: {@{$$\text{sensitivity} = \frac {\text{TP} } {\text{TP} + \text{FN} }$$}@}, where {@{TP are true positives and FN are false negatives (see [false positives and false negatives](false%20positives%20and%20false%20negatives.md))}@}. <!--SR:!2027-01-06,673,290!2029-02-01,1315,350!2027-05-10,810,330-->

### specificity

Specificity, is also called {@{selectivity or true negative rate}@}. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: {@{$$\text{specificity} = \frac {\text{TN} } {\text{TN} + \text{FP} }$$}@}, where {@{TN are true negatives and FP are false positives (see [false positives and false negatives](false%20positives%20and%20false%20negatives.md))}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-09,488,310!2029-02-27,1337,350!2026-01-23,437,310-->
