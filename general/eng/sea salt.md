[Filter](filtration.md) seawater with a folded [filter paper](filter%20paper.md) in a [filter funnel](filter%20funnel.md) to remove [insoluble](solubility.md) [substances](chemical%20substance.md).
[Evaporate](evaportaion.md) the filtered seawater to obtain a [powder](powder.md) of sea salts. Direct heating or a [steam bath](heated%20bath.md) can be used to speed up the process in a [evaporating dish](evaporating%20dish.md).
Alternatively, [crystalize](crystallization.md) the filtered seawater to obtain [crystals](crystal.md). Cooling hot saturated seawater or slow evaporation of seawater can be used.
(explanation) In both methods, [concentration](concentration.md) of seawater increases and becomes saturated. The latter produces larger crystals than the former.
