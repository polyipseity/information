# balance sheet

In [financial accounting](financial%20accounting.md), a __balance sheet__ (also known as {@{__statement of financial position__ or __statement of financial condition__}@}) is {@{a summary of the financial balances of an individual or organization}@}, whether it be {@{a [sole proprietorship](sole%20proprietorship.md), a [business partnership](partnership.md), a [corporation](corporation.md), [private limited company](private%20limited%20company.md) or other organization such as [government](government%20financial%20statements.md) or [not-for-profit entity](nonprofit%20organization.md)}@}. {@{[Assets](asset.md), [liabilities](liability%20(financial%20accounting).md) and [ownership equity](equity%20(finance).md)}@} are {@{listed as of a specific date, such as the end of its [financial year](fiscal%20year.md)}@}. A balance sheet is often described as {@{a "snapshot of a company's financial condition".<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> It is the summary of each and every financial statement of an [organization](organization.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-19,255,330!2025-08-16,241,290!2025-09-25,223,250!2025-08-09,248,330!2025-07-28,238,330!2025-09-09,257,327-->

Of {@{the four basic [financial statements](financial%20statement.md)}@}, the balance sheet is {@{the only statement which applies to a single point in time of a business's calendar year}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-09-23,284,330!2025-08-21,257,330-->

A standard company balance sheet has {@{two sides: assets on the left, and financing on the rightâ€“which itself has two parts; liabilities and ownership [equity](equity%20(finance).md)}@}. The main categories of assets are {@{usually listed first, and typically in order of [liquidity](market%20liquidity.md)}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> Assets are {@{followed by the liabilities}@}. The difference between the assets and the liabilities is {@{known as equity or the net assets or the [net worth](net%20worth.md) or [capital](financial%20capital.md) of the company}@}. According to {@{the [accounting equation](accounting%20equation.md)}@}, net worth {@{must equal assets minus liabilities}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-07-27,222,290!2025-07-10,224,330!2025-09-29,290,330!2025-07-09,223,330!2025-07-04,219,330!2025-07-14,226,330-->

Another way to look at the balance sheet equation is that {@{total assets equals liabilities plus owner's equity}@}. Looking at the equation in this way shows {@{how assets were financed: either by borrowing money (liability) or by using the owner's money (owner's or shareholders' equity)}@}. Balance sheets are usually presented with {@{assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections "balancing"}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-22,258,330!2025-06-23,205,310!2025-04-05,148,310-->

{@{A business operating entirely in cash}@} can measure its profits by {@{withdrawing the entire bank balance at the end of the period, plus any cash in hand}@}. However, many businesses are {@{not paid immediately; they build up inventories of goods and acquire buildings and equipment}@}. In other words: businesses have {@{[assets](asset.md) and so they cannot, even if they want to, immediately turn these into cash at the end of each period}@}. Often, these businesses {@{owe money to suppliers and to tax authorities}@}, and the proprietors {@{do not withdraw all their original capital and profits at the end of each period}@}. In other words, businesses also have {@{[liabilities](liability%20(financial%20accounting).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-14,209,310!2025-11-01,314,330!2025-07-07,221,330!2025-08-20,256,330!2025-10-08,295,330!2025-07-13,225,330!2025-08-17,255,330-->

## types

A balance sheet {@{summarizes an organization's or individual's assets, [equity](equity%20(finance).md) and [liabilities](liability%20(financial%20accounting).md) at a specific point in time}@}. {@{Two forms of balance sheet}@} exist. They are {@{the report form and account form}@}. Individuals and small businesses tend to {@{have simple balance sheets}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> Larger businesses tend to {@{have more complex balance sheets, and these are presented in the organization's [annual report](annual%20report.md)}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> Large businesses also {@{may prepare balance sheets for segments of their businesses}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> A balance sheet is {@{often presented alongside one for a different point in time (typically the previous year) for comparison}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup><sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-07-01,216,330!2025-07-18,230,330!2025-04-04,149,310!2025-03-24,125,290!2025-07-15,227,330!2025-07-13,208,310!2025-06-15,190,310-->

### personal

A personal balance sheet lists {@{current [assets](asset.md) such as cash in [checking accounts](transaction%20account.md) and [savings accounts](savings%20account.md)}@}, {@{long-term assets such as [common stock](common%20stock.md) and [real estate](real%20estate.md)}@}, {@{current liabilities such as [loan](loan.md) debt and [mortgage](mortgage.md) debt due, or overdue}@}, {@{long-term liabilities such as [mortgage](mortgage.md) and other loan debt}@}. {@{Securities and real estate values}@} are {@{listed at [market value](market%20value.md) rather than at [historical cost](historical%20cost.md) or [cost basis](cost%20basis.md)}@}. Personal [net worth](net%20worth.md) is {@{the difference between an individual's total assets and total liabilities}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-08-23,259,330!2025-12-14,311,290!2025-06-19,206,330!2025-04-06,149,310!2025-10-20,297,310!2025-06-04,192,310!2025-09-05,269,330-->

The net [assets](asset.md) shown by the balance sheet equals {@{the third part of the balance sheet, which is known as the [shareholders' equity](equity%20(finance).md)}@}. It comprises: {@{controlling interest and non-controlling interest}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-11,210,310!2025-03-17,135,310-->

1. issued capital and [reserves](reserve%20(accounting).md) attributable to equity holders of the [parent company](holding%20company.md#parent%20company) (controlling interest)
2. [non-controlling interest](minority%20interest.md) in equity

Formally, shareholders' equity is {@{part of the company's liabilities: they are funds "owing" to shareholders (after payment of all other liabilities)}@}; usually, however, {@{"liabilities" are used in the more restrictive sense of liabilities excluding shareholders' equity}@}. {@{The balance of assets and liabilities (including shareholders' equity)}@} is not a coincidence. Records of the values of each account in the balance sheet are maintained using {@{a system of accounting known as [double-entry bookkeeping](double-entry%20bookkeeping.md)}@}. In this sense, shareholders' equity by construction {@{must equal assets minus liabilities, and thus the shareholders' equity is considered to be a residual}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-31,241,330!2025-08-07,246,330!2025-07-30,240,330!2025-06-17,191,310!2025-06-21,208,330-->

Regarding {@{the items in the equity section}@}, the following disclosures are required: <!--SR:!2025-06-14,198,310-->

1. numbers of [shares](share%20(finance).md) authorized, issued and fully-paid, and issued but not fully paid
2. [par value](par%20value.md) of shares
3. reconciliation of shares outstanding at the beginning and the end of the period
4. description of rights, preferences, and restrictions of shares
5. [treasury shares](treasury%20stock.md), including shares held by [subsidiaries](subsidiary.md) and associates
6. shares reserved for issuance under [options](option%20(finance).md) and [contracts](contract.md)
7. a description of the nature and purpose of each reserve within owners' equity

## substantiation

__Balance sheet substantiation__ is {@{the [accounting](accounting.md) process conducted by [businesses](business.md) on a regular basis}@} to {@{confirm that the balances held in the primary accounting [system of record](system%20of%20record.md) (e.g. [SAP](SAP%20ERP.md), [Oracle](Oracle%20Database.md), other ERP system's General Ledger) are reconciled (in balance with) with the balance and transaction records held in the same or supporting sub-systems}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,125,290!2025-11-03,280,290-->

Balance sheet substantiation includes {@{multiple processes including [reconciliation](bank%20reconciliation.md) (at a transactional or at a balance level) of the account, a process of review of the reconciliation and any pertinent supporting documentation}@}, and {@{a formal [certification](certification.md) (sign-off) of the account in a predetermined form driven by corporate policy}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-24,222,250!2025-06-30,211,310-->

Balance sheet substantiation is {@{an important process that is typically carried out on a monthly, quarterly and year-end basis}@}. The results help to {@{drive the regulatory balance sheet reporting obligations of the organization}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-23,180,310!2025-03-25,141,310-->

Historically, balance sheet substantiation has been {@{a wholly manual process, driven by [spreadsheets](spreadsheet.md), [email](email.md) and manual monitoring and reporting}@}. In recent years {@{[software](software.md) solutions have been developed}@} to {@{bring a level of [process automation](business%20process%20automation.md), [standardization](standardization.md) and enhanced control to the balance sheet substantiation or account certification process}@}. These solutions are {@{suitable for organizations with a high volume of accounts and/or personnel involved in the balance sheet substantiation process}@} and can be used to {@{drive efficiencies, improve [transparency](transparency%20(behavior).md) and help to reduce risk}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-19,169,310!2025-08-30,265,330!2025-03-30,129,290!2025-06-18,208,310!2025-06-30,215,330-->

Balance sheet substantiation is {@{a key control process in the [SOX 404 top-down risk assessment](SOX%20404%20topâ€“down%20risk%20assessment.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-19,191,310-->

## sample

The following balance sheet is a very brief example prepared in accordance with [IFRS](International%20Financial%20Reporting%20Standards.md). It does not show all possible kinds of assets, liabilities and equity, but it shows the most usual ones. Because {@{it shows [goodwill](goodwill%20(accounting).md)}@}, it could be {@{a [consolidated](consolidated%20financial%20statement.md) balance sheet}@}. Monetary values are not shown, summary (subtotal) rows are missing as well. <!--SR:!2025-06-28,214,330!2025-05-03,166,310-->

{@{Under IFRS}@} items are {@{always shown based on liquidity from the least liquid assets at the top, usually land and buildings to the most liquid, i.e. cash}@}. Then liabilities and equity {@{continue from the most immediate liability to be paid (usual account payable) to the least i.e. long-term debt such as mortgages and owner's equity at the very bottom}@}.<sup>[\[20\]](#^ref-20)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-08-08,247,330!2025-03-19,139,310!2025-04-29,143,270-->
