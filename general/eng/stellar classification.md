# stellar classification

In the {@{Morganâ€“Keenan (MK) system}@}, [stars](star.md) are classified, {@{from the hottest to the coldest, _O_, _B_, _A_, _F_, _G_, _K_, and _M_ ([mnemonic](mnemonic.md): <u>O</u>h, <u>B</u>e <u>A</u> <u>F</u>ine <u>G</u>uy/<u>G</u>irl: <u>K</u>iss <u>M</u>e!), with each letter subvided by adding a numeric digit with _0_ being the hottest and _9_ being the coolest}@}. It has been expanded to include {@{other stars and star-like objects that do not fit in the classical system, like class _D_ for [white dwarfs](white%20dwarf.md) and classes _S_ and _C_ for [carbon stars](carbon%20star.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-16,1381,250!2029-03-15,1505,290!2029-09-20,1574,270-->

## modern classification

### Yerkes spectral classification

Denser stars with higher surface gravity exhibit {@{greater [pressure broadening](spectral%20line.md#pressure%20broadening) of [spectral lines](spectral%20line.md)}@}. The gravity, and hence the pressure, on the surface of a giant star is {@{much lower than for a dwarf star because the radius of the giant is much greater than a dwarf of similar [mass](mass.md)}@}. Therefore, differences in the spectrum can be interpreted as {@{luminosity effects and a luminosity class can be assigned purely from examination of the spectrum}@}. <!--SR:!2026-11-26,642,330!2025-10-02,285,290!2025-11-03,316,290-->

A number of different luminosity classes are distinguished, as listed in the table below. The [luminosity](luminosity.md) {@{generally decreases with increasing Roman numerals}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-09,266,330-->
