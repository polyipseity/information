# Milky Way

The __Milky Way__ is {@{the [galaxy](galaxy.md) that includes the [Solar System](Solar%20System.md)}@}, with the name {@{describing the galaxy's appearance from [Earth](Earth.md)}@}: {@{a hazy band of light seen in the [night sky](night%20sky.md)}@} formed from {@{stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the [naked eye](naked%20eye.md)}@}.

The Milky Way is {@{a [barred spiral galaxy](barred%20spiral%20galaxy.md)}@} with {@{a [D<sub>25</sub> isophotal diameter](galaxy.md#isophotal%20diameter) estimated at 26.8 ± 1.1 [kiloparsecs](parsec.md#parsecs%20and%20kiloparsecs) (87&nbsp;400 ± 3&nbsp;600 [light-years](light-year.md))}@}, but {@{only about 1&nbsp;000 light-years thick at the spiral arms (more at the bulge)}@}. Recent simulations suggest that {@{a [dark matter](dark%20matter.md) area, also containing some visible stars}@}, may extend up to {@{a diameter of almost 2 million light-years (613 kpc)}@}. The Milky Way has {@{several [satellite galaxies](Satellite%20galaxies%20of%20the%20Milky%20Way.md)}@} and is part of {@{the [Local Group](Local%20Group.md) of galaxies}@}, which form {@{part of the [Virgo Supercluster](Virgo%20Supercluster.md)}@}, which is itself {@{a component of the [Laniakea Supercluster](Laniakea%20Supercluster.md)}@}.

## intergalactic neighborhood

- see: [Local Group](Local%20Group.md)

Current measurements suggest the [Andromeda Galaxy](Andromeda%20Galaxy.md) is {@{approaching the Milky Way at 100 to 140 km/s (220&nbsp;000 to 310&nbsp;000 mph)}@}. In {@{4.3 billion years}@}, there {@{may be an [Andromeda–Milky Way collision](Andromeda–Milky%20Way%20collision.md), depending on the importance of unknown lateral components to the galaxies' relative motion}@}.
