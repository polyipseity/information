# Moon

The __Moon__ is {@{[Earth](Earth.md)'s only [natural satellite](natural%20satellite.md)}@}.  It [orbits](orbit%20of%20th%20Moon.md) at an [average distance](lunar%20distancee.md) of {@{384&nbsp;400 km (238&nbsp;900 mi), about 30 times the diameter of Earth}@}. [Tidal forces](tidal%20forces.md) {@{between Earth and the Moon have over time [synchronized](tidal%20locking.md) the Moon's orbital period ([lunar month](lunar%20month.md)) with its rotation period ([lunar day](lunar%20day.md)) at 29.5 Earth days}@}, causing {@{the [same side](near%20side%20of%20the%20Moon.md) of the Moon to always face Earth}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-29,252,330!2025-06-11,207,252!2025-08-05,301,332!2025-07-07,280,332-->

## Earth–Moon system

### orbit

The [Moon](Moon.md) makes a complete orbit around [Earth](Earth.md) with respect to the [fixed stars](fixed%20star.md), {@{its [sidereal period](orbital%20period.md), about once every 27.3 days}@}. However, because {@{the Earth-Moon system, meanwhile, moves in the same direction in its orbit around the [Sun](Sun.md)}@}, it {@{takes slightly longer, 29.5 days to return at the same [lunar phase](lunar%20phase.md), completing a full cycle, as seen from [Earth](Earth.md)}@}. This {@{[synodic period](orbital%20period.md#synodic%20period) or synodic month}@} is commonly known as {@{the [lunar month](lunar%20month.md) and is equal to the length of the [solar day](synodic%20day.md) on the Moon}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-04,498,312!2025-10-23,323,292!2025-03-09,174,312!2025-04-24,205,312!2026-02-08,388,292-->

Due to {@{[tidal locking](tidal%20locking.md)}@}, the [Moon](Moon.md) has {@{a 1:1 [spin–orbit resonance](orbital%20resonance.md). This [rotation](rotation.md)–[orbit](orbit.md) ratio makes the Moon's (sidereal, synodic, etc.) orbital periods around Earth equal to its corresponding (sidereal, synodic, etc.) [rotation periods](rotation%20period%20(astronomy).md)}@}. This is the reason for {@{only one side of the Moon, its so-called [near side](near%20side%20of%20the%20Moon.md), being visible from Earth}@}. That said, while {@{the movement of the Moon is in resonance, it still is not without nuances such as [libration](libration.md)}@}, resulting in {@{slightly changing perspectives, making over time and location on Earth about 59% of the Moon's surface visible from Earth}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-22,271,332!2025-04-10,206,312!2025-03-13,184,312!2025-02-06,163,312!2025-03-12,186,312-->
