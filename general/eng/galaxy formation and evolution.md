# galaxy formation and evolution

## commonly observed properties of galaxies

Because of {@{the inability to conduct experiments in outer space}@}, {@{the only way to "test" theories and models of galaxy evolution is to compare them with observations}@}. Explanations for how galaxies formed and evolved must be {@{able to predict the observed properties and types of galaxies}@}. <!--SR:!2027-01-29,682,330!2028-06-12,1083,350!2029-03-24,1305,350-->

[Edwin Hubble](Edwin%20Hubble.md) {@{created an early galaxy classification scheme, now known as the Hubble tuning-fork diagram}@}. It {@{partitioned galaxies into [ellipticals](elliptical%20galaxy.md), normal [spirals](spiral%20galaxy.md), [barred spirals](barred%20spiral%20galaxy.md) (such as the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md)), and [irregulars](irregular%20galaxy.md)}@}. These galaxy types {@{exhibit the following properties which can be explained by current galaxy evolution theories}@}: <!--SR:!2026-01-16,353,290!2025-12-07,321,290!2029-02-14,1277,350-->

- {@{Many of the properties of galaxies (including the [galaxy color–magnitude diagram](galaxy%20color–magnitude%20diagram.md))}@} indicate that {@{there are fundamentally two types of galaxies}@}. These groups divide into {@{blue star-forming galaxies that are more like spiral types}@}, and {@{red non-star forming galaxies that are more like elliptical galaxies}@}.
- Spiral galaxies are {@{quite thin, dense, and rotate relatively fast}@}, while {@{the stars in elliptical galaxies have randomly oriented orbits}@}.
- The majority of giant galaxies contain {@{a [supermassive black hole](supermassive%20black%20hole.md) in their centers, ranging in mass from millions to billions of times the mass of the [Sun](Sun.md)}@}. The black hole mass is {@{tied to the host galaxy bulge or spheroid mass}@}.
- {@{[Metallicity](metallicity.md)}@} has {@{a positive correlation with the luminosity (negative correlation with the [absolute magnitude](absolute%20magnitude.md)) of a galaxy}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-21,822,330!2027-11-17,909,330!2027-06-18,654,270!2025-09-04,261,290!2026-06-25,505,310!2026-02-27,380,270!2028-10-04,1173,350!2028-03-18,1016,350!2026-11-21,626,330!2027-12-16,914,330-->

Astronomers now believe that {@{disk galaxies likely formed first}@}, then {@{evolved into elliptical galaxies through galaxy mergers}@}. <!--SR:!2028-06-06,1080,350!2026-03-27,435,310-->

Current models also predict that {@{the majority of mass in galaxies is made up of [dark matter](dark%20matter.md), a substance which is not directly observable, and might not interact through any means except gravity}@}. This observation arises because {@{galaxies could not have formed as they have, or rotate as they are seen to, unless they contain far more mass than can be directly observed}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-02,330,290!2025-10-02,276,290-->
