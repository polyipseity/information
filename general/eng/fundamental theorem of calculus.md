# fundamental theorem of calculus

## formal statements

### first part

The first part is sometimes called the _first fundamental theorem of calculus_.

> {@{__first fundamental theorem of calculus__}@}
>
> Given {@{a [real-valued function](real-valued%20function.md) $f$ [continuous](continuous%20function.md) on a closed [interval](interval%20(mathematics).md) $[a,b]$}@}, define {@{$F$ as the [Riemann integral](Riemann%20integral.md) $$F(x)=\int_a^x\!f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t\quad\forall{x}\in[a,b]$$}@}. Then {@{$F$ is an [antiderivative](antiderivative.md) of $f$ on the open [interval](interval%20(mathematics).md) $(a,b)$}@}, i.e. {@{$$F'(x)=f(x)\quad\forall{x}\in(a,b)$$}@}. $F$ is {@{[uniformly continuous](uniformly%20continuous.md) on $[a,b]$ and [differentiable](differentiable%20function.md) on $(a,b)$}@}.

The first part implies that when $f$ is [continuous](continuous%20function.md), {@{[antiderivatives](antiderivative.md) of $f$ always exists}@}.

The conditions above can be relaxed. If $f$ is {@{[Lebesgue integrable](Lebesgue%20integration.md) on $[a, b]$, and [continuous](continuous%20function.md) at $x_0 \in (a, b)$}@}, then {@{$F$ is [differentiable](differentiable%20function.md) at $x_0$ and $F'(x_0) = f(x_0)$}@}. This is still valid for the more general {@{[Henstock–Kurzweil integral](Henstock–Kurzweil%20integral.md)}@}.

Additionally, if {@{$f$ is [Lebesgue integrable](Lebesgue%20integrable.md), then $F$ is [absolutely continuous](absolute%20continuity.md)}@}.

### corollary

> __corollary of the first fundamental theorem of calculus__
>
> {@{Given a [real-valued function](real-valued%20function.md) $f$ [continuous](continuous%20function.md) on a closed [interval](interval%20(mathematics).md) $[a,b]$ and $F$ an [antiderivative](antiderivative.md) of $f$ in $(a,b)$, i.e. $$F'(x)=f(x)\quad\forall{x}\in(a,b)$$, then $$\int_a^b\!f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t=F(b)-F(a)$$.}@}

The corollary requires {@{$f$ to be [continuous](continuous%20function.md) on the entire [interval](interval%20(mathematics).md). This condition is removed in the [second part of the theorem](#second%20part)}@}.

### second part

The second part is sometimes called the _second fundamental theorem of calculus_, or the __{@{Newton-Leibniz}@} theorem__.

> {@{__second fundamental theorem of calculus__}@}
>
> Given {@{a [real-valued function](real-valued%20function.md) $f$ [Riemann integrable](Riemann%20integral.md#Riemann%20integrable) on a closed [interval](interval%20(mathematics).md) $[a,b]$}@} and {@{$F$ a [continuous function](continuous%20function.md) on $[a,b]$ which is an [antiderivative](antiderivative.md) of $f$ in $(a,b)$}@}, i.e. {@{$$F'(x)=f(x)\quad\forall{x}\in(a,b)$$}@}, then {@{$$\int_a^b\!f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t=F(b)-F(a)$$}@}.

The second part is {@{stronger than the [corollary](#corollary) because $f$ may not be [continuous](continuous%20function.md)}@}.

The conditions above can be relaxed. The result still holds if {@{$f$ is [Lebesgue integrable](Lebesgue%20integration.md) instead}@}. Continuing with the replaced definition, however, if {@{$F$ admits a derivative _[almost everywhere](almost%20everywhere.md)_ instead of everywhere}@}, this result may fail. Instead, if {@{$F$ is [absolutely continuous](absolute%20continuity.md), then it admits a derivative $f$ almost everywhere, $f$ is Lebesgue integrable, and the above result holds again. Note that we do not need to show that $f$ is integrable first (when $F$ is absolutely continuous)}@}.

If the even more general {@{[Henstock–Kurzweil integral](Henstock–Kurzweil%20integral.md) is used}@}, then if {@{a [continuous function](continuous%20function.md) $F$ admits an [antiderivative](antiderivative.md) $f$ at all but _countably_ many points (not the same as almost everywhere), then $f$ is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable and the above results hold. Note that we do not need to show that $f$ is integrable first}@}.
