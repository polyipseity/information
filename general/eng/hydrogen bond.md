# hydrogen bond

A __hydrogen bond__ or __H-bond__ is {@{an [electrostatic](electrostatics.md) attraction [force](force.md) between a [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) atom (H) [covalently bound](covalent%20bond.md) to a more [electronegative](electronegativity.md) donor [atom](atom.md) or group (Dn), and another electronegative acceptor atom with a [lone electron pair](lone%20pair.md) (Ac)}@}. It is represented as {@{Dn−H···Ac}@}. The donor and acceptor atoms are usually {@{[fluorine](fluorine.md), [oxygen](oxygen.md), or [nitrogen](nitrogen.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-10,657,210!2026-07-06,854,330!2031-09-04,2328,330-->

The hydrogen bond is important in {@{[DNAs](DNA.md) to maintain its double helix structure and [water](water.md) for its exceptional [properties](property.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-06-19,1089,290-->

## examples

### water

Hydrogen bonds are responsible for {@{the high [boiling point](boiling%20point.md), [surface tension](surface%20tension.md), and [viscosity](viscosity.md)}@} of [water](water.md). It also makes [ethanol](ethanol.md) {@{[miscible](miscibility.md) in all portions}@} with water. <!--SR:!2026-06-23,712,250!2028-07-26,1513,350-->
