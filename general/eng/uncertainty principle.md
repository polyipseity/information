# uncertainty principle

The __uncertainty principle__, also known as {@{__Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle__}@}, is {@{a fundamental concept in [quantum mechanics](quantum%20mechanics.md). It states that there is a limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and [momentum](momentum.md), can be simultaneously known}@}. In other words, {@{the more accurately one property is measured, the less accurately the other property can be known}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-30,191,310!2025-06-25,251,330!2025-03-29,172,310-->
