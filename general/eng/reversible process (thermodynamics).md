# reversible process (thermodynamics)

Throughout a reversible process, {@{the system is always in [thermodynamic equilibrium](thermodynamic%20equilibrium.md) physically and chemically within itself and with its surroundings. This prevents [entropy production](entropy%20production.md) by dissipative forces like [friction](friction.md)}@}.
