## history

The vector concept, as it is known today, is the result of a gradual development over a period of more than 200 years. About a dozen people contributed significantly to its development.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> In 1835, [Giusto Bellavitis](Giusto%20Bellavitis.md) abstracted the basic idea when he established the concept of [equipollence](equipollence%20(geometry).md). Working in a Euclidean plane, he made equipollent any pair of [parallel](parallel%20(geometry).md) line segments of the same length and orientation. Essentially, he realized an [equivalence relation](equivalence%20relation.md) on the pairs of points \(bipoints\) in the plane, and thus erected the first space of vectors in the plane.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup><sup>:&hairsp;52–4&hairsp;</sup> The term _vector_ was introduced by [William Rowan Hamilton](William%20Rowan%20Hamilton.md) as part of a [quaternion](quaternion.md), which is a sum _q_ = _s_ + _v_ of a [real number](real%20number.md) _s_ \(also called _scalar_\) and a 3-dimensional _vector_. Like Bellavitis, Hamilton viewed vectors as representative of [classes](equivalence%20class.md) of equipollent directed segments. As [complex numbers](complex%20number.md) use an [imaginary unit](imaginary%20unit.md) to complement the [real line](real%20line.md), Hamilton considered the vector _v_ to be the _imaginary part_ of a quaternion:<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup>

> The algebraically imaginary part, being geometrically constructed by a straight line, or radius vector, which has, in general, for each determined quaternion, a determined length and determined direction in space, may be called the vector part, or simply the vector of the quaternion.

Several other mathematicians developed vector-like systems in the middle of the nineteenth century, including [Augustin Cauchy](Augustin%20Cauchy.md), [Hermann Grassmann](Hermann%20Grassmann.md), [August Möbius](August%20Möbius.md), [Comte de Saint-Venant](Comte%20de%20Saint-Venant.md), and [Matthew O'Brien](Matthew%20O'Brien%20(mathematician).md). Grassmann's 1840 work _Theorie der Ebbe und Flut_ \(Theory of the Ebb and Flow\) was the first system of spatial analysis that is similar to today's system, and had ideas corresponding to the cross product, scalar product and vector differentiation. Grassmann's work was largely neglected until the 1870s.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> [Peter Guthrie Tait](Peter%20Guthrie%20Tait.md) carried the quaternion standard after Hamilton. His 1867 _Elementary Treatise of Quaternions_ included extensive treatment of the nabla or [del operator](del.md) ∇. In 1878, _[Elements of Dynamic](Elements%20of%20Dynamic.md)_ was published by [William Kingdon Clifford](William%20Kingdon%20Clifford.md). Clifford simplified the quaternion study by isolating the [dot product](dot%20product.md) and [cross product](cross%20product.md) of two vectors from the complete quaternion product. This approach made vector calculations available to engineers—and others working in three dimensions and skeptical of the fourth.

[Josiah Willard Gibbs](Josiah%20Willard%20Gibbs.md), who was exposed to quaternions through [James Clerk Maxwell](James%20Clerk%20Maxwell.md)'s _Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism_, separated off their vector part for independent treatment. The first half of Gibbs's _Elements of Vector Analysis_, published in 1881, presents what is essentially the modern system of vector analysis.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup><sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> In 1901, [Edwin Bidwell Wilson](Edwin%20Bidwell%20Wilson.md) published _[Vector Analysis](Vector%20Analysis.md)_, adapted from Gibbs's lectures, which banished any mention of quaternions in the development of vector calculus.

## overview

In {@{[physics](physics.md) and [engineering](engineering.md)}@}, a vector is typically regarded as {@{a geometric entity characterized by a [magnitude](magnitude%20(mathematics).md) and a [relative direction](relative%20direction.md)}@}. It is formally defined as {@{a [directed line segment](directed%20line%20segment.md#directed%20line%20segment), or arrow, in a [Euclidean space](Euclidean%20space.md)}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> In {@{[pure mathematics](pure%20mathematics.md)}@}, a [vector](vector%20(mathematics).md) is defined {@{more generally as any element of a [vector space](vector%20space.md)}@}. In this context, vectors are {@{abstract entities which may or may not be characterized by a magnitude and a direction}@}. This generalized definition implies that {@{the above-mentioned geometric entities are a special kind of abstract vectors}@}, as they are {@{elements of a special kind of vector space called [Euclidean space](Euclidean%20space.md)}@}. This particular article is about {@{vectors strictly defined as arrows in Euclidean space}@}. When it becomes {@{necessary to distinguish these special vectors from vectors as defined in pure mathematics}@}, they are sometimes referred to as {@{___geometric___, ___spatial___, or ___Euclidean___ vectors}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-28,369,359!2026-05-09,355,352!2026-05-18,362,359!2026-05-09,350,352!2029-08-26,1289,352!2026-05-06,347,352!2026-05-07,353,352!2026-05-14,355,352!2028-02-27,838,332!2029-08-31,1295,352!2029-08-04,1272,352-->

A Euclidean vector may possess {@{a definite _initial point_ and _terminal point_}@}; {@{such a condition may be emphasized}@} calling the result {@{a ___bound vector___}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> When {@{only the magnitude and direction of the vector matter, and the particular initial or terminal points are of no importance}@}, the vector is called {@{a ___free vector___}@}. {@{The distinction between bound and free vectors}@} is especially {@{relevant in mechanics}@}, where {@{a [force](force.md) applied to a body has a point of contact}@} \(see {@{[resultant force](resultant%20force.md) and [couple](couple%20(mechanics).md)}@}\). <!--SR:!2029-08-16,1282,352!2029-03-08,1149,352!2026-05-22,364,359!2026-04-15,331,352!2026-05-05,349,352!2026-05-14,356,359!2026-03-12,292,332!2028-11-02,1052,352!2026-06-13,384,359-->

Two arrows ${\stackrel {\,\longrightarrow }{AB} }$ and ${\stackrel {\,\longrightarrow }{A'B'} }$ in space {@{represent the same free vector}@} if {@{they have the same magnitude and direction}@}: that is, they are {@{[equipollent](equipollence%20(geometry).md) if the quadrilateral _ABB′A′_ is a [parallelogram](parallelogram.md)}@}. If {@{the Euclidean space is equipped with a choice of [origin](origin%20(mathematics).md)}@}, then a free vector is equivalent to {@{the bound vector of the same magnitude and direction whose initial point is the origin}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-02,374,359!2026-06-13,384,359!2029-09-24,1313,352!2026-03-16,296,332!2029-08-13,1281,352-->

{@{The term _vector_}@} also has {@{generalizations to higher dimensions}@}, and to {@{more formal approaches with much wider applications}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-18,359,359!2026-05-01,342,352!2029-03-29,1170,352-->

### further information

In {@{classical [Euclidean geometry](Euclidean%20geometry.md) \(i.e., [synthetic geometry](synthetic%20geometry.md)\)}@}, vectors were {@{introduced \(during the 19th century\) as [equivalence classes](equivalence%20class.md) under [equipollence](equipollence%20(geometry).md), of [ordered pairs](ordered%20pair.md) of points}@}; {@{two pairs \(_A_, _B_\) and \(_C_, _D_\) being equipollent}@} if {@{the points _A_, _B_, _D_, _C_, in this order, form a [parallelogram](parallelogram.md)}@}. Such an equivalence class is called {@{a _vector_, more precisely, a Euclidean vector}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> {@{The equivalence class of \(_A_, _B_\)}@} is often denoted {@{${\overrightarrow {AB} }$}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-25,1194,352!2026-05-08,354,352!2026-05-12,353,352!2029-03-03,1144,352!2029-04-14,1186,352!2026-05-02,348,352!2029-09-20,1311,352-->

A Euclidean vector is thus {@{an equivalence class of directed segments with the same magnitude \(e.g., the length of the [line segment](line%20segment.md) \(_A_, _B_\)\)}@} and {@{same direction \(e.g., the direction from _A_ to _B_\)}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> In {@{physics}@}, Euclidean vectors are used to {@{represent physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction}@}, but {@{are not located at a specific place}@}, in contrast to {@{[scalars](scalar%20(mathematics).md), which have no direction}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> For example, {@{[velocity](velocity.md), [forces](force.md) and [acceleration](acceleration.md)}@} are represented by vectors. <!--SR:!2026-05-07,348,352!2026-05-02,348,352!2029-07-15,1261,352!2029-01-20,1102,352!2026-05-14,355,352!2029-07-13,1259,352!2026-05-29,370,359-->

In {@{modern geometry}@}, Euclidean spaces are often defined {@{from [linear algebra](linear%20algebra.md)}@}. More precisely, a Euclidean space _E_ is defined as {@{a set to which is associated an [inner product space](inner%20product%20space.md) of finite dimension over the reals ${\overrightarrow {E} }$ (annotation: we have the inner product operation)}@}, and {@{a [group action](group%20action%20(mathematics).md) of the [additive group](additive%20group.md) of ${\overrightarrow {E} }$, which is [free](free%20action.md#free) and [transitive](transitive%20action.md#transitivity%20properties) (annotation: we can add vectors intuitively)}@} \(See {@{[Affine space](affine%20space.md) for details of this construction}@}\). {@{The elements of ${\overrightarrow {E} }$}@} are called {@{[translations](translation%20(geometry).md)}@}. It has been proven that {@{the two definitions of Euclidean spaces are equivalent}@}, and that {@{the equivalence classes under equipollence may be identified with translations}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-26,367,359!2026-05-08,354,352!2028-11-30,1075,352!2027-07-29,616,312!2029-08-18,1285,352!2026-05-05,351,352!2029-03-27,1168,352!2026-04-19,335,352!2026-05-09,350,352-->

Sometimes, Euclidean vectors are {@{considered without reference to a Euclidean space}@}. In this case, a Euclidean vector is {@{an element of a normed vector space of finite dimension over the reals}@}, or, typically, {@{an element of the [real coordinate space](real%20coordinate%20space.md) $\mathbb {R} ^{n}$ equipped with the [dot product](dot%20product.md)}@}. This makes sense, as {@{the addition in such a vector space}@} {@{acts freely and transitively on the vector space itself}@}. That is, {@{$\mathbb {R} ^{n}$}@} is {@{a Euclidean space}@}, with {@{itself as an associated vector space, and the dot product as an inner product}@}. <!--SR:!2029-09-04,1288,359!2026-05-04,350,352!2029-08-10,1278,352!2026-05-02,348,352!2029-07-03,1249,352!2029-01-24,1106,352!2028-07-17,900,332!2026-03-06,24,387-->

{@{The Euclidean space $\mathbb {R} ^{n}$}@} is often presented as {@{_the_ [standard Euclidean space](Standard%20Euclidean%20space.md#standard) of dimension _n_}@}. This is motivated by the fact that {@{every Euclidean space of dimension _n_ is [isomorphic](isomorphism.md) to the Euclidean space $\mathbb {R} ^{n}$}@}. More precisely, given {@{such a Euclidean space}@}, one may {@{choose any point _O_ as an [origin](origin%20(geometry).md)}@}. By {@{[Gram–Schmidt process](Gram–Schmidt%20process.md)}@}, one may also {@{find an [orthonormal basis](orthonormal%20basis.md) of the associated vector space}@} \(a basis such that {@{the inner product of two basis vectors is 0 if they are different and 1 if they are equal}@}\). This defines {@{[Cartesian coordinates](Cartesian%20coordinates.md) of any point _P_ of the space}@}, as {@{the coordinates on this basis of the vector ${\overrightarrow {OP} }$}@}. These choices define {@{an isomorphism of the given Euclidean space onto $\mathbb {R} ^{n}$}@}, by {@{mapping any point to the [_n_-tuple](tuple.md) of its Cartesian coordinates}@}, and {@{every vector to its [coordinate vector](coordinate%20vector.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-18,359,359!2026-05-03,349,352!2026-05-08,349,352!2029-03-23,1164,352!2026-05-18,359,359!2026-03-13,298,332!2026-03-07,292,332!2029-08-26,1291,352!2026-06-14,384,359!2026-05-17,358,359!2026-06-17,388,359!2029-08-11,1277,352!2026-05-18,359,359-->

### examples in one dimension

Since {@{the physicist's concept of [force](force%20(physics).md)}@} has {@{a direction and a magnitude}@}, it may be {@{seen as a vector}@}. As an example, consider {@{a rightward force _F_ of 15 [newtons](newton%20(unit).md)}@}. If {@{the positive [axis](Cartesian%20coordinate%20system.md) is also directed rightward}@}, then _F_ is represented by {@{the vector 15 N}@}, and if {@{positive points leftward, then the vector for _F_ is −15 N}@}. In either case, {@{the magnitude of the vector is 15 N}@}. Likewise, {@{the vector representation of a displacement Δ<!-- markdown separator -->_s_ of 4 [meters](meter%20(unit).md)}@} would be {@{4 m or −4 m, depending on its direction}@}, and {@{its magnitude would be 4 m}@} regardless. <!--SR:!2029-03-26,1167,352!2026-05-13,354,352!2026-05-07,349,352!2026-05-17,359,359!2026-05-09,350,352!2026-03-08,291,332!2026-05-14,355,352!2026-04-29,345,352!2026-03-12,292,332!2026-05-27,368,359!2029-03-28,1169,352-->

### in physics and engineering

Vectors are {@{fundamental in the physical sciences}@}. They can be used to {@{represent any quantity that has magnitude, has direction, and which adheres to the rules of vector addition}@}. An example is {@{[velocity](velocity.md), the magnitude of which is [speed](speed.md)}@}. For instance, {@{the velocity _5 meters per second upward_}@} could be represented by {@{the vector \(0, 5\) \(in 2 dimensions with the positive _y_-axis as 'up'\)}@}. Another quantity represented by a vector is {@{[force](force.md)}@}, since {@{it has a magnitude and direction and follows the rules of vector addition}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> Vectors also {@{describe many other physical quantities}@}, such as {@{linear displacement, [displacement](displacement%20(vector).md), linear acceleration, [angular acceleration](angular%20acceleration.md), [linear momentum](linear%20momentum.md), and [angular momentum](angular%20momentum.md)}@}. Other physical vectors, such as {@{the [electric](electric%20field.md) and [magnetic field](magnetic%20field.md)}@}, are represented as {@{a system of vectors at each point of a physical space}@}; that is, {@{a [vector field](vector%20field.md)}@}. Examples of {@{quantities that have magnitude and direction, but fail to follow the rules of vector addition}@}, are {@{angular displacement and electric current}@}. Consequently, {@{these are not vectors}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-12,1184,352!2029-08-25,1290,352!2026-06-01,373,359!2026-03-15,300,332!2026-05-14,355,352!2029-05-28,1226,359!2026-05-08,349,352!2026-04-14,325,352!2029-06-25,1238,352!2026-05-25,366,359!2029-08-11,1279,352!2026-04-23,339,352!2026-05-19,360,359!2029-03-27,1168,352!2026-05-07,353,352-->

### In Cartesian space

In {@{the [Cartesian coordinate system](Cartesian%20coordinate%20system.md)}@}, {@{a bound vector}@} can be represented by {@{identifying the coordinates of its initial and terminal point}@}. For instance, {@{the points _A_ = \(1, 0, 0\) and _B_ = \(0, 1, 0\) in space}@} determine {@{the bound vector ${\overrightarrow {AB} }$ pointing from the point _x_ = 1 on the _x_-axis to the point _y_ = 1 on the _y_-axis}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-12,297,332!2026-06-05,377,359!2026-04-30,346,352!2027-11-10,767,332!2029-03-14,1155,352-->

In {@{Cartesian coordinates}@}, a free vector may be thought of {@{in terms of a corresponding bound vector}@}, in this sense, whose {@{initial point has the coordinates of the origin _O_ = \(0, 0, 0\)}@}. It is then {@{determined by the coordinates of that bound vector's terminal point}@}.

### Euclidean and affine vectors

In {@{the geometrical and physical settings}@}, it is sometimes possible to {@{associate, in a natural way, a _length_ or magnitude and a direction to vectors}@}. In addition, {@{the notion of direction}@} is strictly associated with {@{the notion of an _angle_ between two vectors}@}. If {@{the [dot product](dot%20product.md) of two vectors is defined}@}—{@{a scalar-valued product of two vectors}@}—then {@{it is also possible to define a length}@}; the dot product gives {@{a convenient algebraic characterization of both angle \(a function of the dot product between any two non-zero vectors\) and length \(the square root of the dot product of a vector by itself\)}@}. In {@{three dimensions}@}, it is further possible to {@{define the [cross product](cross%20product.md)}@}, which supplies {@{an algebraic characterization of the [area](area.md) and [orientation](orientation%20(geometry).md)}@} in {@{space of the [parallelogram](parallelogram.md) defined by two vectors \(used as sides of the parallelogram\)}@}. In {@{any dimension \(and, in particular, higher dimensions\)}@}, it is possible to {@{define the [exterior product](exterior%20product.md)}@}, which \(among other things\) supplies {@{an algebraic characterization of the area and orientation in space of the _n_-dimensional [parallelotope](parallelepiped.md#parallelotope) defined by _n_ vectors}@}. <!--SR:!2029-07-02,1248,352!2026-05-09,350,352!2026-03-10,295,332!2026-06-16,387,359!2029-04-07,1179,352!2026-05-17,358,359!2026-03-06,286,332!2029-08-20,1287,352!2029-07-04,1250,352!2026-05-04,350,352!2029-09-01,1295,352!2026-05-16,357,359!2026-05-09,355,352!2026-03-10,291,332!2026-05-07,348,352-->

In {@{a [pseudo-Euclidean space](pseudo-Euclidean%20space.md)}@}, {@{a vector's squared length}@} can be {@{positive, negative, or zero}@}. An important example is {@{[Minkowski space](Minkowski%20space.md)}@} \(which is {@{important to our understanding of [special relativity](special%20relativity.md)}@}\). <!--SR:!2026-06-05,377,359!2026-05-21,362,359!2026-03-15,295,332!2029-09-01,1297,352!2026-05-14,355,352-->

However, it is not {@{always possible or desirable to define the length of a vector}@}. {@{This more general type of spatial vector}@} is {@{the subject of [vector spaces](vector%20space.md) \(for free vectors\)}@} and {@{[affine spaces](affine%20space.md) \(for bound vectors, as each represented by an ordered pair of "points"\)}@}. One physical example comes from {@{[thermodynamics](thermodynamics.md)}@}, where {@{many quantities of interest}@} can be {@{considered vectors in a space with no notion of length or angle}@}.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-03-11,291,332!2029-04-06,1178,352!2026-03-05,290,332!2026-03-13,298,332!2026-05-11,352,352!2026-05-29,370,359!2026-04-13,324,352-->

### generalizations

In {@{physics, as well as mathematics}@}, a vector is often {@{identified with a [tuple](tuple.md) of components, or list of numbers}@}, that {@{act as scalar coefficients for a set of [basis vectors](basis%20vector.md)}@}. When {@{the basis is transformed}@}, for example by {@{rotation or stretching}@}, then {@{the components of any vector in terms of that basis also transform in an opposite sense}@}. {@{The vector itself has not changed}@}, but {@{the basis has}@}, so {@{the components of the vector must change to compensate}@}. The vector is called {@{_covariant_ or _contravariant_}@}, depending on {@{how the transformation of the vector's components is related to the transformation of the basis}@}. In general, {@{contravariant vectors}@} are {@{"regular vectors" with units of distance \(such as a displacement\), or distance times some other unit \(such as velocity or acceleration\)}@}; {@{covariant vectors}@}, on the other hand, have {@{units of one-over-distance such as [gradient](gradient.md)}@}. If {@{you change units \(a special case of a [change of basis](change%20of%20basis.md)\) from meters to millimeters}@}, {@{a scale factor of 1/1000}@}, {@{a displacement of 1 m becomes 1000 mm}@}—{@{a contravariant change in numerical value}@}. In contrast, {@{a gradient of 1 [K](Kelvin.md)/m becomes 0.001 K/mm}@}—{@{a covariant change in value}@} \(for more, see {@{[covariance and contravariance of vectors](covariance%20and%20contravariance%20of%20vectors.md)}@}\). {@{[Tensors](tensor.md)}@} are {@{another type of quantity that behave in this way}@}; a vector is {@{one type of [tensor](tensor.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-08-15,1283,352!2029-02-26,1139,352!2026-03-15,300,332!2026-05-05,346,352!2026-05-14,355,352!2028-06-15,951,352!2026-05-06,352,352!2029-06-17,1235,352!2026-03-03,288,332!2029-04-15,1187,352!2029-04-23,1192,352!2026-03-14,299,332!2029-02-07,1120,352!2026-05-12,353,352!2026-05-06,352,352!2029-05-13,1204,352!2026-05-21,362,359!2026-06-01,373,359!2029-07-27,1266,352!2027-03-24,537,312!2026-05-27,368,359!2028-06-06,943,352!2026-06-13,327,312!2026-05-07,353,352!2029-08-04,1276,352-->

In {@{pure [mathematics](mathematics.md)}@}, a vector is {@{any element of a [vector space](vector%20space.md) over some [field](field%20(mathematics).md)}@} and is often {@{represented as a [coordinate vector](coordinate%20vector.md)}@}. The vectors described in this article are {@{a very special case of this general definition}@}, because {@{they are contravariant with respect to the ambient space}@}. {@{Contravariance}@} captures {@{the physical intuition behind the idea that a vector has "magnitude and direction"}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-08,349,352!2026-05-14,355,352!2026-05-02,348,352!2026-03-18,299,332!2026-05-14,355,352!2026-06-11,383,359!2026-05-16,357,359-->

Vectors are usually {@{denoted in [lowercase](lowercase.md) boldface, as in $\mathbf {u}$<!-- markdown separator -->__,__ $\mathbf {v}$ and $\mathbf {w}$}@}, or in {@{lowercase italic boldface, as in ___a___}@}. \({@{[Uppercase](uppercase.md) letters}@} are typically {@{used to represent [matrices](matrix%20(mathematics).md)}@}.\) Other conventions include {@{${\vec {a} }$ or <u>_a_</u>, especially in handwriting}@}. Alternatively, some use {@{a [tilde](tilde.md) \(~\) or a wavy underline drawn beneath the symbol, e.g. ${\underset {^{\sim } }{a} }$}@}, which is {@{a convention for indicating boldface type}@}. If {@{the vector represents a directed [distance](distance.md) or [displacement](displacement%20(vector).md) from a point _A_ to a point _B_ \(see figure\)}@}, it can also be denoted as {@{${\stackrel {\longrightarrow }{AB} }$ or <u>_AB_</u>}@}.

In order to {@{calculate with vectors}@}, {@{the graphical representation may be too cumbersome}@}. {@{Vectors in an _n_-dimensional Euclidean space}@} can be {@{represented as [coordinate vectors](coordinate%20vector.md) in a [Cartesian coordinate system](Cartesian%20coordinate%20system.md)}@}. {@{The endpoint of a vector}@} can be identified with {@{an ordered list of _n_ real numbers \(_n_-[tuple](tuple.md)\)}@}. These numbers are {@{the [coordinates](Cartesian%20coordinate.md) of the endpoint of the vector}@}, with respect to {@{a given [Cartesian coordinate system](Cartesian%20coordinate%20system.md)}@}, and are typically called {@{the _[scalar components](scalar%20component.md)_ \(or _scalar projections_\)}@} of {@{the vector on the axes of the coordinate system}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-22,363,359!2026-05-12,353,352!2026-06-03,375,359!2026-05-18,359,359!2029-01-31,1113,352!2026-05-02,348,352!2026-03-06,291,332!2029-04-03,1175,352!2026-05-17,358,359!2026-05-06,347,352-->

As {@{an example in two dimensions \(see figure\)}@}, {@{the vector from the origin _O_ = \(0, 0\) to the point _A_ = \(2, 3\)}@} is simply written as {@{$$\mathbf {a} =(2,3).$$}@} {@{The notion that the tail of the vector coincides with the origin}@} is {@{implicit and easily understood}@}. Thus, {@{the more explicit notation ${\overrightarrow {OA} }$}@} is {@{usually deemed not necessary \(and is indeed rarely used\)}@}. In {@{_three dimensional_ Euclidean space \(or __R__<sup>3</sup>\)}@}, vectors are {@{identified with triples of scalar components}@}: {@{$$\mathbf {a} =(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}).$$ also written, $$\mathbf {a} =(a_{x},a_{y},a_{z}).$$}@} This can be {@{generalised to _n-dimensional_ Euclidean space \(or __R__<sup>_n_</sup>\)}@}. {@{$$\mathbf {a} =(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\cdots ,a_{n-1},a_{n}).$$}@} These numbers are often {@{arranged into a [column vector](column%20vector.md) or [row vector](row%20vector.md)}@}, particularly when {@{dealing with [matrices](matrix%20(mathematics).md)}@}, as follows: {@{$$\mathbf {a} ={\begin{bmatrix}a_{1}\\a_{2}\\a_{3}\\\end{bmatrix} }=[a_{1}\ a_{2}\ a_{3}]^{\operatorname {T} }.$$}@} Another way to represent a vector in _n_-dimensions is to {@{introduce the [standard basis](standard%20basis.md) vectors}@}. For instance, in three dimensions, there are {@{three of them: $${\mathbf {e} }_{1}=(1,0,0),\ {\mathbf {e} }_{2}=(0,1,0),\ {\mathbf {e} }_{3}=(0,0,1).$$}@} These have the intuitive interpretation as {@{vectors of unit length pointing up the _x_-, _y_-, and _z_-axis of a [Cartesian coordinate system](Cartesian%20coordinate%20system.md), respectively}@}. In terms of these, {@{any vector __a__ in __R__<sup>3</sup> can be expressed in the form}@}: {@{$$\mathbf {a} =(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3})=a_{1}(1,0,0)+a_{2}(0,1,0)+a_{3}(0,0,1),\ {}$$ or $$\mathbf {a} =\mathbf {a} _{1}+\mathbf {a} _{2}+\mathbf {a} _{3}=a_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+a_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+a_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3},$$}@} where {@{__a__<sub>1</sub>, __a__<sub>2</sub>, __a__<sub>3</sub>}@} are called {@{the __[vector components](vector%20component.md#decomposition)__ \(or __vector projections__\) of __a__ on the basis vectors}@} or, equivalently, on {@{the corresponding Cartesian axes _x_, _y_, and _z_}@} \(see figure\), while {@{_a_<sub>1</sub>, _a_<sub>2</sub>, _a_<sub>3</sub> are the respective [scalar components](scalar%20component.md) \(or scalar projections\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-09,350,352!2026-06-19,390,359!2026-06-16,387,359!2026-05-20,361,359!2026-04-21,332,352!2026-05-07,348,352!2026-05-14,355,352!2029-03-15,1156,352!2029-09-22,1312,352!2026-03-14,299,332!2029-08-10,1279,352!2026-05-10,354,352!2026-03-15,300,332!2029-10-07,1325,352!2029-01-19,1101,352!2026-05-12,353,352!2026-05-13,354,352!2026-06-19,389,359!2026-03-03,283,332!2029-03-17,1158,352!2026-05-09,350,352!2026-03-05,290,332!2029-04-11,1183,352!2026-05-04,350,352-->

The following section uses {@{the [Cartesian coordinate system](Cartesian%20coordinate%20system.md) with basis vectors $${\mathbf {e} }_{1}=(1,0,0),\ {\mathbf {e} }_{2}=(0,1,0),\ {\mathbf {e} }_{3}=(0,0,1)$$}@} and assumes that {@{all vectors have the origin as a common base point}@}. A vector __a__ will be written as {@{$${\mathbf {a} }=a_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+a_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+a_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}.$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-05-26,367,359!2026-05-17,361,359!2026-04-25,336,352-->

### equality

{@{Two vectors are said to be equal}@} if {@{they have the same magnitude and direction}@}. Equivalently {@{they will be equal if their coordinates are equal}@}. So {@{two vectors $${\mathbf {a} }=a_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+a_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+a_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}$$ and $${\mathbf {b} }=b_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+b_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+b_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}$$ are equal}@} if {@{$$a_{1}=b_{1},\quad a_{2}=b_{2},\quad a_{3}=b_{3}.\,$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-05-11,355,352!2029-10-10,1318,352!2029-09-13,1304,352!2026-05-02,348,352!2029-04-21,1190,352-->

### opposite, parallel, and antiparallel vectors

{@{Two vectors are _opposite_}@} if {@{they have the same magnitude but [opposite direction](opposite%20direction%20(geometry).md)}@};<sup>[\[18\]](#^ref-18)</sup> so {@{two vectors $${\mathbf {a} }=a_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+a_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+a_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}$$ and $${\mathbf {b} }=b_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+b_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+b_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}$$ are opposite}@} if {@{$$a_{1}=-b_{1},\quad a_{2}=-b_{2},\quad a_{3}=-b_{3}.\,$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-05-28,369,359!2026-04-29,345,352!2026-05-31,372,359!2029-04-11,1183,352-->

### addition and subtraction

- Further information: [Vector space](vector%20space.md)

{@{The sum of __a__ and __b__ of two vectors}@} may be {@{defined as $$\mathbf {a} +\mathbf {b} =(a_{1}+b_{1})\mathbf {e} _{1}+(a_{2}+b_{2})\mathbf {e} _{2}+(a_{3}+b_{3})\mathbf {e} _{3}.$$}@} The resulting vector is sometimes called {@{the __resultant vector__ of __a__ and __b__}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-04,350,352!2026-04-10,321,352!2026-03-15,296,332-->

{@{The addition may be represented graphically}@} by {@{placing the tail of the arrow __b__ at the head of the arrow __a__}@}, and then {@{drawing an arrow from the tail of __a__ to the head of __b__}@}. {@{The new arrow drawn}@} represents {@{the vector __a__ + __b__}@}, as illustrated below:<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <p> &emsp; {@{![The addition of two vectors a and b](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Vector%20addition.svg)}@} <p> This addition method is sometimes called {@{the _parallelogram rule_}@} because {@{__a__ and __b__ form the sides of a [parallelogram](parallelogram.md) and __a__ + __b__ is one of the diagonals}@}. If {@{__a__ and __b__ are bound vectors that have the same base point}@}, this point will {@{also be the base point of __a__ + __b__}@}. One can check geometrically that {@{__a__ + __b__ = __b__ + __a__ and \(__a__ + __b__\) + __c__ = __a__ + \(__b__ + __c__\)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-09,1181,352!2026-05-14,355,352!2029-08-26,1292,352!2026-05-14,355,352!2029-04-09,1181,352!2026-04-20,336,352!2026-05-14,355,352!2026-03-10,295,332!2026-05-01,347,352!2026-03-10,295,332!2026-04-24,340,352-->

{@{The difference of __a__ and __b__}@} is {@{$$\mathbf {a} -\mathbf {b} =(a_{1}-b_{1})\mathbf {e} _{1}+(a_{2}-b_{2})\mathbf {e} _{2}+(a_{3}-b_{3})\mathbf {e} _{3}.$$}@} Subtraction of two vectors can be {@{geometrically illustrated as follows}@}: to {@{subtract __b__ from __a__}@}, {@{place the tails of __a__ and __b__ at the same point}@}, and then {@{draw an arrow from the head of __b__ to the head of __a__}@}. This new arrow represents {@{the vector __\(-b\)__ + __a__, with __\(-b\)__ being the opposite of __b__}@}, see drawing. And {@{__\(-b\)__ + __a__ = __a__ − __b__}@}. <p> &emsp; {@{![The subtraction of two vectors a and b](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Vector%20subtraction.svg)}@} <!--SR:!2026-03-11,296,332!2026-05-03,349,352!2029-09-19,1310,352!2026-03-12,292,332!2026-05-24,365,359!2026-05-23,364,359!2026-04-20,336,352!2026-05-01,347,352!2026-03-17,297,332-->

### scalar multiplication

A vector may also be {@{multiplied, or re-_scaled_, by any [real number](real%20number.md) _r_}@}. In {@{the context of [conventional vector algebra](vector%20analysis.md)}@}, these real numbers are often called {@{__scalars__ \(from _scale_\) to distinguish them from vectors}@}. {@{The operation of multiplying a vector by a scalar}@} is called {@{_scalar multiplication_}@}. The resulting vector is {@{$$r\mathbf {a} =(ra_{1})\mathbf {e} _{1}+(ra_{2})\mathbf {e} _{2}+(ra_{3})\mathbf {e} _{3}.$$}@} Intuitively, {@{multiplying by a scalar _r_ stretches a vector out by a factor of _r_}@}. Geometrically, this can be visualized \(at least in {@{the case when _r_ is an integer}@}\) as {@{placing _r_ copies of the vector in a line where the endpoint of one vector is the initial point of the next vector}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-03,349,352!2026-05-27,369,359!2026-03-10,295,332!2026-06-14,385,359!2026-03-14,299,332!2026-03-07,287,332!2029-02-16,1129,352!2026-06-10,381,359!2029-10-06,1315,352-->

If {@{_r_ is negative}@}, then {@{the vector changes direction: it flips around by an angle of 180°}@}. Two examples \(_r_ = −1 and _r_ = 2\) are given below: <!--SR:!2026-06-13,383,359!2029-03-24,1165,352-->

Scalar multiplication is {@{[distributive](distributivity.md) over vector addition}@} in the following sense: {@{_r_\(__a__ + __b__\) = _r_<!-- markdown separator -->__a__+ _r_<!-- markdown separator -->__b__ for all vectors __a__ and __b__ and all scalars _r_}@}. One can also show that {@{__a__ − __b__ = __a__ + \(−1\)__b__}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-20,1189,352!2026-05-09,355,352!2029-05-06,1204,352-->

### length

{@{The _[length](length.md)_, _[magnitude](magnitude%20(mathematics).md)_ or _[norm](norm%20(mathematics).md)_ of the vector __a__}@} is denoted by {@{‖<!-- markdown separator -->__a__<!-- markdown separator -->‖}@} or, {@{less commonly, \|__a__\|}@}, which is {@{not to be confused with the [absolute value](absolute%20value.md) \(a scalar "norm"\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-07,379,359!2026-06-15,386,359!2026-05-15,356,359!2029-04-10,1182,352-->

The length of the vector __a__ can be computed with {@{the _[Euclidean norm](Euclidean%20norm.md#Euclidean%20norm)_}@}, {@{$$\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|={\sqrt {a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+a_{3}^{2} } },$$}@} which is {@{a consequence of the [Pythagorean theorem](Pythagorean%20theorem.md)}@} since {@{the basis vectors __e__<sub>1</sub>, __e__<sub>2</sub>, __e__<sub>3</sub> are orthogonal unit vectors}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-16,387,359!2029-07-01,1247,352!2029-04-19,1188,352!2026-03-15,300,332-->

This happens to be equal to {@{the square root of the [dot product](dot%20product.md), discussed below, of the vector with itself}@}: {@{$$\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|={\sqrt {\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {a} } }.$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-05-07,353,352!2026-06-19,390,359-->

- Main article: [Unit vector](unit%20vector.md)

{@{A _unit vector_}@} is {@{any vector with a length of one}@}; normally unit vectors are used {@{simply to indicate direction}@}. {@{A vector of arbitrary length}@} can be {@{divided by its length to create a unit vector}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> This is known as {@{_normalizing_ a vector}@}. A unit vector is often indicated with {@{a hat as in __â__}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-29,1198,352!2026-06-13,384,359!2026-05-10,354,352!2026-06-14,385,359!2026-04-30,346,352!2029-08-31,1296,352!2029-04-24,1193,352-->

That is: {@{$$\mathbf {\hat {a} } ={\frac {\mathbf {a} }{\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|} }={\frac {a_{1} }{\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|} }\mathbf {e} _{1}+{\frac {a_{2} }{\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|} }\mathbf {e} _{2}+{\frac {a_{3} }{\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|} }\mathbf {e} _{3}$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-03-16,296,332!2026-06-17,388,359!2026-06-12,384,359-->

#### zero vector

- Main article: [Zero vector](zero%20vector.md#additive%20identities)

{@{The _zero vector_}@} is {@{the vector with length zero}@}. Written out in coordinates, the vector is {@{\(0, 0, 0\)}@}, and it is commonly denoted {@{${\vec {0} }$, __0__, or simply 0}@}. Unlike {@{any other vector}@}, it has {@{an arbitrary or indeterminate direction, and cannot be normalized}@} \(that is, there is {@{no unit vector that is a multiple of the zero vector}@}\). {@{The sum of the zero vector with any vector __a__ is __a__}@} \(that is, {@{__0__ + __a__ = __a__}@}\). <!--SR:!2026-03-14,299,332!2026-05-06,352,352!2029-08-11,1279,352!2029-04-13,1185,352!2026-05-19,363,359!2026-03-10,295,332!2026-03-15,295,332!2026-05-26,367,359!2026-06-01,373,359-->

### dot product

- Main article: [Dot product](dot%20product.md)

{@{The _dot product_ of two vectors __a__ and __b__}@} \(sometimes called {@{the _[inner product](inner%20product%20space.md)_}@}, or, since {@{its result is a scalar, the _scalar product_}@}\) is denoted by {@{__a__ ∙ __b,__}@} and is defined as: {@{$$\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {b} =\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|\left\|\mathbf {b} \right\|\cos \theta ,$$}@} where {@{_θ_ is the measure of the [angle](angle.md) between __a__ and __b__}@} \(see {@{[trigonometric function](trigonometric%20function.md) for an explanation of cosine}@}\). Geometrically, this means that {@{__a__ and __b__ are drawn with a common start point}@}, and then {@{the length of __a__ is multiplied with the length of the component of __b__ that points in the same direction as __a__}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-23,334,352!2029-08-29,1293,352!2026-05-25,366,359!2026-05-25,366,359!2026-06-04,376,359!2026-06-16,387,359!2026-06-17,388,359!2026-05-13,354,352!2026-03-03,288,332-->

The dot product can also be defined as {@{the sum of the products of the components of each vector}@} as {@{$$\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {b} =a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}+a_{3}b_{3}.$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-06-04,376,359!2026-06-08,379,359-->

### cross product

- Main article: [Cross product](cross%20product.md)

{@{The _cross product_ \(also called the _vector product_ or _outer product_\)}@} is {@{only meaningful in three or [seven](seven-dimensional%20cross%20product.md) dimensions}@}. The cross product differs from the dot product primarily in that {@{the result of the cross product of two vectors is a vector}@}. The cross product, denoted {@{__a__ × __b__}@}, is {@{a vector perpendicular to both __a__ and __b__}@} and is defined as {@{$$\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {b} =\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|\left\|\mathbf {b} \right\|\sin(\theta )\,\mathbf {n}$$}@} where {@{_θ_ is the measure of the angle between __a__ and __b__}@}, and {@{__n__ is a unit vector [perpendicular](perpendicular.md) to both __a__ and __b__ which completes a [right-handed](right-hand%20rule.md) system}@}. {@{The right-handedness constraint is necessary}@} because {@{there exist _two_ unit vectors that are perpendicular to both __a__ and __b__}@}, namely, {@{__n__ and \(−<!-- markdown separator -->__n__\)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-06-12,1234,352!2029-07-31,1273,352!2029-08-27,1292,352!2029-08-02,1271,352!2026-06-05,377,359!2026-06-11,382,359!2029-09-21,1311,352!2026-05-03,349,352!2029-06-07,1225,352!2026-05-09,350,352!2029-04-05,1177,352-->

The cross product __a__ × __b__ is defined so that {@{__a__, __b__, and __a__ × __b__ also becomes a right-handed system}@} \(although {@{__a__ and __b__ are not necessarily [orthogonal](orthogonal.md)}@}\). This is {@{the [right-hand rule](right-hand%20rule.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-03-25,859,332!2026-06-17,388,359!2026-05-06,347,352-->

{@{The length of __a__ × __b__}@} can be interpreted as {@{the area of the parallelogram having __a__ and __b__ as sides}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-01,347,352!2026-06-17,388,359-->

The cross product can be written as {@{$${\mathbf {a} }\times {\mathbf {b} }=(a_{2}b_{3}-a_{3}b_{2}){\mathbf {e} }_{1}+(a_{3}b_{1}-a_{1}b_{3}){\mathbf {e} }_{2}+(a_{1}b_{2}-a_{2}b_{1}){\mathbf {e} }_{3}.$$}@} <!--SR:!2027-07-14,678,339-->

For {@{arbitrary choices of spatial orientation \(that is, allowing for left-handed as well as right-handed coordinate systems\)}@} the cross product of two vectors is {@{a [pseudovector](pseudovector.md) instead of a vector \(see below\)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-08-01,1274,352!2026-03-19,299,332-->

### scalar triple product

- Main article: [Scalar triple product](triple%20product.md#scalar%20triple%20product)

{@{The _scalar triple product_ \(also called the _box product_ or _mixed triple product_\)}@} is {@{not really a new operator}@}, but {@{a way of applying the other two multiplication operators to three vectors}@}. The scalar triple product is sometimes denoted by {@{\(__a__ __b__ __c__\)}@} and defined as: {@{$$(\mathbf {a} \ \mathbf {b} \ \mathbf {c} )=\mathbf {a} \cdot (\mathbf {b} \times \mathbf {c} ).$$}@} <!--SR:!2029-08-18,1284,352!2026-05-03,349,352!2029-08-17,1283,352!2026-05-28,370,359!2026-05-06,347,352-->

It has {@{three primary uses}@}. First, {@{the absolute value of the box product}@} is {@{the volume of the [parallelepiped](parallelepiped.md) which has edges that are defined by the three vectors}@}. Second, the scalar triple product is {@{zero if and only if the three vectors are [linearly dependent](linear%20independence.md)}@}, which can be easily proved by {@{considering that in order for the three vectors to not make a volume, they must all lie in the same plane}@}. Third, the box product is {@{positive if and only if the three vectors __a__, __b__ and __c__ are right-handed}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-09,350,352!2029-08-22,1287,352!2026-05-15,357,359!2029-08-05,1277,352!2026-06-17,387,359!2026-04-09,325,352-->

In {@{components \(_with respect to a right-handed orthonormal basis_\)}@}, if {@{the three vectors are thought of as rows \(or columns, but in the same order\)}@}, the scalar triple product is {@{simply the [determinant](determinant.md) of the 3-by-3 [matrix](matrix%20(mathematics).md) having the three vectors as rows}@} {@{$$(\mathbf {a} \ \mathbf {b} \ \mathbf {c} )={\begin{vmatrix}a_{1}&a_{2}&a_{3}\\b_{1}&b_{2}&b_{3}\\c_{1}&c_{2}&c_{3}\\\end{vmatrix} }$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-03-11,296,332!2029-09-25,1314,352!2026-06-03,374,359!2028-07-10,975,359-->

The scalar triple product is {@{linear in all three entries and anti-symmetric}@} in the following sense: {@{$$(\mathbf {a} \ \mathbf {b} \ \mathbf {c} )=(\mathbf {c} \ \mathbf {a} \ \mathbf {b} )=(\mathbf {b} \ \mathbf {c} \ \mathbf {a} )=-(\mathbf {a} \ \mathbf {c} \ \mathbf {b} )=-(\mathbf {b} \ \mathbf {a} \ \mathbf {c} )=-(\mathbf {c} \ \mathbf {b} \ \mathbf {a} ).$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-05-29,370,359!2026-05-06,347,352-->

### conversion between multiple Cartesian bases

All examples thus far have {@{dealt with vectors expressed in terms of the same basis}@}, namely, {@{the _e_ basis {__e__<sub>1</sub>, __e__<sub>2</sub>, __e__<sub>3</sub>}<!-- markdown separator -->}@}. However, a vector can be {@{expressed in terms of any number of different bases that are not necessarily aligned with each other}@}, and {@{still remain the same vector}@}. In the _e_ basis, {@{a vector __a__ is expressed}@}, by definition, as {@{$$\mathbf {a} =p\mathbf {e} _{1}+q\mathbf {e} _{2}+r\mathbf {e} _{3}.$$}@} {@{The scalar components in the _e_ basis}@} are, by definition, {@{$${\begin{aligned}p&=\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {e} _{1},\\q&=\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {e} _{2},\\r&=\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {e} _{3}.\end{aligned} }$$}@} In {@{another orthonormal basis _n_ = {__n__<sub>1</sub>, __n__<sub>2</sub>, __n__<sub>3</sub>} that is not necessarily aligned with _e_}@}, the vector __a__ is expressed as {@{$$\mathbf {a} =u\mathbf {n} _{1}+v\mathbf {n} _{2}+w\mathbf {n} _{3}$$}@} and {@{the scalar components in the _n_ basis}@} are, by definition, {@{$${\begin{aligned}u&=\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {n} _{1},\\v&=\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {n} _{2},\\w&=\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {n} _{3}.\end{aligned} }$$}@} {@{The values of _p_, _q_, _r_, and _u_, _v_, _w_ relate to the unit vectors}@} in such a way that {@{the resulting vector sum is exactly the same physical vector __a__ in both cases}@}. It is common to {@{encounter vectors known in terms of different bases}@} \(for example, {@{one basis fixed to the Earth and a second basis fixed to a moving vehicle}@}\).

## vectors, pseudovectors, and transformations

{@{An alternative characterization}@} of Euclidean vectors, especially in {@{physics}@}, describes them as {@{lists of quantities which behave in a certain way under a [coordinate transformation](coordinate%20system.md)}@}. {@{A _contravariant vector_}@} is required to {@{have components that "transform opposite to the basis" under changes of [basis](basis%20(linear%20algebra).md)}@}. The vector itself {@{does not change when the basis is transformed}@}; instead, {@{the components of the vector make a change that cancels the change in the basis}@}. In other words, if {@{the reference axes \(and the basis derived from it\) were rotated in one direction}@}, {@{the component representation of the vector}@} would {@{rotate in the opposite way to generate the same final vector}@}. Similarly, if {@{the reference axes were stretched in one direction}@}, {@{the components of the vector would reduce in an exactly compensating way}@}. Mathematically, if {@{the basis undergoes a transformation described by an [invertible matrix](invertible%20matrix.md) _M_}@}, so that {@{a coordinate vector __x__ is transformed to __x__<!-- markdown separator -->′ = _M_<!-- markdown separator -->__x__}@}, then {@{a contravariant vector __v__}@} must be {@{similarly transformed via __v__<!-- markdown separator -->′ = _M_<sup>−1</sup>__v__}@}. This important requirement is {@{what distinguishes a contravariant vector from any other triple of physically meaningful quantities}@}. For example, if {@{_v_ consists of the _x_, _y_, and _z_-components of [velocity](velocity.md)}@}, then {@{_v_ is a contravariant vector}@}: if {@{the coordinates of space are stretched, rotated, or twisted}@}, then {@{the components of the velocity transform in the <!-- same -->opposite way}@}. On the other hand, for instance, {@{a triple consisting of the length, width, and height of a rectangular box}@} could {@{make up the three components of an abstract [vector](vector%20space.md)}@}, but {@{this vector would not be contravariant}@}, since {@{rotating the box does not change the box's length, width, and height}@}. Examples of contravariant vectors include {@{[displacement](displacement%20(vector).md), [velocity](velocity.md), [electric field](electric%20field.md), [momentum](momentum.md), [force](force.md), and [acceleration](acceleration.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-02,373,359!2029-06-08,1230,352!2026-03-10,295,332!2026-05-05,346,352!2026-05-14,355,352!2029-08-07,1276,352!2026-05-24,365,359!2026-05-09,355,352!2026-03-10,295,332!2026-05-29,370,359!2026-03-12,297,332!2026-06-04,376,359!2026-06-10,382,359!2026-05-26,368,359!2026-03-11,296,332!2026-05-24,365,359!2026-06-13,384,359!2029-10-04,1313,352!2026-03-14,299,332!2026-05-19,360,359!2029-01-21,1103,352!2029-08-02,1275,352!2026-03-12,297,332!2026-04-09,320,352!2026-05-07,351,352!2026-06-06,342,292-->

In {@{the language of [differential geometry](differential%20geometry.md)}@}, the requirement that {@{the components of a vector transform according to the same matrix of the coordinate transition}@} is equivalent to defining a _contravariant vector_ to be {@{a [tensor](tensor.md) of [contravariant](covariance%20and%20contravariance%20of%20vectors.md) rank one}@}. Alternatively, a contravariant vector is defined to be {@{a [tangent vector](tangent%20space.md)}@}, and {@{the rules for transforming a contravariant vector}@} {@{follow from the [chain rule](chain%20rule.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-07,1325,352!2026-06-12,383,359!2026-03-10,295,332!2026-04-16,332,352!2026-04-30,346,352!2029-09-23,1313,352-->

{@{Some vectors transform like contravariant vectors}@}, except that {@{when they are reflected through a mirror}@}, they {@{flip and gain a minus sign}@}. {@{A transformation that switches right-handedness to left-handedness and vice versa like a mirror does}@} is said to {@{change the _[orientation](orientation%20(space).md)_ of space}@}. {@{A vector which gains a minus sign when the orientation of space changes}@} is called {@{a _[pseudovector](pseudovector.md)_ or an _axial vector_}@}. {@{Ordinary vectors}@} are sometimes called {@{_true vectors_ or _polar vectors_}@} to {@{distinguish them from pseudovectors}@}. Pseudovectors occur most frequently as {@{the [cross product](cross%20product.md) of two ordinary vectors}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-11,296,332!2029-09-05,1298,352!2026-05-13,354,352!2026-03-07,292,332!2026-05-06,350,352!2026-03-14,294,332!2029-07-12,1258,352!2029-10-01,1320,352!2026-06-15,386,359!2026-03-11,296,332!2029-06-03,1225,352-->

One example of a pseudovector is {@{[angular velocity](angular%20velocity.md)}@}.
