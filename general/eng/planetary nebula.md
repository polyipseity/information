# planetary nebula

A __planetary nebula__ is {@{a type of [emission nebula](emission%20nebula.md) consisting of an expanding, glowing shell of [ionized](ionization.md) gas ejected from [red giant](red%20giant.md) stars late in their lives}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-19,333,290-->

The term "planetary nebula" is {@{a [misnomer](misnomer.md) because they are unrelated to [planets](planet.md)}@}. The term originates {@{from the planet-like round shape of these [nebulae](nebula.md) observed by astronomers through early telescopes}@}. <!--SR:!2027-11-23,918,330!2025-06-26,254,330-->
