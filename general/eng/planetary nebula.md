{@{A __planetary nebula__}@} is {@{a type of [emission nebula](emission%20nebula.md) consisting of an expanding, glowing shell of [ionized](ionization.md) gas}@} ejected from {@{[red giant](red%20giant.md) stars late in their lives}@}. <!--SR:!2029-08-22,1342,310!2026-01-21,17,314!2026-01-21,17,314-->

{@{The term "planetary nebula"}@} is {@{a [misnomer](misnomer.md) because they are unrelated to [planets](planet.md)}@}.
