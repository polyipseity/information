# interchange of limit operations

## list of related theorems

- interchange of [derivative](derivative.md) and [limit](limit%20of%20a%20function.md) ::@:: If a sequence of functions $(f_n)$ converges at at least one point and the sequence of their derivatives $(f_n')$ converges uniformly, then $(f_n)$ converges uniformly to its limiting function $f$ and $(f_n')$ converges (uniformly, as given above) to its limiting derivative $f'$. This can be shown using the [mean value theorem](mean%20value%20theorem.md) for [real-valued functions](real-valued%20function.md) or the [mean value inequality](mean%20value%20theorem.md#mean%20value%20theorem%20for%20vector-valued%20functions) for vector-valued functions. <!--SR:!2025-01-19,117,250!2025-02-22,168,310-->
- interchange of [derivative](derivative.md) and [integral](integral.md) ::@:: [Leibniz integral rule](Leibniz%20integral%20rule.md) <!--SR:!2025-05-15,235,330!2025-04-07,205,330-->
