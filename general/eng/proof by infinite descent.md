# proof by infinite descent

In [mathematics](mathematics.md), a proof by __infinite descent__, also known as {@{__Fermat's method of descent__}@}, is {@{a particular kind of [proof by contradiction](proof%20by%20contradiction.md) used to show that a statement cannot possibly hold for any number, by showing that if the statement were to hold for a number, then the same would be true for a smaller number, leading to an infinite descent and ultimately a contradiction}@}. It is a method which relies on {@{the [well-ordering principle](well-ordering%20principle.md), and is often used to show that a given equation, such as a [Diophantine equation](diophantine%20equation.md), has no solutions}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-18,1118,350!2027-09-01,824,330!2026-10-10,579,330-->

Typically, one shows that if {@{a solution to a problem existed, which in some sense was related to one or more [natural numbers](natural%20number.md)}@}, it would necessarily imply that {@{a second solution existed, which was related to one or more 'smaller' natural numbers}@}. This in turn would {@{imply a third solution related to smaller natural numbers, implying a fourth solution, therefore a fifth solution, and so on}@}. However, there {@{cannot be an infinity of ever-smaller natural numbers}@}, and therefore by {@{[mathematical induction](mathematical%20induction.md)}@}, the original premise—that {@{any solution exists—is incorrect: its correctness produces a [contradiction](contradiction.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-05-24,752,330!2027-05-07,737,330!2028-08-31,1127,350!2029-02-11,1256,350!2029-06-25,1361,350!2028-10-29,1174,350-->

An alternative way to express this is to {@{assume one or more solutions or examples exists, from which a smallest solution or example—a [minimal counterexample](minimal%20counterexample.md)—can then be inferred}@}. Once there, one would try to {@{prove that if a smallest solution exists, then it must imply the existence of a smaller solution (in some sense), which again proves that the existence of any solution would lead to a contradiction}@}. <!--SR:!2026-09-28,570,330!2026-05-22,462,310-->

{@{The earliest uses}@} of the method of infinite descent appear in {@{[Euclid's _Elements_](Euclid's%20Elements.md)}@}. A typical example is {@{Proposition 31 of Book 7}@}, in which {@{[Euclid](Euclid.md) proves that every composite integer is divided \(in Euclid's terminology "measured"\) by some prime number}@}. <!--SR:!2028-09-21,1144,350!2027-08-11,674,270!2025-09-25,4,321!2025-09-25,4,321-->

The method was much later developed by {@{[Fermat](Pierre%20de%20Fermat.md), who coined the term and often used it for [Diophantine equations](diophantine%20equation.md)}@}. Two typical examples are {@{showing the non-solvability of the Diophantine equation $r^{2}+s^{4}=t^{4}$}@} and {@{proving [Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares](Fermat's%20theorem%20on%20sums%20of%20two%20squares.md), which states that an odd prime _p_ can be expressed as a sum of two [squares](square%20number.md) when $p\equiv 1{\pmod {4} }$ (see [modular arithmetic](modular%20arithmetic.md) and [proof by infinite descent](Fermat's%20theorem%20on%20sums%20of%20two%20squares.md#euler.27s%20proof%20by%20infinite%20descent))}@}. In this way Fermat was able to {@{show the non-existence of solutions in many cases of Diophantine equations of classical interest (for example, the problem of four perfect squares in [arithmetic progression](arithmetic%20progression.md))}@}. <!--SR:!2027-02-24,682,330!2026-05-10,351,270!2026-03-07,269,250!2026-01-11,318,270-->

In some cases, to the modern eye, his "method of infinite descent" is {@{an exploitation of the [inversion](inversive%20geometry.md) of the doubling function for [rational points](rational%20point.md) on an [elliptic curve](elliptic%20curve.md) _E_}@}. The context is {@{of a hypothetical non-trivial rational point on _E_}@}. Doubling a point on _E_ roughly {@{doubles the length of the numbers required to write it (as number of digits)}@}, so that {@{"halving" a point gives a rational with smaller terms. Since the terms are positive, they cannot decrease forever}@}. <!--SR:!2028-03-10,916,330!2027-01-22,606,290!2027-01-20,653,330!2026-05-04,449,310-->
