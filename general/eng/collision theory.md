# collision theory

__Collision theory__ is {@{a [chemistry](chemistry.md) principle to predict [reaction rates](reaction%20rate.md)}@}. It states that when {@{[reactant](reagent.md) particles collide at the right orientation}@} with {@{sufficient energy, known as [activation energy](activation%20energy.md)}@}, {@{_effective collision_ occurs, resulting in products}@}.
