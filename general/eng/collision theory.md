# collision theory

__Collision theory__ is {@{a [chemistry](chemistry.md) principle to predict [reaction rates](reaction%20rate.md)}@}. It states that {@{when [reactant](reagent.md) particles collide at the right orientation with sufficient energy, known as [activation energy](activation%20energy.md), _effective collision_ occurs, resulting in products}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-09,492,310!2025-12-27,635,272-->
