# collision theory

__Collision theory__ is {@{a [chemistry](chemistry.md) principle to predict [reaction rates](reaction%20rate.md)}@}. It states that when {@{[reactant](reagent.md) particles collide at the right orientation}@} with {@{sufficient energy, known as [activation energy](activation%20energy.md)}@}, {@{_effective collision_ occurs, resulting in products}@}. <!--SR:!2030-11-21,2111,330!2030-09-25,1725,272!2026-04-22,71,321!2026-04-25,74,321-->
