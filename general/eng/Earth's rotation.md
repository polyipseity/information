# Earth's rotation

__Earth's rotation__ or __Earth's spin__ is {@{the [rotation](rotation.md) of planet [Earth](Earth.md) around its own [axis](rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md), as well as changes in the [orientation](orientation%20(geometry).md) of the rotation axis in space}@}. Earth rotates {@{[eastward](east.md), in [prograde motion](retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md)}@}, with an [axial tilt](axial%20tilt.md) of {@{23.4392811°}@}. As viewed from {@{the [northern polar star](pole%20star.md) [Polaris](Polaris.md), Earth turns [counterclockwise](clockwise.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-11-10,1242,350!2027-12-27,992,350!2026-01-02,223,170!2028-09-02,1188,350-->

Earth rotates once {@{in about 24 hours with respect to the [Sun](Sun.md) (synodic/stellar), but once about every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to other distant [stars](star.md) (sidereal; [see below](#stellar%20and%20sidereal%20day))}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-15,568,310-->
