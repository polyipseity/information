In {@{[variance analysis \(accounting\)](variance%20analysis%20(accounting).md)}@} {@{__direct material total variance__}@} is {@{the difference between the [actual cost](actual%20cost.md) of [actual number](actual%20number.md) of units produced}@} and {@{its budgeted cost in terms of material}@}. {@{Direct material total variance}@} can be {@{divided into two components}@}: \(annotation: 2 items: {@{direct material price variance, direct material usage variance}@}\)

- the [direct material price variance](direct%20material%20price%20variance.md),
- the [direct material usage variance](direct%20material%20usage%20variance.md).

## example

Let us assume that {@{standard direct material cost of [widget](widget%20(economics).md)}@} is as follows: <p> &emsp; {@{2 kg}@} of [unobtainium](unobtainium.md) at {@{\$ 60 per kg}@} \( = {@{\$ 120 per unit}@}\).

Let us assume further that during the given period, {@{100 widgets were manufactured}@}, using {@{212 kg of [unobtainium](unobtainium.md) which cost \$ 13,144}@}.

Under those assumptions direct material total variance can be calculated as:

|                                                        |     |                                 |                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --- | ------------------------------: | --------------- |
| {@{100 units should have cost \(× \$ 120 per unit\)}@} |     |                  {@{€ 12,000}@} |                 |
| &emsp; {@{but did cost}@}                              |     |           {@{<u>€ 13,144</u>}@} |                 |
| {@{Direct material total variance}@}                   |     | {@{__<u><u>€ 1,144</u></u>__}@} | {@{__\(A\)__}@} |

Direct material total variance can be reconciled to {@{[direct material price variance](direct%20material%20price%20variance.md) and [direct material usage variance](direct%20material%20usage%20variance.md)}@} by:

|                                      |     |                             |             |
| ------------------------------------ | --- | --------------------------: | ----------- |
| {@{Direct material usage variance}@} |     |                 {@{€ 720}@} | {@{\(A\)}@} |
| {@{Direct material price variance}@} |     |          {@{<u>€ 424</u>}@} | {@{\(A\)}@} |
| {@{Direct material total variance}@} |     | {@{<u><u>€ 1,144</u></u>}@} | {@{\(A\)}@} |

See {@{[direct material usage variance\#Example](direct%20material%20usage%20variance.md#example) and [direct material price variance\#Example](direct%20material%20price%20variance.md#example)}@} for {@{computations of both components}@}.
