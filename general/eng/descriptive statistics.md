# descriptive statistics

A __descriptive statistic__ (in the [count noun](count%20noun.md) sense) is {@{a [summary statistic](summary%20statistics.md) that quantitatively describes or summarizes features from a collection of [information](information.md)}@}, while __descriptive statistics__ (in the [mass noun](mass%20noun.md) sense) is {@{the process of using and analysing those statistics}@}. Descriptive statistics is distinguished from {@{[inferential statistics](statistical%20inference.md) (or inductive statistics) by its aim to summarize a [sample](sampling%20(statistics).md), rather than use the data to learn about the [population](statistical%20population.md) that the sample of data is thought to represent}@}. This generally means that descriptive statistics, {@{unlike inferential statistics, is not developed on the basis of [probability theory](probability%20theory.md), and are frequently [nonparametric statistics](nonparametric%20statistics.md)}@}. Even when a data analysis {@{draws its main conclusions using inferential statistics}@}, {@{descriptive statistics are generally also presented}@}. For example, in papers reporting on human subjects, typically {@{a table is included giving the overall [sample size](sample%20size%20determination.md), sample sizes in important subgroups (e.g., for each treatment or exposure group)}@}, and {@{[demographic](demography.md) or clinical characteristics such as the [average](average.md) age, the proportion of subjects of each sex, the proportion of subjects with related [co-morbidities](comorbidity.md), etc.}@} <!--SR:!2027-12-20,918,330!2027-07-03,777,330!2025-07-18,227,310!2027-08-05,754,290!2025-09-13,254,290!2028-05-15,1051,350!2026-05-06,456,310!2025-12-15,312,290-->

Some measures that are commonly used to describe a data set are {@{measures of [central tendency](central%20tendency.md) and measures of variability or [dispersion](statistical%20dispersion.md)}@}. Measures of central tendency include {@{the [mean](mean.md), [median](median.md) and [mode](mode%20(statistics).md)}@}, while measures of variability include {@{the [standard deviation](standard%20deviation.md) (or [variance](variance.md)), the minimum and maximum values of the variables, [kurtosis](kurtosis.md) and [skewness](skewness.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-05-22,1056,350!2028-07-06,1091,350!2026-09-27,551,310-->
