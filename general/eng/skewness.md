# skewness

In [probability theory](probability%20theory.md) and [statistics](statistics.md), __skewness__ is {@{a measure of the asymmetry of the [probability distribution](probability%20distribution.md) of a [real](real%20number.md)-valued [random variable](random%20variable.md) about its mean}@}. The skewness value can be {@{positive, zero, negative, or undefined}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-30,1135,350!2029-09-23,1438,350-->

For {@{a [unimodal](unimodality.md) distribution (a distribution with a single peak)}@}, negative skew {@{_commonly_ indicates that the _tail_ is on the left side of the distribution, and positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right}@}. In cases {@{where one tail is long but the other tail is fat}@}, skewness {@{does not obey a simple rule}@}. For example, a zero value in skewness means that {@{the tails on both sides of the mean balance out _overall_}@}; this is the case for {@{a symmetric distribution but can also be true for an asymmetric distribution where one tail is long and thin, and the other is short but fat}@}. Thus, {@{the judgement on the symmetry of a given distribution by using only its skewness}@} is {@{risky; the distribution shape must be taken into account}@}. <!--SR:!2028-05-14,1052,350!2027-06-21,780,330!2028-10-03,1161,350!2027-03-10,702,330!2028-08-06,1117,350!2028-10-25,1179,350!2028-05-04,1042,350!2026-12-09,629,330-->

## relationship of mean and median

The skewness is {@{not directly related to the relationship between the mean and median}@}: {@{a distribution with negative skew can have its mean greater than or less than the median}@}, and {@{likewise for positive skew}@}. <!--SR:!2029-01-04,1232,350!2027-11-23,775,342!2026-02-09,102,382-->

In {@{the older notion of [nonparametric skew](nonparametric%20skew.md)}@}, defined as {@{$(\mu -\nu )/\sigma ,$ where $\mu$ is the [mean](mean.md), $\nu$ is the [median](median.md), and $\sigma$ is the [standard deviation](standard%20deviation.md)}@}, the skewness is {@{defined in terms of this relationship: positive/right nonparametric skew means the mean is greater than (to the right of) the median, while negative/left nonparametric skew means the mean is less than (to the left of) the median}@}. However, {@{the modern definition of skewness and the traditional nonparametric definition}@} {@{do not always have the same sign}@}: while they {@{agree for some families of distributions}@}, they {@{differ in some of the cases, and conflating them is misleading}@}. <!--SR:!2029-08-25,1416,350!2028-11-24,1201,350!2025-12-10,347,310!2027-05-23,746,330!2028-09-06,1003,367!2025-12-07,4,344!2025-12-07,4,344-->

If {@{the distribution is [symmetric](symmetric%20probability%20distribution.md)}@}, then {@{the mean is equal to the median, and the distribution has zero skewness}@}. If {@{the distribution is both symmetric and [unimodal](unimodality.md#unimodal%20probability%20distribution)}@}, then {@{the [mean](mean.md) = [median](median.md) = [mode](mode%20(statistics).md)}@}. This is the case of {@{a coin toss or the series 1,2,3,4,...}@} Note, however, that {@{the converse is not true in general, i.e. zero skewness (defined below) does not imply that the mean is equal to the median}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-09,1119,350!2029-06-06,1352,350!2028-06-02,1067,350!2029-08-13,1405,350!2029-02-20,1269,350!2028-04-11,1024,350-->
