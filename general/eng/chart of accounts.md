# chart of accounts

{@{A __chart of accounts__ \(__COA__\)}@} is {@{a list of financial [accounts](account%20(bookkeeping).md) and reference numbers, grouped into categories}@}, such as {@{assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses}@}, and used for {@{recording transactions in the organization's [general ledger](general%20ledger.md)}@}. {@{Accounts}@} may be associated with {@{an identifier \(account number\) and a caption or header}@} and are {@{coded by account type}@}. In {@{computerized [accounting systems](accounting%20software.md) with computable quantity accounting}@}, the accounts can {@{have a quantity measure definition}@}. {@{Account numbers}@} may consist of {@{numerical, alphabetic, or [alpha-numeric](alphanumericals.md) characters}@}, although in {@{many computerized environments, like the [SIE format](SIE%20(file%20format).md)}@}, {@{only numerical identifiers are allowed}@}. {@{The structure and headings of accounts}@} should assist in {@{consistent posting of transactions}@}. {@{Each nominal ledger account}@} is {@{unique, which allows its [ledger](ledger.md) to be located}@}. The accounts are typically arranged in {@{the order of the customary appearance of accounts in the financial statements}@}: {@{balance sheet accounts followed by profit and loss accounts}@}. <!--SR:!2029-02-11,1249,350!2027-09-20,705,270!2029-02-15,1252,350!2029-03-22,1280,350!2029-05-17,1322,350!2028-01-13,911,330!2026-04-06,386,290!2027-05-17,741,330!2028-05-28,1046,350!2028-02-19,965,350!2027-12-20,890,330!2027-05-28,751,330-->

{@{The charts of accounts}@} can be picked from {@{a standard chart of accounts, like the BAS in Sweden}@}. In {@{some countries}@}, charts of accounts are {@{defined by the accountant from a standard general layouts or as regulated by law}@}. However, in {@{most countries}@} it is {@{entirely up to each accountant to design the chart of accounts}@}. <!--SR:!2029-04-19,1302,350!2027-09-23,824,330!2027-04-27,721,330-->
