# Arctic Circle

The __Arctic Circle__ is {@{the [circle of altitude](circle%20of%20altitude.md) marking the [southernmost](south.md) [latitude](latitude.md) at which the [Sun](Sun.md) is above the [horizon](horizon.md) for 24 continuous hours at least once per year}@}. The duration becomes longer {@{the [norther](north.md) one goes, reaching about 6 months at the [North Pole](North%20Pole.md)}@}. These are also true for the [southern](south.md) equivalent, {@{the [Antarctic Circle](Antarctic%20Circle.md)}@}.

The position of the Arctic Circle is {@{not fixed and currently runs about 66°33′50.0″ [north](north.md) of the [equator](equator.md)}@}. The value is {@{approximately 90 degrees minus the [Earth](Earth.md)'s [axial tilt](axial%20tilt.md)}@}.
