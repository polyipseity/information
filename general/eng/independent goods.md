> {@{Two goods that are independent have a zero cross price elasticity of demand}@}: {@{as the price of good Y rises, the demand for good X stays constant}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-22,264,330!2025-11-19,285,330!2025-11-17,284,330-->

__Independent goods__ are {@{[goods](goods.md) that have a zero [cross elasticity of demand](cross%20elasticity%20of%20demand.md)}@}. {@{Changes in the price of one good}@} will {@{have no effect on the [demand](demand.md) for an independent good}@}. Thus {@{independent goods}@} are {@{neither [complements](complementary%20good.md) nor [substitutes](substitute%20good.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-29,294,330!2025-11-20,286,330!2025-10-25,266,330!2025-11-03,274,330!2025-11-05,276,330-->

For example, a person's demand for nails is {@{usually independent of his or her demand for bread}@}, since {@{they are two unrelated types of goods}@}. Note that this concept is {@{subjective and depends on the consumer's personal [utility function](utility.md#functions)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-24,265,330!2025-11-15,282,330!2025-11-28,293,330-->

{@{A [Cobb-Douglas utility function](Cobbâ€“Douglas%20production%20function.md)}@} implies that {@{goods are independent}@}. For {@{goods in quantities _X_<sub>1</sub> and _X_<sub>2</sub>, prices _p_<sub>1</sub> and _p_<sub>2</sub>}@}, {@{income _m_, and utility function parameter _a_}@}, {@{the utility function $$u(X_{1},X_{2})=X_{1}^{a}X_{2}^{(1-a)},$$}@} when optimized {@{subject to the budget constraint that expenditure on the two goods cannot exceed income}@}, gives rise to {@{this demand function for good 1:<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> $X_{1}=am/p_{1},$}@} which {@{does not depend on _p_<sub>2</sub>}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-18,426,310!2025-11-21,287,330!2025-08-09,190,310!2025-11-16,283,330!2025-11-27,292,330!2025-04-25,112,290!2026-03-04,343,290!2025-07-24,189,310-->
