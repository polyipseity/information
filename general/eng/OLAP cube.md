# OLAP cube

{@{An __OLAP cube__}@} is {@{a [multi-dimensional array](array%20(data%20type).md#multi-dimensional%20arrays)}@}. OLAP refers to {@{[online analytical processing](online%20analytical%20processing.md)}@}, {@{a computer-based technique of analyzing data to look for insights}@}. The term _cube_ refers to {@{a multi-dimensional dataset, laid out in a multi-dimensional spreadsheet}@}. It is also sometimes called {@{a [hypercube](hypercube.md) if the number of dimensions is greater than 3}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-29,772,330!2028-07-03,970,290!2026-04-15,490,310!2026-11-12,668,330!2027-03-01,387,367!2027-02-28,386,367-->

## operations

{@{_Drill down/up_}@} allows the user to {@{navigate among levels of data}@} ranging from {@{the most summarized (up) to the most detailed (down)}@}. The more summarized the data level, {@{the more dimensions are collapsed and thus hidden}@}, and vice versa. <!--SR:!2028-08-31,1195,350!2027-08-14,865,330!2029-12-29,1472,310!2027-03-17,398,367-->

{@{_Rollup_}@} involves {@{summarizing the data along a dimension}@}. {@{The summarization rule}@} may be {@{an [aggregate function](aggregate%20function.md)}@}, such as {@{computing the average, max, min, sum, or a custom formula}@}. <!--SR:!2026-12-16,626,310!2030-12-18,1800,330!2026-06-02,525,310!2027-03-18,399,367!2027-03-02,388,367-->
