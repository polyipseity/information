# OLAP cube

An __OLAP cube__ is {@{a [multi-dimensional array](array%20(data%20type).md#multi-dimensional%20arrays)}@}. OLAP refers to {@{[online analytical processing](online%20analytical%20processing.md), a computer-based technique of analyzing data to look for insights}@}. The term _cube_ refers to {@{a multi-dimensional dataset, laid out in a multi-dimensional spreadsheet}@}. It is also sometimes called {@{a [hypercube](hypercube.md) if the number of dimensions is greater than 3}@}.

## operations

_Drill down/up_ allows the user to {@{navigate among levels of data}@} ranging from {@{the most summarized (up) to the most detailed (down)}@}. The more summarized the data level, {@{the more dimensions are collapsed and thus hidden}@}, and vice versa.

_Rollup_ involves {@{summarizing the data along a dimension}@}. The summarization rule may be {@{an [aggregate function](aggregate%20function.md)}@}, such as {@{computing the average, max, min, sum, or a custom formula}@}.
