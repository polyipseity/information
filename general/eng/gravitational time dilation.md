# gravitational time dilation

__Gravitational time dilation__ is {@{a form of [time dilation](time%20dilation.md), an actual difference of elapsed time between two [events](event%20(relativity).md), as measured by [observers](observer%20(special%20relativity).md) situated at varying distances from a gravitating [mass](mass.md)}@}. {@{The lower the [gravitational potential](gravitational%20potential.md) (the closer the clock is to the source of gravitation)}@}, {@{the slower time passes}@}, speeding up as {@{the gravitational potential increases (the clock moving away from the source of gravitation)}@}. [Albert Einstein](Albert%20Einstein.md) originally predicted this in {@{his [theory of relativity](theory%20of%20relativity.md), and it has since been confirmed by [tests of general relativity](tests%20of%20general%20relativity.md)}@}.
