# zero force member

In [engineering mechanics](applied%20mechanics.md), a __zero force member__ is {@{a member in a [truss](truss.md) which, given a specific [load](structural%20load.md), is neither in [tension](tension%20(physics).md) nor in [compression](compression%20(physics).md)}@}.

## description

Zero force members are found {@{at joints where three or fewer truss members meet}@}. Also, the joints {@{either have no external forces, or the external forces act in a manner similar to the members as described below}@}. Specifically, there are {@{2}@} situations:

- 2 truss members ::@:: If they are non-collinear and meet in an unloaded (or the load, when treated as a new truss member, acts in a similar manner) joint, they are both zero force members.
- 3 truss members ::@:: If they meet in an unloaded (or the load, when treated as a new truss member, acts in a similar manner) joint and two of them are collinear, then the non-collinear member is a zero force member.

The above can be proved {@{using [vectors](vector%20(mathematics%20and%20physics).md)}@}.
