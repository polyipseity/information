# Newton's laws of motion

__Newton's laws of motion__ are {@{three [physical laws](scientific%20law.md) that describe the relationship between the [motion](motion.md) of an object and the [forces](force.md) acting on it}@}. These laws, which provide {@{the basis for __Newtonian mechanics__}@}, can be paraphrased as follows:

1. [first law](#first%20law) ::@:: A body remains at rest, or in [motion](motion.md) at a constant [speed](speed.md) in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a [force](force.md).
2. [second law](#second%20law) ::@:: At any instant of [time](time.md), the [net force](net%20force.md) on a body is equal to the body's [acceleration](acceleration.md) multiplied by its [mass](mass.md) or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's [momentum](momentum.md) is changing with time.
3. [third law](#third%20law.md) ::@:: If two bodies exert [forces](force.md) on each other, these forces have the same [magnitude](magnitude%20(mathematics).md) but opposite directions.

## laws

### first law

{@{Newton's first law}@} expresses {@{the principle of [inertia](inertia.md)}@}: {@{the natural behavior of a body is to move in a straight line at constant [speed](speed.md)}@}.

### second law

In modern notation, the [momentum](momentum.md) of a body is {@{the product of its [mass](mass.md) and its [velocity](velocity.md): $$\mathbf p = m \mathbf v$$}@}, where all 3 quantities {@{can change over [time](time.md) $t$}@}. Newton's second law, in modern form, states that {@{the [derivative](derivative.md) of the momentum is the force: $$\mathbf F = \frac {\mathrm d \mathbf p} {\mathrm dt}$$}@}. If {@{mass $m$ does not change over time}@}, then {@{the derivative acts only on the velocity}@}, and so {@{the force equals the product of the mass and the time derivative of velocity, which is [acceleration](acceleration.md): $$\mathbf F = m \frac {\mathrm d \mathbf v} {\mathrm dt} = m \mathbf a$$}@}. As acceleration is also {@{the second time derivative of position}@}, the above equation can also be written as: {@{$$\mathbf F = m \frac {\mathrm d^2 \mathbf s} {\mathrm dt^2}$$}@}.

### third law

Newton's third law relates to {@{a more fundamental principle, the [conservation of momentum](momentum.md#conservation)}@}.
