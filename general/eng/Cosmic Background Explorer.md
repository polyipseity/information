# Cosmic Background Explorer

{@{The __Cosmic Background Explorer__ (__COBE__ /ˈkoʊbi/ _KOH-bee_)}@}, also referred to as {@{__Explorer 66__}@}, was {@{a [NASA](NASA.md) satellite dedicated to [cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md), which operated from 1989 to 1993}@}. Its goals were to {@{investigate the [cosmic microwave background radiation](cosmic%20microwave%20background.md) (CMB or CMBR) of the [universe](universe.md)}@} and {@{provide measurements that would help shape our understanding of the [cosmos](cosmos.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-02-03,686,330!2027-12-14,912,330!2028-11-04,998,250!2028-05-21,1024,310!2030-10-06,1696,330-->

COBE's measurements provided {@{two key pieces of evidence that supported the [Big Bang](Big%20Bang.md) theory of the universe}@}: that {@{the CMB has a near-perfect [black-body](black%20body.md) [spectrum](electromagnetic%20spectrum.md)}@}, and that {@{it has very faint [anisotropies](anisotropy.md)}@}. Two of COBE's principal investigators, {@{[George F. Smoot III](George%20Smoot.md) and [John C. Mather](John%20C.%20Mather.md)}@}, received {@{the [Nobel Prize in Physics](Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics.md) in 2006 for their work on the project}@}. According to the Nobel Prize committee, {@{"the COBE project can also be regarded as the starting point for [cosmology](cosmology.md) as a precision science"}@}. <!--SR:!2028-11-21,1209,350!2028-10-28,1191,350!2028-12-20,1232,350!2028-07-01,1052,310!2027-03-05,655,290!2028-11-04,1192,350-->

COBE was {@{the second cosmic microwave background satellite, following [RELIKT-1](RELIKT-1.md)}@}, and was followed by {@{two more advanced spacecraft}@}: {@{the [Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe](Wilkinson%20Microwave%20Anisotropy%20Probe.md) (WMAP) operated from 2001 to 2010}@} and {@{the [Planck spacecraft](Planck%20(spacecraft).md) from 2009 to 2013}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-10,592,270!2026-04-25,458,310!2027-07-03,679,250!2027-11-26,860,290-->
