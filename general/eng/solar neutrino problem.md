# solar neutrino problem

The __solar neutrino problem__ concerned {@{a large discrepancy between the flux of [solar neutrinos](solar%20neutrino.md) as predicted from the [Sun](Sun.md)'s [luminosity](luminosity.md) and as measured directly}@}. The discrepancy was {@{first observed in the mid-1960s and was resolved around 2002}@}. <!--SR:!2028-03-17,1028,350!2030-03-25,1507,310-->

When [neutrino detectors](neutrino%20detector.md) became {@{sensitive enough to measure the flow of [electron neutrinos](electron%20neutrino.md) from the [Sun](Sun.md)}@}, the number detected was {@{much lower than predicted. In various experiments, the number deficit was between one half and two thirds}@}. <!--SR:!2029-07-30,1428,350!2028-11-03,1210,350-->

## resolution

- see: ::@:: [Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect](Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein%20effect.md), [neutrino oscillation](neutrino%20oscillation.md) <!--SR:!2026-02-24,78,346!2026-02-24,78,346-->

{@{The solar neutrino problem}@} was resolved with {@{an improved understanding of the properties of neutrinos}@}. According to {@{the Standard Model of particle physics}@}, there are {@{three flavors of neutrinos}@}: {@{[_electron neutrinos_](electron%20neutrino.md), [_muon neutrinos_](muon%20neutrino.md), and [_tau neutrinos_](tau%20neutrino.md)}@}. {@{Electron neutrinos}@} are {@{the ones produced in the Sun and the ones detected by the above-mentioned experiments}@}, in particular {@{the chlorine-detector Homestake Mine experiment}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-03,841,330!2029-08-26,1378,310!2027-02-15,360,366!2026-03-03,84,346!2026-03-03,84,346!2027-02-12,357,366!2026-03-03,84,346!2026-02-25,79,346-->

Strong evidence for {@{[neutrino oscillation](neutrino%20oscillation.md) came in 1998}@} from the [Super-Kamiokande](Super-Kamiokande.md) collaboration in Japan. <!--SR:!2028-06-26,1029,290-->
