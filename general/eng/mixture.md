A __mixture__ is {@{a matter made up of multiple [chemical substances](chemical%20substance.md) which are not chemically bonded}@}. It is impure.

## properties

Compare with [chemical substance § properties](chemical%20substance.md#properties).

- composition ::@:: variable
- formation ::@:: no [chemical reactions](chemical%20reaction.md), no to little energy change ([enthalpy of mixing](enthalpy%20of%20mixing.md))
- properties ::@:: each constituent keeps its properties
- separation ::@:: separable by physical and chemical methods
- [boiling point](boiling%20point.md) and [melting point](melting%20point.md) ::@:: wide

## uniformity

A mixture is {@{either _[homogeneous](#homogeneous%20mixture)_ or _[heterogeneous](#heterogeneous%20mixture)_}@}.

### homogeneous mixture

A homogeneous mixture has {@{uniformly distributed constituents}@}.

### heterogeneous mixture
