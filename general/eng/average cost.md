In {@{[economics](economics.md)}@}, {@{__average cost__ \(__AC__\) or __unit cost__}@} is equal to {@{[total cost](total%20cost.md) \(TC\) divided by the number of units of a [good](goods.md) produced \(the [output](output%20(economics).md) Q\)}@}: {@{$$AC={\frac {TC}{Q} } \,.$$}@} <!--SR:!2030-04-10,1495,362!2030-03-24,1482,362!2028-10-12,1052,350!2026-05-13,129,403-->

{@{Short-run costs}@} are {@{those that vary with almost no time lagging}@}. {@{[Labor cost](labor%20market.md) and the cost of [raw materials](raw%20materials.md)}@} are short-run costs, but {@{[physical capital](physical%20capital.md) is not}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-17,1357,362!2029-11-07,1373,362!2029-10-19,1356,362!2029-12-21,1406,362-->

{@{An [average cost curve](cost%20curve.md)}@} can be plotted with {@{cost on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis}@}. {@{[Marginal costs](marginal%20costs.md)}@} are often {@{also shown on these graphs, with marginal cost representing the cost of the last unit produced at each point}@}; {@{marginal costs in the short run}@} are {@{the [slope](slope.md) of the [variable cost curve](total%20cost.md) \(and hence the [first derivative](first%20derivative.md) of variable cost\)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-01-13,1128,350!2029-12-08,1399,362!2028-06-09,946,342!2029-12-05,1397,362!2026-09-28,463,322!2026-03-29,335,342-->

{@{A typical average cost curve}@} has {@{a U-shape}@}, because {@{[fixed costs](fixed%20cost.md) are all incurred before any production takes place}@} and {@{marginal costs are typically increasing, because of [diminishing marginal productivity](diminishing%20returns.md)}@}. In this "typical" case, for {@{low levels of production marginal costs are below average costs}@}, so {@{average costs are decreasing as quantity increases}@}. An increasing marginal cost curve {@{intersects a U-shaped average cost curve at the latter's minimum}@}, after which {@{the average cost curve begins to slope upward}@}. For {@{further increases in production beyond this minimum}@}, {@{marginal cost is above average costs, so average costs are increasing as quantity increases}@}.

## long-run average cost

{@{Long-run average cost}@} is {@{the unit cost of producing a certain output when all inputs, even [physical capital](physical%20capital.md), are variable}@}. {@{The [behavioral assumption](behavioral%20assumption.md)}@} is that {@{the firm will choose that combination of inputs}@} that produce {@{the desired quantity at the lowest possible cost}@}. <!--SR:!2030-04-07,1493,362!2027-02-10,557,322!2028-01-30,789,330!2028-02-03,792,330!2026-05-13,129,403-->

{@{A long-run average cost curve}@} is typically {@{downward sloping at relatively low levels of output, and upward or downward sloping at relatively high levels of output}@}. Most commonly, {@{the long-run average cost curve is U-shaped}@}, by definition {@{reflecting economies of scale where negatively sloped and diseconomies of scale where positively sloped}@}. <!--SR:!2030-04-05,1491,362!2026-03-30,336,342!2029-11-18,1383,362!2026-03-30,336,342-->

If {@{the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets}@}, and thus {@{the per-unit prices of all its inputs are unaffected by how much of the inputs the firm purchases}@}, then it can be shown<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> that at {@{a particular level of output}@}, the firm has {@{[economies of scale](economies%20of%20scale.md) \(i.e., is operating in a downward sloping region of the long-run average cost curve\)}@} {@{if and only if it has increasing [returns to scale](returns%20to%20scale.md)}@}, the latter being {@{exclusively a feature of the [production function](production%20function.md)}@}. Likewise, it has {@{diseconomies of scale \(is operating in an upward sloping region of the long-run average cost curve\)}@} {@{if and only if it has decreasing returns to scale}@}, and has {@{neither economies nor diseconomies of scale}@} {@{if it has constant returns to scale}@}. With {@{[perfect competition](perfect%20competition.md) in the output market}@} {@{the long-run market equilibrium}@} will involve {@{all firms operating at the minimum point of their long-run average cost curves}@} \(i.e., at {@{the borderline between economies and diseconomies of scale}@}\). <!--SR:!2029-12-11,1401,362!2027-06-05,612,322!2028-03-28,832,330!2028-01-23,845,342!2030-01-20,1431,362!2028-02-01,853,342!2029-10-07,1347,362!2026-03-14,322,342!2027-07-14,506,355!2026-04-07,122,400!2026-06-21,140,407!2026-06-20,139,407!2026-06-22,141,407!2026-06-21,140,407-->

If, {@{however, the firm is not a perfect competitor in the input markets}@}, then {@{the above conclusions are modified}@}. For example, if {@{there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels}@}, but the firm is {@{so big in one or more input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input's per-unit cost}@}, then the firm could have {@{diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels}@}. Conversely, if the firm is {@{able to get bulk discounts of an input}@}, then it could have {@{economies of scale in some range of output levels even if it has decreasing returns in production in that output range}@}. <!--SR:!2029-02-11,1151,350!2029-01-19,1133,350!2028-01-07,834,342!2029-12-29,1416,362!2029-02-27,1165,350!2030-02-05,1443,362!2030-03-06,1467,362-->

In {@{some industries}@}, {@{long-run average cost}@} is {@{always declining \(economies of scale exist indefinitely\)}@}. This means that {@{the largest firm}@} tends to {@{have a cost advantage}@}, and the industry tends {@{naturally to become a [monopoly](monopoly.md)}@}, and hence is called {@{a [natural monopoly](natural%20monopoly.md)}@}. Natural monopolies tend to exist in {@{industries with high capital costs in relation to variable costs}@}, such as {@{water supply and electricity supply}@}. <!--SR:!2029-11-30,1393,362!2029-10-02,1346,362!2028-12-31,1118,350!2029-02-21,1160,350!2026-03-12,320,342!2027-07-30,706,342!2029-11-21,1386,362!2026-06-19,138,406!2026-06-18,137,406-->

When {@{average cost is declining as output increases}@}, {@{marginal cost is less than average cost}@}. When {@{average cost is rising, marginal cost is greater than average cost}@}. When {@{average cost is neither rising nor falling \(at a minimum or maximum\), marginal cost equals average cost}@}. <!--SR:!2030-04-02,1485,362!2026-03-18,324,342!2029-11-27,1391,362!2026-03-17,323,342-->

- {@{Constant marginal cost/high [fixed costs](fixed%20cost.md)}@}: {@{each additional [unit of production](unit%20of%20production.md) is produced at constant additional expense per unit}@}. {@{The average cost curve}@} {@{slopes down continuously, approaching marginal cost}@}. An example is {@{[hydroelectric](hydroelectric.md) generation}@}, which has {@{no fuel expense, limited maintenance expenses and a high up-front fixed cost \(ignoring irregular maintenance costs or useful lifespan\)}@}. {@{Industries with fixed marginal costs}@}, such as {@{electrical transmission networks}@}, may {@{meet the conditions for a [natural monopoly](natural%20monopoly.md)}@}, because {@{once capacity is built}@}, {@{the marginal cost to the incumbent of serving an additional customer}@} is {@{always lower than the average cost for a potential competitor}@}. {@{The high fixed capital costs}@} are {@{a [barrier to entry](barrier%20to%20entry.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-21,327,342!2030-01-13,1425,362!2028-12-29,1117,350!2027-09-05,735,342!2028-02-04,855,342!2026-07-31,420,322!2030-01-04,1419,362!2026-03-29,335,342!2030-03-14,1474,362!2028-07-17,965,342!2029-11-26,1390,362!2029-12-30,1417,362!2026-05-13,129,403!2026-05-13,129,403-->

- {@{Two popular pricing mechanisms}@} are {@{[average cost pricing](average%20cost%20pricing.md) \(or rate of return regulation\) and marginal cost pricing}@}. {@{A monopoly produces where its average cost curve meets the market demand curve under average cost pricing}@}, referred to as {@{the average cost pricing equilibrium}@}. <!--SR:!2029-12-12,1401,362!2029-05-27,1196,322!2026-03-26,332,342!2028-07-28,986,342-->

- {@{[Minimum efficient scale](minimum%20efficient%20scale.md)}@}: {@{Marginal or average costs may be nonlinear, or have discontinuities}@}. {@{Average cost curves}@} may {@{therefore only be shown over a limited scale of production for a given technology}@}. For example, {@{a nuclear plant}@} would be {@{extremely inefficient \(high average cost\) for production in small quantities}@}. Similarly, {@{its maximum output for any given time period}@} may {@{essentially be fixed}@}, and {@{production above that level}@} may be {@{technically impossible, dangerous or extremely costly}@}. {@{The long run [elasticity of supply](elasticity%20of%20supply.md) are higher}@}, as {@{new plants could be built and brought on-line}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-23,1360,362!2028-01-18,843,342!2029-10-16,1356,362!2026-03-11,319,342!2030-04-13,1498,362!2029-12-19,1407,362!2030-04-11,1496,362!2026-12-08,462,302!2027-10-08,755,330!2029-08-03,1294,362!2029-02-01,1144,350!2027-10-21,765,330-->

- {@{Zero fixed costs \(long-run analysis\) and constant marginal cost}@}: since {@{there are no [economies of scale](economies%20of%20scale.md)}@}, {@{average cost is equal to the constant marginal cost}@}. <!--SR:!2030-03-31,1487,362!2028-02-20,737,417!2028-01-30,718,417-->
