# ester

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../../tools/utility.py.md
```

## physical properties

### boiling and melting points

Due to increased [polarizability](polarizability.md), esters have {@{[boiling points](boiling%20point.md) and [melting points](melting%20point.md) in between comparable [alkanes](alkane.md) and [alcohols](alcohol.md)}@}.

### density

Esters are {@{less [dense](density.md) than [water](water.md)}@}. Density {@{decrease}@} with increasing size.

### odor

Most esters have {@{a pleasant fruity smell}@}.

### solubility

Esters {@{that are small are [soluble](solubility.md) in [water](water.md)}@}. Solubility {@{decreases}@} the larger the ester.

## chemical properties

### hydrolysis

In acid [hydrolysis](hydrolysis.md), esters {@{undergo the reverse of [Fischer–Speier esterification](Fischer–Speier%20esterification.md) in [acidic](acid.md) conditions}@}. {@{Non-[dehydrating](dehydration%20reaction.md) dilute acids are used with heating (under [reflux](reflux.md))}@} to speed up the reaction. The reaction is {@{[reversible](reversible%20reaction.md)}@}.

In alkaline [hydrolysis](hydrolysis.md), esters {@{are attacked by [nucleophilic](nucleophile.md) [hydroxide](hydroxide.md) to give [carboxylates](carboxylate.md) and [alcohols](alcohol.md) in [basic](base%20(chemistry).md) conditions}@}. {@{Heating (under [reflux](reflux.md))}@} is used to speed up the reaction. Carboxylates can then be {@{[protonated](protonation.md) by increasing the [acidity](pH.md) like adding dilute [acids](acid.md)}@}. It is the basis of {@{[saponification](saponification.md)}@}.

### reactions

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects('23af', '333d'),
  (
    '[hydrolysis](#hydrolysis)',
  ),
)
```
