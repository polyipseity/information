# pulsar

A __pulsar__ (from {@{_<b>pulsa</b>ting <b>r</b>adio source_}@}) is {@{a highly magnetized rotating [neutron star](neutron%20star.md) that emits beams of [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) out of its [magnetic poles](poles%20of%20astronomical%20bodies.md#magnetic%20poles)}@}. This radiation can be observed {@{only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth (similar to the way a [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer)}@}, and is responsible for {@{the pulsed appearance of emission}@}. Neutron stars are {@{very [dense](density.md) and have short, regular rotational [periods](frequency.md)}@}. This produces {@{a very precise interval between pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar}@}. Pulsars are one of the candidates for {@{the source of [ultra-high-energy cosmic rays](ultra-high-energy%20cosmic%20ray.md)}@}. (See also [centrifugal mechanism of acceleration](centrifugal%20acceleration%20(astrophysics).md).) <!--SR:!2025-06-29,253,330!2026-02-24,387,290!2025-06-19,224,290!2026-07-10,518,310!2025-06-30,253,330!2025-05-22,219,330!2027-01-21,686,330-->
