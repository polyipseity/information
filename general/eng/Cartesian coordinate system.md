Cartesian coordinates are {@{the foundation of [analytic geometry](analytic%20geometry.md)}@}, and provide {@{enlightening geometric interpretations for many other branches of mathematics}@}, such as {@{[linear algebra](linear%20algebra.md), [complex analysis](complex%20analysis.md), [differential geometry](differential%20geometry.md), multivariate [calculus](calculus.md), [group theory](group%20theory.md)}@} and more. A familiar example is the concept of {@{the [graph of a function](graph%20of%20a%20function.md)}@}. Cartesian coordinates are also essential tools for {@{most applied disciplines that deal with geometry}@}, including {@{[astronomy](astronomy.md), [physics](physics.md), [engineering](engineering.md)}@} and many more.

## history

{@{The adjective _Cartesian_}@} refers to {@{the French [mathematician](mathematician.md) and [philosopher](philosopher.md) [René Descartes](René%20Descartes.md)}@}, who {@{published this idea in 1637 while he was resident in the Netherlands}@}. It was independently {@{discovered by [Pierre de Fermat](Pierre%20de%20Fermat.md)}@}, who also {@{worked in three dimensions}@}, although {@{Fermat did not publish the discovery}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {@{The French cleric [Nicole Oresme](Nicole%20Oresme.md#mathematics)}@} used {@{constructions similar to Cartesian coordinates well before the time of Descartes and Fermat}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-23,268,330!2027-07-13,672,329!2026-04-22,342,349!2026-06-26,396,362!2026-05-09,352,349!2026-04-24,344,349!2026-06-30,396,362!2026-04-19,339,349-->

{@{Both Descartes and Fermat}@} used {@{a single axis in their treatments and have a variable length measured in reference to this axis}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> The concept of {@{using a pair of axes}@} was {@{introduced later, after Descartes' _[La Géométrie](La%20Géométrie.md)_ was translated into Latin}@} in {@{1649 by [Frans van Schooten](Frans%20van%20Schooten.md) and his students}@}. These commentators {@{introduced several concepts}@} while {@{trying to clarify the ideas contained in Descartes's work}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-12-07,1086,350!2026-06-08,380,362!2026-06-27,397,362!2027-07-06,666,329!2026-02-23,275,290!2026-06-25,395,362!2026-05-28,371,362-->

{@{The development of the Cartesian coordinate system}@} would {@{play a fundamental role in the development of the [calculus](calculus.md)}@} by {@{[Isaac Newton](Isaac%20Newton.md) and [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz.md)}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> {@{The two-coordinate description of the plane}@} was later {@{generalized into the concept of [vector spaces](vector%20spaces.md)}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-03-12,309,349!2026-06-12,384,362!2026-04-27,347,349!2026-03-21,317,349!2026-04-05,325,349-->

{@{Many other coordinate systems}@} have been {@{developed since Descartes}@}, such as {@{the [polar coordinates](polar%20coordinate%20system.md) for the plane}@}, and {@{the [spherical](spherical%20coordinate%20system.md) and [cylindrical coordinates](cylindrical%20coordinate%20system.md) for three-dimensional space}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-01,275,330!2026-03-14,311,349!2026-03-13,310,349!2027-07-30,686,329-->

## description

### one dimension

- Main article: ::@:: [Number line](number%20line.md) <!--SR:!2026-03-13,310,349!2026-04-02,322,349-->

{@{An [affine line](affine%20line.md) with a chosen Cartesian coordinate system}@} is called {@{a _number line_}@}. {@{Every point on the line}@} has {@{a real-number coordinate}@}, and {@{every real number represents some point on the line}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-19,339,349!2026-01-05,255,330!2026-06-20,391,362!2026-05-29,372,362!2026-06-21,392,362-->

There are {@{two [degrees of freedom](degree%20of%20freedom.md)}@} in {@{the choice of Cartesian coordinate system for a line}@}, which can be specified by {@{choosing two distinct points along the line}@} and {@{assigning them to two distinct [real numbers](real%20number.md) \(most commonly zero and one\)}@}. Other points can then be {@{uniquely assigned to numbers by [linear interpolation](linear%20interpolation.md)}@}. Equivalently, {@{one point can be assigned to a specific real number}@}, for instance {@{an _origin_ point corresponding to zero}@}, and {@{an [oriented](curve%20orientation.md) length along the line can be chosen as a unit}@}, with the orientation {@{indicating the correspondence between directions along the line and positive or negative numbers}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> Each point corresponds to {@{its signed distance from the origin}@} \(a number with {@{an absolute value equal to the distance and a + or − sign chosen based on direction}@}\). <!--SR:!2026-06-01,375,362!2028-09-17,1020,349!2026-03-14,311,349!2027-07-28,685,329!2026-04-08,328,349!2026-02-02,276,330!2026-06-18,389,362!2026-06-28,398,362!2026-03-14,311,349!2025-12-31,250,330!2026-06-19,390,362-->

{@{A [geometric transformation](geometric%20transformation.md) of the line}@} can be represented by {@{a [function of a real variable](function%20of%20a%20real%20variable.md)}@}, for example {@{[translation](translation%20(geometry).md) of the line corresponds to addition}@}, and {@{[scaling](scaling%20(geometry).md) the line corresponds to multiplication}@}. {@{Any two Cartesian coordinate systems on the line}@} can be {@{related to each-other}@} by {@{a [linear function](linear%20function.md) \(function of the form $x\mapsto ax+b$\) taking a specific point's coordinate in one system to its coordinate in the other system}@}. {@{Choosing a coordinate system for each of two different lines}@} establishes {@{an [affine map](affine%20transformation.md) from one line to the other}@} taking {@{each point on one line to the point on the other line with the same coordinate}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-25,294,330!2025-12-25,245,330!2028-10-13,1042,350!2026-04-06,326,349!2026-06-08,380,362!2026-06-03,377,362!2026-05-07,350,349!2026-05-21,364,362!2026-03-07,304,349!2026-03-07,304,349-->

### two dimensions

- Further information: ::@:: [Two-dimensional space](two-dimensional%20space.md) <!--SR:!2026-06-05,379,362!2026-03-13,310,349-->

{@{A Cartesian coordinate system in two dimensions}@} \(also called {@{a __rectangular coordinate system__ or an __orthogonal coordinate system__}@}<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup>\) is defined by {@{an [ordered pair](ordered%20pair.md) of [perpendicular](perpendicular.md) lines \(axes\), a single [unit of length](unit%20of%20length.md) for both axes, and an orientation for each axis}@}. {@{The point where the axes meet}@} is {@{taken as the origin for both}@}, thus {@{turning each axis into a number line}@}. For {@{any point _P_}@}, {@{a line is drawn through _P_ perpendicular to each axis}@}, and {@{the position where it meets the axis is interpreted as a number}@}. {@{The two numbers, in that chosen order}@}, are {@{the _Cartesian coordinates_ of _P_}@}. {@{The reverse construction}@} allows one to {@{determine the point _P_ given its coordinates}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-08,305,349!2026-06-07,379,362!2026-03-24,320,349!2026-03-12,309,349!2026-04-04,324,349!2026-03-13,310,349!2026-01-05,255,330!2026-05-07,350,349!2026-03-14,311,349!2026-01-04,254,330!2026-05-07,350,349!2026-05-05,348,349!2026-05-08,351,349-->

{@{The first and second coordinates}@} are called {@{the _[abscissa](abscissa.md)_ and the _[ordinate](ordinate.md)_ of _P_}@}, respectively; and {@{the point where the axes meet}@} is called {@{the _origin_ of the coordinate system}@}. The coordinates are usually written as {@{two numbers in parentheses, in that order, separated by a comma, as in \(3, −10.5\)}@}. Thus {@{the origin}@} has {@{coordinates \(0, 0\)}@}, and {@{the points on the positive half-axes, one unit away from the origin}@}, have {@{coordinates \(1, 0\) and \(0, 1\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-17,314,349!2026-06-13,385,362!2026-03-12,309,349!2028-12-22,1099,350!2026-03-09,306,349!2026-05-07,350,349!2026-05-01,344,349!2026-05-04,347,349!2026-04-22,342,349-->

In {@{mathematics, physics, and engineering}@}, {@{the first axis}@} is usually {@{defined or depicted as horizontal and oriented to the right}@}, and {@{the second axis is vertical and oriented upwards}@}. \(However, in {@{some [computer graphics](computer%20graphics.md) contexts}@}, {@{the ordinate axis may be oriented downwards}@}.\) {@{The origin}@} is often {@{labeled _O_}@}, and {@{the two coordinates}@} are often {@{denoted by the letters _X_ and _Y_, or _x_ and _y_}@}. {@{The axes}@} may then be referred to as {@{the _X_-axis and _Y_-axis}@}. {@{The choices of letters}@} come from {@{the original convention}@}, which is to {@{use the latter part of the alphabet to indicate unknown values}@}. {@{The first part of the alphabet}@} was used to {@{designate known values}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-18,315,349!2028-11-03,1059,350!2026-06-24,394,362!2026-05-08,351,349!2026-06-04,378,362!2026-06-26,396,362!2026-07-02,398,362!2026-05-23,366,362!2026-06-29,395,362!2026-04-09,329,349!2026-05-06,349,349!2026-04-07,327,349!2026-03-11,308,349!2026-01-01,251,330!2026-05-19,362,362!2026-05-16,359,362!2026-05-20,363,362-->

{@{A [Euclidean plane](Euclidean%20plane.md) with a chosen Cartesian coordinate system}@} is called {@{a __Cartesian plane__}@}. In a Cartesian plane, one can define {@{canonical representatives of certain geometric figures}@}, such as {@{the [unit circle](unit%20circle.md) \(with radius equal to the length unit, and center at the origin\)}@}, {@{the [unit square](unit%20square.md) \(whose diagonal has endpoints at \(0, 0\) and \(1, 1\)\)}@}, {@{the [unit hyperbola](unit%20hyperbola.md)}@}, and so on. <!--SR:!2026-06-17,388,362!2026-02-01,275,330!2026-04-20,340,349!2028-03-15,856,342!2026-05-05,348,349!2026-02-02,276,330-->

The two axes {@{divide the plane into four [right angles](right%20angle.md)}@}, called {@{_quadrants_}@}. The quadrants may be {@{named or numbered in various ways}@}, but {@{the quadrant where all coordinates are positive}@} is usually called {@{the _first quadrant_}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-09,352,349!2026-06-30,396,362!2026-04-08,328,349!2026-06-06,378,362!2026-06-23,393,362-->

If {@{the coordinates of a point are \(_x_, _y_\)}@}, then {@{its [distances](distance%20from%20a%20point%20to%20a%20line.md) from the _X_-axis and from the _Y_-axis}@} are {@{\|_y_\| and \|_x_\|, respectively}@}; where {@{\| · \| denotes the [absolute value](absolute%20value%20(algebra).md) of a number}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-14,311,349!2026-06-24,394,362!2026-02-02,276,330!2026-05-08,351,349-->

{@{A Cartesian coordinate system for a three-dimensional space}@} consists of {@{an ordered triplet of lines \(the _axes_\) that go through a common point \(the _origin_\)}@}, and are {@{pair-wise perpendicular}@}; {@{an orientation for each axis; and a single unit of length for all three axes}@}. As in {@{the two-dimensional case}@}, {@{each axis becomes a number line}@}. For {@{any point _P_ of space}@}, one considers {@{a plane through _P_ perpendicular to each coordinate axis}@}, and {@{interprets the point where that plane cuts the axis as a number}@}. {@{The Cartesian coordinates of _P_}@} are {@{those three numbers, in the chosen order}@}. {@{The reverse construction}@} {@{determines the point _P_ given its three coordinates}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-05,348,349!2026-01-03,253,330!2026-05-04,347,349!2026-03-08,305,349!2026-05-27,370,362!2026-03-12,309,349!2026-06-14,386,362!2028-12-29,1104,350!2026-01-05,255,330!2026-03-12,309,349!2028-12-23,1098,350!2026-03-11,308,349!2026-05-04,347,349-->

Alternatively, {@{each coordinate of a point _P_}@} can be taken as {@{the distance from _P_ to the plane defined by the other two axes}@}, with {@{the sign determined by the orientation of the corresponding axis}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-02,345,349!2026-05-26,369,362!2026-04-20,340,349-->

{@{Each pair of axes}@} defines {@{a _coordinate plane_}@}. These planes {@{divide space into eight _[octants](octant%20(solid%20geometry).md)_}@}. The octants are: {@{$${\begin{aligned}(+x,+y,+z)&&(-x,+y,+z)&&(+x,-y,+z)&&(+x,+y,-z)\\(+x,-y,-z)&&(-x,+y,-z)&&(-x,-y,+z)&&(-x,-y,-z)\end{aligned} }$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-01-26,271,330!2026-05-18,361,362!2026-06-12,384,362!2026-03-14,311,349-->

Thus, {@{the origin}@} has {@{coordinates \(0, 0, 0\)}@}, and {@{the unit points on the three axes}@} are {@{\(1, 0, 0\), \(0, 1, 0\), and \(0, 0, 1\)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-10-24,1050,350!2026-04-03,323,349!2028-11-05,1060,350!2026-05-22,365,362!2025-12-22,243,330!2025-12-26,5,369!2025-12-26,5,369-->

### generalizations

{@{The concept of Cartesian coordinates}@} {@{generalizes to allow axes that are not perpendicular to each other}@}, and/or {@{different units along each axis}@}. In that case, {@{each coordinate is obtained}@} by {@{projecting the point onto one axis along a direction that is parallel to the other axis}@} \(or, in general, to {@{the [hyperplane](hyperplane.md) defined by all the other axes}@}\). In {@{such an _[oblique coordinate system](oblique%20coordinate%20system.md)_}@} {@{the computations of distances and angles}@} must be {@{modified from that in standard Cartesian systems}@}, and {@{many standard formulas \(such as the Pythagorean formula for the distance\) do not hold}@} \(see {@{[affine plane](affine%20plane.md)}@}\). <!--SR:!2026-04-03,323,349!2026-07-02,398,362!2026-06-30,396,362!2026-05-08,351,349!2026-01-05,255,330!2026-06-15,387,362!2026-03-19,315,349!2028-08-01,985,349!2026-05-07,350,349!2026-06-10,382,362!2026-04-05,325,349-->

## notations and conventions

{@{The Cartesian coordinates of a point}@} are usually {@{written in [parentheses](parentheses.md#parentheses) and separated by commas, as in \(10, 5\) or \(3, 5, 7\)}@}. {@{The origin}@} is often {@{labelled with the capital letter _O_}@}. In {@{analytic geometry}@}, {@{unknown or generic coordinates}@} are often {@{denoted by the letters \(_x_, _y_\) in the plane, and \(_x_, _y_, _z_\) in three-dimensional space}@}. This custom comes from {@{a convention of algebra}@}, which {@{uses letters near the end of the alphabet for unknown values \(such as the coordinates of points in many geometric problems\)}@}, and {@{letters near the beginning for given quantities}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-30,343,349!2026-06-02,376,362!2026-03-24,320,349!2026-06-11,383,362!2025-12-25,246,330!2026-01-03,253,330!2026-01-03,253,330!2026-03-04,301,349!2026-05-07,350,349!2026-03-18,315,349-->

{@{These conventional names}@} are often {@{used in other domains}@}, such as {@{physics and engineering}@}, although {@{other letters may be used}@}. For example, in {@{a graph showing how a [pressure](pressure.md) varies with [time](time.md)}@}, {@{the graph coordinates}@} may be denoted {@{_p_ and _t_}@}. Each axis is usually {@{named after the coordinate which is measured along it}@}; so one says {@{the _x-axis_, the _y-axis_, the _t-axis_, etc.}@} <!--SR:!2026-05-07,350,349!2026-05-09,352,349!2026-06-06,378,362!2026-06-21,392,362!2026-04-05,325,349!2026-05-04,347,349!2026-05-01,344,349!2026-04-08,328,349!2026-03-12,309,349-->

{@{Another common convention for coordinate naming}@} is to {@{use subscripts}@}, as {@{\(_x_<sub>1</sub>, _x_<sub>2</sub>, ..., _x_<sub>_n_</sub>\) for the _n_ coordinates in an _n_-dimensional space}@}, especially when {@{_n_ is greater than 3 or unspecified}@}. Some authors prefer {@{the numbering \(_x_<sub>0</sub>, _x_<sub>1</sub>, ..., _x_<sub>_n_<!-- markdown separator -->−1</sub>\)}@}. These notations are especially advantageous in {@{[computer programming](computer%20programming.md)}@}: by {@{storing the coordinates of a point as an [array](array%20data%20type.md), instead of a [record](record%20(computer%20science).md)}@}, the [subscript](subscript.md) can {@{serve to index the coordinates}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-13,310,349!2026-06-18,389,362!2026-05-03,346,349!2026-01-02,252,330!2026-04-26,346,349!2026-05-09,352,349!2026-01-05,255,330!2026-04-01,321,349-->

In {@{mathematical illustrations of two-dimensional Cartesian systems}@}, {@{the first coordinate \(traditionally called the [abscissa](abscissa.md)\)}@} is measured {@{along a [horizontal](horizontal%20plane.md) axis, oriented from left to right}@}. {@{The second coordinate \(the [ordinate](ordinate.md)\)}@} is then measured {@{along a [vertical](vertical%20direction.md) axis, usually oriented from bottom to top}@}. {@{Young children learning the Cartesian system}@}, commonly learn the order to {@{read the values before cementing the _x_-, _y_-, and _z_-axis concepts}@}, by starting with {@{2D mnemonics}@} \(for example, {@{'Walk along the hall then up the stairs'}@} akin to {@{straight across the _x_-axis then up vertically along the _y_-axis}@}\). <!--SR:!2026-03-07,304,349!2026-06-28,398,362!2026-01-23,268,330!2026-03-09,306,349!2028-12-05,1085,350!2026-04-27,347,349!2026-03-19,316,349!2026-06-03,377,362!2026-03-10,307,349!2026-03-11,308,349-->

{@{Computer graphics and [image processing](image%20processing.md)}@}, however, often {@{use a coordinate system with the _y_-axis oriented downwards on the computer display}@}. This convention developed in {@{the 1960s \(or earlier\)}@} from the way that {@{images were originally stored in [display buffers](framebuffer.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-24,394,362!2026-03-22,318,349!2027-02-19,544,310!2026-03-06,303,349-->

For {@{three-dimensional systems}@}, a convention is to {@{portray the _xy_-plane horizontally, with the _z_-axis added to represent height \(positive up\)}@}. Furthermore, there is a convention to {@{orient the _x_-axis toward the viewer, biased either to the right or left}@}. If {@{a diagram \([3D projection](3D%20projection.md) or [2D perspective drawing](perspective%20(graphical).md)\)}@} shows {@{the _x_- and _y_-axis horizontally and vertically}@}, respectively, then {@{the _z_-axis should be shown pointing "out of the page" towards the viewer or camera}@}. In such {@{a 2D diagram of a 3D coordinate system}@}, the _z_-axis would appear as {@{a line or ray pointing down and to the left or down and to the right}@}, depending on {@{the presumed viewer or camera [perspective](perspective%20(graphical).md)}@}. In {@{any diagram or display}@}, {@{the orientation of the three axes, as a whole, is arbitrary}@}. However, {@{the orientation of the axes relative to each other}@} should {@{always comply with the [right-hand rule](right-hand%20rule.md), unless specifically stated otherwise}@}. {@{All laws of physics and math}@} assume {@{this [right-handedness](#orientation%20and%20handedness), which ensures consistency}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-30,250,330!2026-03-10,307,349!2026-05-31,374,362!2026-05-02,345,349!2028-12-21,1097,350!2026-01-01,251,330!2026-01-25,270,330!2028-10-25,1051,350!2026-06-02,376,362!2026-06-05,377,362!2026-06-19,390,362!2026-03-14,311,349!2026-05-04,347,349!2026-06-29,395,362!2026-05-03,346,349-->

For 3D diagrams, {@{the names "abscissa" and "ordinate" are rarely used for _x_ and _y_, respectively}@}. When they are, {@{the _z_-coordinate is sometimes called the __applicate__}@}. The words _abscissa_, _ordinate_ and _applicate_ are sometimes used to {@{refer to coordinate axes rather than the coordinate values}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-05-04,347,349!2026-03-14,311,349!2026-05-30,373,362-->

When {@{the axes are drawn according to the mathematical custom}@}, the numbering {@{goes [counter-clockwise](clockwise.md) starting from the upper right \("north-east"\) quadrant}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-25,294,330!2026-03-23,319,349!2026-03-19,316,349!2026-04-25,345,349!2026-03-07,304,349!2026-05-07,350,349!2026-03-06,303,349-->

Similarly, a three-dimensional Cartesian system defines {@{a division of space into eight regions or __octants__}@},<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> according to {@{the signs of the coordinates of the points}@}. {@{The convention used for naming a specific octant}@} is {@{to list its signs; for example, \(+ + +\) or \(− + −\)}@}. {@{The generalization of the quadrant and octant to an arbitrary number of dimensions}@} is {@{the __[orthant](orthant.md)__}@}, and {@{a similar naming system applies}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-10,307,349!2026-03-24,320,349!2026-06-24,394,362!2025-12-29,249,330!2026-01-04,254,330!2026-06-27,397,362!2026-06-29,395,362-->

## Cartesian formulae for the plane

### distance between two points

{@{The [Euclidean distance](Euclidean%20distance.md)}@} between {@{two points of the plane with Cartesian coordinates $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})$}@} is {@{$$d={\sqrt {(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2} } }.$$}@} This is {@{the Cartesian version of [Pythagoras's theorem](Pythagoras's%20theorem.md)}@}.

### Euclidean transformations

{@{The [Euclidean transformations](Euclidean%20plane%20isometry.md) or __Euclidean motions__}@} are {@{the \([bijective](bijective.md)\) mappings of points of the [Euclidean plane](Euclidean%20plane.md) to themselves which preserve distances between points}@}. There are {@{four types of these mappings \(also called isometries\)}@}: {@{[translations](translation%20(geometry).md), [rotations](rotation%20(mathematics).md), [reflections](reflection%20(mathematics).md) and [glide reflections](glide%20reflection.md) (annotation: translation + reflection)}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-05-28,371,362!2026-03-19,114,309!2025-12-29,248,330!2026-04-23,343,349-->

#### translation

{@{[Translating](translation%20(geometry).md) a set of points of the plane, preserving the distances and directions between them}@}, is equivalent to {@{adding a fixed pair of numbers \(_a_, _b_\) to the Cartesian coordinates of every point in the set}@}.

#### rotation

To {@{[rotate](rotation%20(geometry).md) a figure [counterclockwise](clockwise.md) around the origin by some angle $\theta$}@} is equivalent to {@{replacing every point with coordinates \(_x_,_y_\) by the point with coordinates \(_x'_,_y'_\)}@}, where {@{$${\begin{aligned}x'&=x\cos \theta -y\sin \theta \\y'&=x\sin \theta +y\cos \theta .\end{aligned} }$$}@} Thus: {@{$$(x',y')=((x\cos \theta -y\sin \theta \,),(x\sin \theta +y\cos \theta \,)).$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-01-24,269,330!2026-06-13,385,362!2026-08-23,379,302!2028-08-06,985,349-->

#### reflection

If {@{\(_x_, _y_\) are the Cartesian coordinates of a point}@}, then {@{\(−<!-- markdown separator -->_x_, _y_\)}@} are {@{the coordinates of its [reflection](coordinate%20rotations%20and%20reflections.md) across the second coordinate axis \(the y-axis\)}@}, as if {@{that line were a mirror}@}.

In more generality, {@{reflection across a line through the origin making an angle $\theta$ with the x-axis}@}, is equivalent to {@{replacing every point with coordinates \(_x_, _y_\) by the point with coordinates \(_x_<!-- markdown separator -->′,_y_<!-- markdown separator -->′\)}@}, where {@{$${\begin{aligned}x'&=x\cos 2\theta +y\sin 2\theta \\y'&=x\sin 2\theta -y\cos 2\theta .\end{aligned} }$$}@} Thus: {@{$$(x',y')=((x\cos 2\theta +y\sin 2\theta \,),(x\sin 2\theta -y\cos 2\theta \,)).$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-05-24,367,362!2026-03-14,311,349!2026-05-01,344,349!2026-05-31,374,362!2026-06-25,395,362!2026-06-27,397,362!2026-05-08,351,349!2028-02-21,838,342!2026-02-03,243,289!2026-03-30,297,290-->

#### glide reflection

{@{A glide reflection}@} is {@{the composition of a reflection across a line followed by a translation in the direction of that line}@}. It can be seen that {@{the order of these operations does not matter}@} \({@{the translation can come first, followed by the reflection}@}\). <!--SR:!2026-03-15,312,349!2026-04-26,346,349!2026-06-26,396,362!2026-03-12,309,349-->

#### general matrix form of the transformations

{@{All [affine transformations](affine%20transformation.md) of the plane}@} can be described {@{in a uniform way by using matrices}@}.

Among {@{the affine transformations}@}, {@{the [Euclidean transformations](euclidean%20transformation.md)}@} are characterized by the fact that {@{the matrix $A$ is [orthogonal](orthogonal%20matrix.md)}@}; that is, {@{its columns are [orthogonal vectors](orthogonal%20vectors.md#orthogonal%20vectors) of [Euclidean norm](Euclidean%20norm.md#Euclidean%20norm) one}@}, or, explicitly, {@{$$A_{1,1}A_{1,2}+A_{2,1}A_{2,2}=0$$ and $$A_{1,1}^{2}+A_{2,1}^{2}=A_{1,2}^{2}+A_{2,2}^{2}=1.$$}@} This is equivalent to saying that {@{_A_ times its [transpose](transpose.md) is the [identity matrix](identity%20matrix.md)}@}.

Assuming that {@{translations are not used \(that is, $b_{1}=b_{2}=0$\)}@} transformations can be {@{[composed](function%20composition.md) by simply multiplying the associated transformation matrices}@}.

{@{Fixing or choosing the _x_-axis}@} {@{determines the _y_-axis up to direction}@}.

But there is {@{a choice of which of the two half lines on the perpendicular to designate as positive and which as negative}@}.

The usual way of orienting the plane, with {@{the positive _x_-axis pointing right and the positive _y_-axis pointing up \(and the _x_-axis being the "first" and the _y_-axis the "second" axis\)}@}, is considered {@{the _positive_ or _standard_ orientation, also called the _right-handed_ orientation}@}. <!--SR:!2027-07-26,686,330!2026-07-01,397,362-->

{@{A commonly used mnemonic for defining the positive orientation}@} is {@{the _[right-hand rule](right-hand%20rule.md)_}@}.

{@{The other way of orienting the plane}@} is {@{following the _left-hand rule_}@}, {@{placing the left hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-30,373,362!2026-03-13,310,349!2026-05-09,352,349-->

The thumb indicates {@{the _x_-axis}@}, {@{the index finger the _y_-axis and the middle finger the _z_-axis}@}. Conversely, if {@{the same is done with the left hand}@}, {@{a left-handed system results}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-10,382,362!2026-05-17,360,362!2026-06-23,393,362!2026-03-21,317,349!2026-06-24,394,362!2026-03-20,316,349!2026-04-26,346,349!2026-01-07,254,330!2026-05-09,352,349-->

Figure 7 depicts {@{a left and a right-handed coordinate system}@}. Because {@{a three-dimensional object is represented on the two-dimensional screen}@}, {@{distortion and ambiguity result}@}. {@{The axis pointing downward \(and to the right\)}@} is {@{also meant to point _towards_ the observer}@}, whereas {@{the "middle"-axis is meant to point _away_ from the observer}@}. The red circle is {@{_parallel_ to the horizontal _xy_-plane}@} and indicates {@{rotation from the _x_-axis to the _y_-axis \(in both cases\)}@}. Hence the red arrow {@{passes _in front of_ the _z_-axis}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-03,346,349!2026-05-28,371,362!2026-03-23,319,349!2026-06-26,396,362!2026-06-16,388,362!2027-08-18,699,330!2026-02-01,275,330!2026-01-02,252,330!2026-01-02,252,330-->

Figure 8 is {@{another attempt at depicting a right-handed coordinate system}@}. Again, there is {@{an ambiguity caused by projecting the three-dimensional coordinate system into the plane}@}. Many observers see Figure 8 as {@{"flipping in and out" between a [convex](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/convex) cube and a [concave](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/concave) "corner"}@}. This corresponds to {@{the two possible orientations of the space}@}. {@{Seeing the figure as convex}@} gives {@{a left-handed coordinate system}@}. Thus {@{the "correct" way to view Figure 8}@} is to {@{imagine the _x_-axis as pointing _towards_ the observer}@} and thus {@{seeing a concave corner}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-21,317,349!2026-01-05,255,330!2026-05-09,352,349!2026-04-01,321,349!2026-04-03,323,349!2027-09-27,730,330!2028-09-25,1026,350!2028-10-02,1033,350!2026-01-02,24,388-->

## representing a vector in the standard basis

{@{A point in space in a Cartesian coordinate system}@} may also be represented by {@{a position [vector](Euclidean%20vector.md)}@}, which can be thought of as {@{an arrow pointing from the origin of the coordinate system to the point}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> If {@{the coordinates represent spatial positions \(displacements\)}@}, it is common to represent {@{the vector from the origin to the point of interest}@} as {@{$\mathbf {r}$}@}. In {@{two dimensions}@}, {@{the vector from the origin to the point with Cartesian coordinates \(x, y\)}@} can be written as: {@{$$\mathbf {r} =x\mathbf {i} +y\mathbf {j} ,$$}@} where {@{$\mathbf {i} ={\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix} }$ and $\mathbf {j} ={\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\end{pmatrix} }$}@} are {@{[unit vectors](unit%20vectors.md) in the direction of the _x_-axis and _y_-axis respectively}@}, generally referred to as {@{the _[standard basis](standard%20basis.md)_}@} \(in some application areas these may also be referred to as {@{[versors](versor.md)}@}\). Similarly, in {@{three dimensions}@}, {@{the vector from the origin to the point with Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$}@} can be written as:<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> {@{$$\mathbf {r} =x\mathbf {i} +y\mathbf {j} +z\mathbf {k} ,$$}@} where {@{$\mathbf {i} ={\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix} }$, $\mathbf {j} ={\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix} }$, and $\mathbf {k} ={\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix} }$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-14,386,362!2026-06-16,388,362!2026-04-30,343,349!2026-04-02,322,349!2026-05-06,349,349!2026-04-07,327,349!2028-12-23,1099,350!2026-06-04,378,362!2026-05-03,346,349!2026-06-28,398,362!2026-06-23,393,362!2026-06-02,376,362!2026-03-14,311,349!2026-07-01,397,362!2026-04-21,341,349!2026-05-29,372,362!2026-06-20,391,362-->

There is no {@{_natural_ interpretation of multiplying vectors to obtain another vector that works in all dimensions}@}, however there is a way to {@{use [complex numbers](complex%20number.md) to provide such a multiplication}@}. In {@{a two-dimensional cartesian plane}@}, identify {@{the point with coordinates \(_x_, _y_\) with the complex number _z_ = _x_ + _iy_}@}. Here, _i_ is {@{the [imaginary unit](imaginary%20unit.md) and is identified with the point with coordinates \(0, 1\)}@}, so it is {@{_not_ the unit vector in the direction of the _x_-axis}@}. Since {@{the complex numbers can be multiplied giving another complex number}@}, this identification provides {@{a means to "multiply" vectors}@}. In {@{a three-dimensional cartesian space}@} a similar identification can be made with {@{a subset of the [quaternions](quaternion.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-05,348,349!2026-06-23,393,362!2026-03-19,316,349!2026-04-20,340,349!2028-01-14,766,330!2028-11-04,1059,350!2026-03-10,307,349!2026-06-04,378,362!2026-04-09,329,349!2026-06-29,395,362-->
