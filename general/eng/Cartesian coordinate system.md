# Cartesian coordinate system

> {@{![A small portion of the Cartesian coordinate system, showing the origin, axes, and the four quadrants, with illustrative points and grid.](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg)}@}

> Illustration of {@{a Cartesian coordinate plane}@}. Four points are {@{marked and labeled with their coordinates}@}: {@{\(2, 3\) in green, \(−3, 1\) in red, \(−1.5, −2.5\) in blue, and the origin \(0, 0\) in purple}@}.

In {@{[geometry](geometry.md)}@}, {@{a __Cartesian coordinate system__}@} \([UK](British%20English.md): [/kɑːrˈtiːzjən/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English), [US](American%20English.md): [/kɑːrˈtiːʒən/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)\) in {@{a [plane](plane%20(geometry).md) is a [coordinate system](coordinate%20system.md) that specifies each [point](point%20(geometry).md) uniquely by a pair of [real numbers](real%20number.md) called _coordinates_}@}, which are {@{the [signed](positive%20and%20negative%20numbers.md) distances to the point from two fixed [perpendicular](perpendicular.md) [oriented lines](oriented%20line.md#on%20a%20line)}@}, called {@{_[coordinate lines](coordinate%20line.md#coordinate%20line)_, _coordinate axes_ or just _axes_ \(plural of _axis_\) of the system}@}. {@{The point where the axes meet}@} is called {@{the _[origin](origin%20(mathematics).md)_ and has \(0, 0\) as coordinates}@}. {@{The axes [directions](direction%20(geometry).md)}@} represent {@{an [orthogonal basis](orthogonal%20basis.md)}@}. {@{The combination of origin and basis}@} forms {@{a [coordinate frame](coordinate%20frame.md#coordinates) called the __Cartesian frame__}@}.

Similarly, {@{the position of any point in [three-dimensional space](three-dimensional%20space.md)}@} can be specified by {@{three _Cartesian coordinates_}@}, which are {@{the signed distances from the point to three mutually perpendicular planes}@}. More generally, {@{_n_ Cartesian coordinates}@} specify {@{the point in an _n_-dimensional [Euclidean space](Euclidean%20space.md) for any [dimension](dimension.md) _n_}@}. These coordinates are {@{the signed distances from the point to _n_ mutually perpendicular fixed [hyperplanes](hyperplane.md)}@}.

>
> Cartesian coordinate system with {@{a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin marked in red}@}. {@{The equation of a circle}@} is {@{\(_x_ − _a_\)<sup>2</sup> + \(_y_ − _b_\)<sup>2</sup> = _r_<sup>2</sup>}@} where {@{_a_ and _b_ are the coordinates of the center \(_a_, _b_\) and _r_ is the radius}@}.

Cartesian coordinates are named for {@{[René Descartes](René%20Descartes.md), whose invention of them in the 17th century}@} {@{revolutionized mathematics}@} by allowing {@{the expression of problems of geometry in terms of [algebra](algebra.md) and [calculus](calculus.md)}@}. Using the Cartesian coordinate system, {@{geometric shapes \(such as [curves](curve.md)\)}@} can be {@{described by [equations](equation.md) involving the coordinates of points of the shape}@}. For example, {@{a [circle](circle.md) of radius 2, centered at the origin of the plane}@}, may be described as {@{the [set](set%20(mathematics).md) of all points}@} whose {@{coordinates _x_ and _y_ satisfy the equation _x_<sup>2</sup> + _y_<sup>2</sup> = 4}@}; {@{the [area](area.md), the [perimeter](perimeter.md) and the [tangent line](tangent%20line.md) at any point}@} can be {@{computed from this equation}@} by {@{using [integrals](integral.md) and [derivatives](derivative.md), in a way that can be applied to any curve}@}.

Cartesian coordinates are {@{the foundation of [analytic geometry](analytic%20geometry.md)}@}, and provide {@{enlightening geometric interpretations for many other branches of mathematics}@}, such as {@{[linear algebra](linear%20algebra.md), [complex analysis](complex%20analysis.md), [differential geometry](differential%20geometry.md), multivariate [calculus](calculus.md), [group theory](group%20theory.md)}@} and more. A familiar example is the concept of {@{the [graph of a function](graph%20of%20a%20function.md)}@}. Cartesian coordinates are also essential tools for {@{most applied disciplines that deal with geometry}@}, including {@{[astronomy](astronomy.md), [physics](physics.md), [engineering](engineering.md)}@} and many more. They are {@{the most common coordinate system}@} used in {@{[computer graphics](computer%20graphics.md), [computer-aided geometric design](computer-aided%20geometric%20design.md) and other [geometry-related data processing](computational%20geometry.md)}@}.

## history

{@{The adjective _Cartesian_}@} refers to {@{the French [mathematician](mathematician.md) and [philosopher](philosopher.md) [René Descartes](René%20Descartes.md)}@}, who {@{published this idea in 1637 while he was resident in the Netherlands}@}. It was independently {@{discovered by [Pierre de Fermat](Pierre%20de%20Fermat.md)}@}, who also {@{worked in three dimensions}@}, although {@{Fermat did not publish the discovery}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {@{The French cleric [Nicole Oresme](Nicole%20Oresme.md#mathematics)}@} used {@{constructions similar to Cartesian coordinates well before the time of Descartes and Fermat}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup>

{@{Both Descartes and Fermat}@} used {@{a single axis in their treatments and have a variable length measured in reference to this axis}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> The concept of {@{using a pair of axes}@} was {@{introduced later, after Descartes' _[La Géométrie](La%20Géométrie.md)_ was translated into Latin}@} in {@{1649 by [Frans van Schooten](Frans%20van%20Schooten.md) and his students}@}. These commentators {@{introduced several concepts}@} while {@{trying to clarify the ideas contained in Descartes's work}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup>

{@{The development of the Cartesian coordinate system}@} would {@{play a fundamental role in the development of the [calculus](calculus.md)}@} by {@{[Isaac Newton](Isaac%20Newton.md) and [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz.md)}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> {@{The two-coordinate description of the plane}@} was later {@{generalized into the concept of [vector spaces](vector%20spaces.md)}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup>

{@{Many other coordinate systems}@} have been {@{developed since Descartes}@}, such as {@{the [polar coordinates](polar%20coordinate%20system.md) for the plane}@}, and {@{the [spherical](spherical%20coordinate%20system.md) and [cylindrical coordinates](cylindrical%20coordinate%20system.md) for three-dimensional space}@}.

## description

### one dimension

- Main article: ::@:: [Number line](number%20line.md)

{@{An [affine line](affine%20line.md) with a chosen Cartesian coordinate system}@} is called {@{a _number line_}@}. {@{Every point on the line}@} has {@{a real-number coordinate}@}, and {@{every real number represents some point on the line}@}.

There are {@{two [degrees of freedom](degree%20of%20freedom.md)}@} in {@{the choice of Cartesian coordinate system for a line}@}, which can be specified by {@{choosing two distinct points along the line}@} and {@{assigning them to two distinct [real numbers](real%20number.md) \(most commonly zero and one\)}@}. Other points can then be {@{uniquely assigned to numbers by [linear interpolation](linear%20interpolation.md)}@}. Equivalently, {@{one point can be assigned to a specific real number}@}, for instance {@{an _origin_ point corresponding to zero}@}, and {@{an [oriented](curve%20orientation.md) length along the line can be chosen as a unit}@}, with the orientation {@{indicating the correspondence between directions along the line and positive or negative numbers}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> Each point corresponds to {@{its signed distance from the origin}@} \(a number with {@{an absolute value equal to the distance and a + or − sign chosen based on direction}@}\).

{@{A [geometric transformation](geometric%20transformation.md) of the line}@} can be represented by {@{a [function of a real variable](function%20of%20a%20real%20variable.md)}@}, for example {@{[translation](translation%20(geometry).md) of the line corresponds to addition}@}, and {@{[scaling](scaling%20(geometry).md) the line corresponds to multiplication}@}. {@{Any two Cartesian coordinate systems on the line}@} can be {@{related to each-other}@} by {@{a [linear function](linear%20function.md) \(function of the form $x\mapsto ax+b$\) taking a specific point's coordinate in one system to its coordinate in the other system}@}. {@{Choosing a coordinate system for each of two different lines}@} establishes {@{an [affine map](affine%20transformation.md) from one line to the other}@} taking {@{each point on one line to the point on the other line with the same coordinate}@}.

### two dimensions

- Further information: ::@:: [Two-dimensional space](two-dimensional%20space.md)

{@{A Cartesian coordinate system in two dimensions}@} \(also called {@{a __rectangular coordinate system__ or an __orthogonal coordinate system__}@}<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup>\) is defined by {@{an [ordered pair](ordered%20pair.md) of [perpendicular](perpendicular.md) lines \(axes\), a single [unit of length](unit%20of%20length.md) for both axes, and an orientation for each axis}@}. {@{The point where the axes meet}@} is {@{taken as the origin for both}@}, thus {@{turning each axis into a number line}@}. For {@{any point _P_}@}, {@{a line is drawn through _P_ perpendicular to each axis}@}, and {@{the position where it meets the axis is interpreted as a number}@}. {@{The two numbers, in that chosen order}@}, are {@{the _Cartesian coordinates_ of _P_}@}. {@{The reverse construction}@} allows one to {@{determine the point _P_ given its coordinates}@}.

{@{The first and second coordinates}@} are called {@{the _[abscissa](abscissa.md)_ and the _[ordinate](ordinate.md)_ of _P_}@}, respectively; and {@{the point where the axes meet}@} is called {@{the _origin_ of the coordinate system}@}. The coordinates are usually written as {@{two numbers in parentheses, in that order, separated by a comma, as in \(3, −10.5\)}@}. Thus {@{the origin}@} has {@{coordinates \(0, 0\)}@}, and {@{the points on the positive half-axes, one unit away from the origin}@}, have {@{coordinates \(1, 0\) and \(0, 1\)}@}.

In {@{mathematics, physics, and engineering}@}, {@{the first axis}@} is usually {@{defined or depicted as horizontal and oriented to the right}@}, and {@{the second axis is vertical and oriented upwards}@}. \(However, in {@{some [computer graphics](computer%20graphics.md) contexts}@}, {@{the ordinate axis may be oriented downwards}@}.\) {@{The origin}@} is often {@{labeled _O_}@}, and {@{the two coordinates}@} are often {@{denoted by the letters _X_ and _Y_, or _x_ and _y_}@}. {@{The axes}@} may then be referred to as {@{the _X_-axis and _Y_-axis}@}. {@{The choices of letters}@} come from {@{the original convention}@}, which is to {@{use the latter part of the alphabet to indicate unknown values}@}. {@{The first part of the alphabet}@} was used to {@{designate known values}@}.

{@{A [Euclidean plane](Euclidean%20plane.md) with a chosen Cartesian coordinate system}@} is called {@{a __Cartesian plane__}@}. In a Cartesian plane, one can define {@{canonical representatives of certain geometric figures}@}, such as {@{the [unit circle](unit%20circle.md) \(with radius equal to the length unit, and center at the origin\)}@}, {@{the [unit square](unit%20square.md) \(whose diagonal has endpoints at \(0, 0\) and \(1, 1\)\)}@}, {@{the [unit hyperbola](unit%20hyperbola.md)}@}, and so on.

The two axes {@{divide the plane into four [right angles](right%20angle.md)}@}, called {@{_quadrants_}@}. The quadrants may be {@{named or numbered in various ways}@}, but {@{the quadrant where all coordinates are positive}@} is usually called {@{the _first quadrant_}@}.

If {@{the coordinates of a point are \(_x_, _y_\)}@}, then {@{its [distances](distance%20from%20a%20point%20to%20a%20line.md) from the _X_-axis and from the _Y_-axis}@} are {@{\|_y_\| and \|_x_\|, respectively}@}; where {@{\| · \| denotes the [absolute value](absolute%20value%20(algebra).md) of a number}@}.

### three dimensions

- Further information: ::@:: [Three-dimensional space](three-dimensional%20space.md)

> {@{![Illustration of the Cartesian coordinate system for 3D,](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Coord%20system%20CA%200.svg)}@}
>
> {@{A three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system}@}, with {@{origin _O_ and axis lines _X_, _Y_ and _Z_, oriented as shown by the arrows}@}. {@{The tick marks on the axes}@} are {@{one length unit apart}@}. {@{The black dot}@} shows {@{the point with coordinates _x_ = 2, _y_ = 3, and _z_ = 4, or \(2, 3, 4\)}@}.

{@{A Cartesian coordinate system for a three-dimensional space}@} consists of {@{an ordered triplet of lines \(the _axes_\) that go through a common point \(the _origin_\)}@}, and are {@{pair-wise perpendicular}@}; {@{an orientation for each axis; and a single unit of length for all three axes}@}. As in {@{the two-dimensional case}@}, {@{each axis becomes a number line}@}. For {@{any point _P_ of space}@}, one considers {@{a plane through _P_ perpendicular to each coordinate axis}@}, and {@{interprets the point where that plane cuts the axis as a number}@}. {@{The Cartesian coordinates of _P_}@} are {@{those three numbers, in the chosen order}@}. {@{The reverse construction}@} {@{determines the point _P_ given its three coordinates}@}.

Alternatively, {@{each coordinate of a point _P_}@} can be taken as {@{the distance from _P_ to the plane defined by the other two axes}@}, with {@{the sign determined by the orientation of the corresponding axis}@}.

{@{Each pair of axes}@} defines {@{a _coordinate plane_}@}. These planes {@{divide space into eight _[octants](octant%20(solid%20geometry).md)_}@}. The octants are: {@{$${\begin{aligned}(+x,+y,+z)&&(-x,+y,+z)&&(+x,-y,+z)&&(+x,+y,-z)\\(+x,-y,-z)&&(-x,+y,-z)&&(-x,-y,+z)&&(-x,-y,-z)\end{aligned} }$$}@}

The coordinates are usually written as {@{three numbers \(or algebraic formulas\) surrounded by parentheses and separated by commas, as in \(3, −2.5, 1\) or \(_t_, _u_ + _v_, _π_/2\)}@}. Thus, {@{the origin}@} has {@{coordinates \(0, 0, 0\)}@}, and {@{the unit points on the three axes}@} are {@{\(1, 0, 0\), \(0, 1, 0\), and \(0, 0, 1\)}@}.

{@{Standard names for the coordinates in the three axes}@} are {@{_abscissa_, _ordinate_ and _applicate_}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> The coordinates are often {@{denoted by the letters _x_, _y_, and _z_}@}. The axes may then be referred to as {@{the _x_-axis, _y_-axis, and _z_-axis, respectively}@}. Then {@{the coordinate planes}@} can be referred to as {@{the _xy_-plane, _yz_-plane, and _xz_-plane}@}.

In {@{mathematics, physics, and engineering contexts}@}, {@{the first two axes}@} are often {@{defined or depicted as horizontal, with the third axis pointing up}@}. In that case {@{the third coordinate}@} may be called {@{_height_ or _altitude_}@}. {@{The orientation}@} is usually {@{chosen so that the 90-degree angle from the first axis to the second axis looks counter-clockwise when seen from the point \(0, 0, 1\)}@}; a convention that is commonly called {@{_the [right-hand rule](right-hand%20rule.md)_}@}.

> {@{![Coordinate surfaces for a Cartesian coordinate system.](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Cartesian%20coordinate%20surfaces.png)}@}
>
> {@{The [coordinate surfaces](coordinate%20system.md#coordinate%20surface) of the Cartesian coordinates \(_x_, _y_, _z_\)}@}. The _z_-axis is {@{vertical}@} and {@{the _x_-axis is highlighted in green}@}. Thus, the red plane shows {@{the points with _x_ = 1}@}, {@{the blue plane shows the points with _z_ = 1, and the yellow plane shows the points with _y_ = −1}@}. The three surfaces {@{intersect at the point _P_ \(shown as a black sphere\) with the Cartesian coordinates \(1, −1, 1\)}@}.

### higher dimensions

Since {@{Cartesian coordinates are unique and non-ambiguous}@}, {@{the points of a Cartesian plane}@} can be {@{identified with pairs of [real numbers](real%20number.md)}@}; that is, with {@{the [Cartesian product](Cartesian%20product.md) $\mathbb {R} ^{2}=\mathbb {R} \times \mathbb {R}$}@}, where {@{$\mathbb {R}$ is the set of all real numbers}@}. In the same way, {@{the points in any [Euclidean space](Euclidean%20space.md) of dimension _n_}@} be {@{identified with the [tuples](tuple.md) \(lists\) of _n_ real numbers}@}; that is, with {@{the Cartesian product $\mathbb {R} ^{n}$}@}.

### generalizations

{@{The concept of Cartesian coordinates}@} {@{generalizes to allow axes that are not perpendicular to each other}@}, and/or {@{different units along each axis}@}. In that case, {@{each coordinate is obtained}@} by {@{projecting the point onto one axis along a direction that is parallel to the other axis}@} \(or, in general, to {@{the [hyperplane](hyperplane.md) defined by all the other axes}@}\). In {@{such an _[oblique coordinate system](oblique%20coordinate%20system.md)_}@} {@{the computations of distances and angles}@} must be {@{modified from that in standard Cartesian systems}@}, and {@{many standard formulas \(such as the Pythagorean formula for the distance\) do not hold}@} \(see {@{[affine plane](affine%20plane.md)}@}\).

## notations and conventions

{@{The Cartesian coordinates of a point}@} are usually {@{written in [parentheses](parentheses.md#parentheses) and separated by commas, as in \(10, 5\) or \(3, 5, 7\)}@}. {@{The origin}@} is often {@{labelled with the capital letter _O_}@}. In {@{analytic geometry}@}, {@{unknown or generic coordinates}@} are often {@{denoted by the letters \(_x_, _y_\) in the plane, and \(_x_, _y_, _z_\) in three-dimensional space}@}. This custom comes from {@{a convention of algebra}@}, which {@{uses letters near the end of the alphabet for unknown values \(such as the coordinates of points in many geometric problems\)}@}, and {@{letters near the beginning for given quantities}@}.

{@{These conventional names}@} are often {@{used in other domains}@}, such as {@{physics and engineering}@}, although {@{other letters may be used}@}. For example, in {@{a graph showing how a [pressure](pressure.md) varies with [time](time.md)}@}, {@{the graph coordinates}@} may be denoted {@{_p_ and _t_}@}. Each axis is usually {@{named after the coordinate which is measured along it}@}; so one says {@{the _x-axis_, the _y-axis_, the _t-axis_, etc.}@}

{@{Another common convention for coordinate naming}@} is to {@{use subscripts}@}, as {@{\(_x_<sub>1</sub>, _x_<sub>2</sub>, ..., _x_<sub>_n_</sub>\) for the _n_ coordinates in an _n_-dimensional space}@}, especially when {@{_n_ is greater than 3 or unspecified}@}. Some authors prefer {@{the numbering \(_x_<sub>0</sub>, _x_<sub>1</sub>, ..., _x_<sub>_n_<!-- markdown separator -->−1</sub>\)}@}. These notations are especially advantageous in {@{[computer programming](computer%20programming.md)}@}: by {@{storing the coordinates of a point as an [array](array%20data%20type.md), instead of a [record](record%20(computer%20science).md)}@}, the [subscript](subscript.md) can {@{serve to index the coordinates}@}.

In {@{mathematical illustrations of two-dimensional Cartesian systems}@}, {@{the first coordinate \(traditionally called the [abscissa](abscissa.md)\)}@} is measured {@{along a [horizontal](horizontal%20plane.md) axis, oriented from left to right}@}. {@{The second coordinate \(the [ordinate](ordinate.md)\)}@} is then measured {@{along a [vertical](vertical%20direction.md) axis, usually oriented from bottom to top}@}. {@{Young children learning the Cartesian system}@}, commonly learn the order to {@{read the values before cementing the _x_-, _y_-, and _z_-axis concepts}@}, by starting with {@{2D mnemonics}@} \(for example, {@{'Walk along the hall then up the stairs'}@} akin to {@{straight across the _x_-axis then up vertically along the _y_-axis}@}\).

{@{Computer graphics and [image processing](image%20processing.md)}@}, however, often {@{use a coordinate system with the _y_-axis oriented downwards on the computer display}@}. This convention developed in {@{the 1960s \(or earlier\)}@} from the way that {@{images were originally stored in [display buffers](framebuffer.md)}@}.

For {@{three-dimensional systems}@}, a convention is to {@{portray the _xy_-plane horizontally, with the _z_-axis added to represent height \(positive up\)}@}. Furthermore, there is a convention to {@{orient the _x_-axis toward the viewer, biased either to the right or left}@}. If {@{a diagram \([3D projection](3D%20projection.md) or [2D perspective drawing](perspective%20(graphical).md)\)}@} shows {@{the _x_- and _y_-axis horizontally and vertically}@}, respectively, then {@{the _z_-axis should be shown pointing "out of the page" towards the viewer or camera}@}. In such {@{a 2D diagram of a 3D coordinate system}@}, the _z_-axis would appear as {@{a line or ray pointing down and to the left or down and to the right}@}, depending on {@{the presumed viewer or camera [perspective](perspective%20(graphical).md)}@}. In {@{any diagram or display}@}, {@{the orientation of the three axes, as a whole, is arbitrary}@}. However, {@{the orientation of the axes relative to each other}@} should {@{always comply with the [right-hand rule](right-hand%20rule.md), unless specifically stated otherwise}@}. {@{All laws of physics and math}@} assume {@{this [right-handedness](#orientation%20and%20handedness), which ensures consistency}@}.

For 3D diagrams, {@{the names "abscissa" and "ordinate" are rarely used for _x_ and _y_, respectively}@}. When they are, {@{the _z_-coordinate is sometimes called the __applicate__}@}. The words _abscissa_, _ordinate_ and _applicate_ are sometimes used to {@{refer to coordinate axes rather than the coordinate values}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup>

### quadrants and octants

- Main articles: ::@:: [Octant \(solid geometry\)](octant%20(solid%20geometry).md) and [Quadrant \(plane geometry\)](quadrant%20(plane%20geometry).md)

> {@{![The four quadrants of a Cartesian coordinate system](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Cartesian%20coordinates%202D.svg)}@}
>
> {@{The four quadrants of a Cartesian coordinate system}@}

The axes of a two-dimensional Cartesian system {@{divide the plane into four infinite regions, called _quadrants_}@},<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> each {@{bounded by two half-axes}@}. These are often {@{numbered from 1st to 4th and denoted by [Roman numerals](Roman%20numeral.md)}@}: {@{I \(where the coordinates both have positive signs\), II \(where the abscissa is negative − and the ordinate is positive +\)}@}, {@{III \(where both the abscissa and the ordinate are −\), and IV \(abscissa +, ordinate −\)}@}. When {@{the axes are drawn according to the mathematical custom}@}, the numbering {@{goes [counter-clockwise](clockwise.md) starting from the upper right \("north-east"\) quadrant}@}.

Similarly, a three-dimensional Cartesian system defines {@{a division of space into eight regions or __octants__}@},<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> according to {@{the signs of the coordinates of the points}@}. {@{The convention used for naming a specific octant}@} is {@{to list its signs; for example, \(+ + +\) or \(− + −\)}@}. {@{The generalization of the quadrant and octant to an arbitrary number of dimensions}@} is {@{the __[orthant](orthant.md)__}@}, and {@{a similar naming system applies}@}.

## Cartesian formulae for the plane

### distance between two points

{@{The [Euclidean distance](Euclidean%20distance.md)}@} between {@{two points of the plane with Cartesian coordinates $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})$}@} is {@{$$d={\sqrt {(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2} } }.$$}@} This is {@{the Cartesian version of [Pythagoras's theorem](Pythagoras's%20theorem.md)}@}. In {@{three-dimensional space}@}, {@{the distance between points $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2})$}@} is {@{$$d={\sqrt {(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}+(z_{2}-z_{1})^{2} } },$$}@} which can be obtained by {@{two consecutive applications of Pythagoras' theorem}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup>

### Euclidean transformations

{@{The [Euclidean transformations](Euclidean%20plane%20isometry.md) or __Euclidean motions__}@} are {@{the \([bijective](bijective.md)\) mappings of points of the [Euclidean plane](Euclidean%20plane.md) to themselves which preserve distances between points}@}. There are {@{four types of these mappings \(also called isometries\)}@}: {@{[translations](translation%20(geometry).md), [rotations](rotation%20(mathematics).md), [reflections](reflection%20(mathematics).md) and [glide reflections](glide%20reflection.md) (annotation: translation + reflection)}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup>

#### translation

{@{[Translating](translation%20(geometry).md) a set of points of the plane, preserving the distances and directions between them}@}, is equivalent to {@{adding a fixed pair of numbers \(_a_, _b_\) to the Cartesian coordinates of every point in the set}@}. That is, if {@{the original coordinates of a point are \(_x_, _y_\)}@}, after the translation they will be {@{$$(x',y')=(x+a,y+b).$$}@}

#### rotation

To {@{[rotate](rotation%20(geometry).md) a figure [counterclockwise](clockwise.md) around the origin by some angle $\theta$}@} is equivalent to {@{replacing every point with coordinates \(_x_,_y_\) by the point with coordinates \(_x'_,_y'_\)}@}, where {@{$${\begin{aligned}x'&=x\cos \theta -y\sin \theta \\y'&=x\sin \theta +y\cos \theta .\end{aligned} }$$}@} Thus: {@{$$(x',y')=((x\cos \theta -y\sin \theta \,),(x\sin \theta +y\cos \theta \,)).$$}@}

#### reflection

If {@{\(_x_, _y_\) are the Cartesian coordinates of a point}@}, then {@{\(−<!-- markdown separator -->_x_, _y_\)}@} are {@{the coordinates of its [reflection](coordinate%20rotations%20and%20reflections.md) across the second coordinate axis \(the y-axis\)}@}, as if {@{that line were a mirror}@}. Likewise, {@{\(_x_, −<!-- markdown separator -->_y_\)}@} are {@{the coordinates of its reflection across the first coordinate axis \(the x-axis\)}@}. In more generality, {@{reflection across a line through the origin making an angle $\theta$ with the x-axis}@}, is equivalent to {@{replacing every point with coordinates \(_x_, _y_\) by the point with coordinates \(_x_<!-- markdown separator -->′,_y_<!-- markdown separator -->′\)}@}, where {@{$${\begin{aligned}x'&=x\cos 2\theta +y\sin 2\theta \\y'&=x\sin 2\theta -y\cos 2\theta .\end{aligned} }$$}@} Thus: {@{$$(x',y')=((x\cos 2\theta +y\sin 2\theta \,),(x\sin 2\theta -y\cos 2\theta \,)).$$}@}

#### glide reflection

{@{A glide reflection}@} is {@{the composition of a reflection across a line followed by a translation in the direction of that line}@}. It can be seen that {@{the order of these operations does not matter}@} \({@{the translation can come first, followed by the reflection}@}\).

#### general matrix form of the transformations

{@{All [affine transformations](affine%20transformation.md) of the plane}@} can be described {@{in a uniform way by using matrices}@}. For this purpose, {@{the coordinates $(x,y)$ of a point}@} are commonly represented as {@{the [column matrix](column%20matrix.md) ${\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix} }$}@}. {@{The result $(x',y')$ of applying an affine transformation to a point $(x,y)$}@} is given by {@{the formula $${\begin{pmatrix}x'\\y'\end{pmatrix} }=A{\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix} }+b,$$}@} where {@{$$A={\begin{pmatrix}A_{1,1}&A_{1,2}\\A_{2,1}&A_{2,2}\end{pmatrix} }$$ is a 2×2 [matrix](square%20matrix.md) and $b={\begin{pmatrix}b_{1}\\b_{2}\end{pmatrix} }$ is a column matrix}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> That is, {@{$${\begin{aligned}x'&=xA_{1,1}+yA_{1,1}+b_{1}\\y'&=xA_{2,1}+yA_{2,2}+b_{2}.\end{aligned} }$$}@}

Among {@{the affine transformations}@}, {@{the [Euclidean transformations](euclidean%20transformation.md)}@} are characterized by the fact that {@{the matrix $A$ is [orthogonal](orthogonal%20matrix.md)}@}; that is, {@{its columns are [orthogonal vectors](orthogonal%20vectors.md#orthogonal%20vectors) of [Euclidean norm](Euclidean%20norm.md#Euclidean%20norm) one}@}, or, explicitly, {@{$$A_{1,1}A_{1,2}+A_{2,1}A_{2,2}=0$$ and $$A_{1,1}^{2}+A_{2,1}^{2}=A_{1,2}^{2}+A_{2,2}^{2}=1.$$}@} This is equivalent to saying that {@{_A_ times its [transpose](transpose.md) is the [identity matrix](identity%20matrix.md)}@}. If {@{these conditions do not hold}@}, the formula describes {@{a more general [affine transformation](affine%20transformation.md)}@}.

{@{The transformation is a translation}@} {@{[if and only if](if%20and%20only%20if.md) _A_ is the [identity matrix](identity%20matrix.md)}@}. {@{The transformation is a rotation around some point}@} {@{if and only if _A_ is a [rotation matrix](rotation%20matrix.md)}@}, meaning that it is {@{orthogonal and $$A_{1,1}A_{2,2}-A_{2,1}A_{1,2}=1.$$ (annotation: determinant is 1)}@} {@{A reflection or glide reflection}@} is obtained when, {@{$$A_{1,1}A_{2,2}-A_{2,1}A_{1,2}=-1.$$ (annotation: determinant is −1)}@}

Assuming that {@{translations are not used \(that is, $b_{1}=b_{2}=0$\)}@} transformations can be {@{[composed](function%20composition.md) by simply multiplying the associated transformation matrices}@}. In the general case, it is useful to {@{use the [augmented matrix](augmented%20matrix.md) of the transformation}@}; that is, to {@{rewrite the transformation formula $${\begin{pmatrix}x'\\y'\\1\end{pmatrix} }=A'{\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\1\end{pmatrix} },$$}@} where {@{$$A'={\begin{pmatrix}A_{1,1}&A_{1,2}&b_{1}\\A_{2,1}&A_{2,2}&b_{2}\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix} }.$$}@} With this trick, {@{the composition of affine transformations}@} is obtained by {@{multiplying the augmented matrices}@}.

### affine transformation

>
> Effect of {@{applying various 2D affine transformation matrices on a unit square}@} \(reflections are {@{special cases of scaling}@}\)

{@{[Affine transformations](affine%20transformation.md) of the [Euclidean plane](Euclidean%20plane.md)}@} are {@{transformations that map lines to lines, but may change distances and angles}@}. As said in the preceding section, they can be represented with {@{augmented matrices: $${\begin{pmatrix}A_{1,1}&A_{2,1}&b_{1}\\A_{1,2}&A_{2,2}&b_{2}\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix} }{\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\1\end{pmatrix} }={\begin{pmatrix}x'\\y'\\1\end{pmatrix} }.$$}@} {@{The Euclidean transformations}@} are {@{the affine transformations such that the 2×2 matrix of the $A_{i,j}$ is [orthogonal](orthogonal%20matrix.md)}@}.

{@{The augmented matrix that represents the [composition](function%20composition.md) of two affine transformations}@} is obtained by {@{multiplying their augmented matrices}@}.

{@{Some affine transformations that are not Euclidean transformations}@} have {@{received specific names}@}.

#### scaling

An example of {@{an affine transformation which is not Euclidean}@} is given by {@{scaling}@}. To {@{make a figure larger or smaller}@} is equivalent to {@{multiplying the Cartesian coordinates of every point by the same positive number _m_}@}. If {@{\(_x_, _y_\) are the coordinates of a point on the original figure}@}, the corresponding point on the scaled figure has {@{coordinates $$(x',y')=(mx,my).$$}@} If {@{_m_ is greater than 1}@}, {@{the figure becomes larger}@}; {@{if _m_ is between 0 and 1, it becomes smaller}@}.

#### shearing

{@{A [shearing transformation](shear%20mapping.md)}@} will {@{push the top of a square sideways to form a parallelogram}@}. {@{Horizontal shearing}@} is defined by: {@{$$(x',y')=(x+ys,y)$$}@} Shearing can {@{also be applied vertically}@}: {@{$$(x',y')=(x,xs+y)$$}@}

## orientation and handedness

- Main article: ::@:: [Orientability](orientability.md)
- See also: ::@:: [Right-hand rule](right-hand%20rule.md) and [Axes conventions](axes%20conventions.md)

### in two dimensions

> {@{![The [right-hand rule](right-hand%20rule.md)](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Rechte-hand-regel.jpg)}@}
>
> {@{The [right-hand rule](right-hand%20rule.md)}@}

{@{Fixing or choosing the _x_-axis}@} {@{determines the _y_-axis up to direction}@}. Namely, the _y_-axis is {@{necessarily the [perpendicular](perpendicular.md) to the _x_-axis through the point marked 0 on the _x_-axis}@}. But there is {@{a choice of which of the two half lines on the perpendicular to designate as positive and which as negative}@}. Each of these two choices determines {@{a different orientation \(also called _handedness_\) of the Cartesian plane}@}.

The usual way of orienting the plane, with {@{the positive _x_-axis pointing right and the positive _y_-axis pointing up \(and the _x_-axis being the "first" and the _y_-axis the "second" axis\)}@}, is considered {@{the _positive_ or _standard_ orientation, also called the _right-handed_ orientation}@}.

{@{A commonly used mnemonic for defining the positive orientation}@} is {@{the _[right-hand rule](right-hand%20rule.md)_}@}. Placing {@{a somewhat closed right hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up}@}, the fingers {@{point from the _x_-axis to the _y_-axis, in a positively oriented coordinate system}@}.

{@{The other way of orienting the plane}@} is {@{following the _left-hand rule_}@}, {@{placing the left hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up}@}.

When {@{pointing the thumb away from the origin along an axis towards positive}@}, {@{the curvature of the fingers}@} indicates {@{a positive rotation along that axis}@}.

Regardless of {@{the rule used to orient the plane}@}, {@{rotating the coordinate system will preserve the orientation}@}. {@{Switching any one axis}@} will {@{reverse the orientation}@}, but {@{switching both will leave the orientation unchanged}@}.

### in three dimensions

> {@{![Fig. 7 – The left-handed orientation is shown on the left, and the right-handed on the right.](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Cartesian%20coordinate%20system%20handedness.svg)}@}
>
> Fig. 7 – {@{The left-handed orientation is shown on the left, and the right-handed on the right}@}.

<!-- markdownlint MD028 -->

> {@{![Fig. 8 – The right-handed Cartesian coordinate system indicating the coordinate planes](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/Right%20hand%20cartesian.svg)}@}
>
> Fig. 8 – {@{The right-handed Cartesian coordinate system indicating the coordinate planes}@}

Once {@{the _x_- and _y_-axes are specified}@}, they {@{determine the [line](line%20(geometry).md) along which the _z_-axis should lie}@}, but {@{there are two possible orientations for this line}@}. The two possible coordinate systems, which result are called {@{'right-handed' and 'left-handed'}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> The standard orientation, where {@{the _xy_-plane is horizontal and the _z_-axis points up}@} \(and the _x_- and the _y_-axis form {@{a positively oriented two-dimensional coordinate system in the _xy_-plane if observed from _above_ the _xy_-plane}@}\) is called {@{__right-handed__ or __positive__}@}.

> {@{![3D Cartesian coordinate handedness](../../archives/Wikimedia%20Commons/3D%20Cartesian%20Coodinate%20Handedness.jpg)}@}
>
> {@{3D Cartesian coordinate handedness}@}

The name derives from {@{the [right-hand rule](right-hand%20rule.md)}@}. If {@{the [index finger](index%20finger.md) of the right hand is pointed forward}@}, {@{the [middle finger](middle%20finger.md) bent inward at a right angle to it}@}, and {@{the [thumb](thumb.md) placed at a right angle to both}@}, the three fingers {@{indicate the relative orientation of the _x_-, _y_-, and _z_-axes in a _right-handed_ system}@}. The thumb indicates {@{the _x_-axis}@}, {@{the index finger the _y_-axis and the middle finger the _z_-axis}@}. Conversely, if {@{the same is done with the left hand}@}, {@{a left-handed system results}@}.

Figure 7 depicts {@{a left and a right-handed coordinate system}@}. Because {@{a three-dimensional object is represented on the two-dimensional screen}@}, {@{distortion and ambiguity result}@}. {@{The axis pointing downward \(and to the right\)}@} is {@{also meant to point _towards_ the observer}@}, whereas {@{the "middle"-axis is meant to point _away_ from the observer}@}. The red circle is {@{_parallel_ to the horizontal _xy_-plane}@} and indicates {@{rotation from the _x_-axis to the _y_-axis \(in both cases\)}@}. Hence the red arrow {@{passes _in front of_ the _z_-axis}@}.

Figure 8 is {@{another attempt at depicting a right-handed coordinate system}@}. Again, there is {@{an ambiguity caused by projecting the three-dimensional coordinate system into the plane}@}. Many observers see Figure 8 as {@{"flipping in and out" between a [convex](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/convex) cube and a [concave](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/concave) "corner"}@}. This corresponds to {@{the two possible orientations of the space}@}. {@{Seeing the figure as convex}@} gives {@{a left-handed coordinate system}@}. Thus {@{the "correct" way to view Figure 8}@} is to {@{imagine the _x_-axis as pointing _towards_ the observer and thus seeing a concave corner}@}.

## representing a vector in the standard basis

{@{A point in space in a Cartesian coordinate system}@} may also be represented by {@{a position [vector](Euclidean%20vector.md)}@}, which can be thought of as {@{an arrow pointing from the origin of the coordinate system to the point}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> If {@{the coordinates represent spatial positions \(displacements\)}@}, it is common to represent {@{the vector from the origin to the point of interest}@} as {@{$\mathbf {r}$}@}. In {@{two dimensions}@}, {@{the vector from the origin to the point with Cartesian coordinates \(x, y\)}@} can be written as: {@{$$\mathbf {r} =x\mathbf {i} +y\mathbf {j} ,$$}@} where {@{$\mathbf {i} ={\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix} }$ and $\mathbf {j} ={\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\end{pmatrix} }$}@} are {@{[unit vectors](unit%20vectors.md) in the direction of the _x_-axis and _y_-axis respectively}@}, generally referred to as {@{the _[standard basis](standard%20basis.md)_}@} \(in some application areas these may also be referred to as {@{[versors](versor.md)}@}\). Similarly, in {@{three dimensions}@}, {@{the vector from the origin to the point with Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$}@} can be written as:<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> {@{$$\mathbf {r} =x\mathbf {i} +y\mathbf {j} +z\mathbf {k} ,$$}@} where {@{$\mathbf {i} ={\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix} }$, $\mathbf {j} ={\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix} }$, and $\mathbf {k} ={\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix} }$}@}.

There is no {@{_natural_ interpretation of multiplying vectors to obtain another vector that works in all dimensions}@}, however there is a way to {@{use [complex numbers](complex%20number.md) to provide such a multiplication}@}. In {@{a two-dimensional cartesian plane}@}, identify {@{the point with coordinates \(_x_, _y_\) with the complex number _z_ = _x_ + _iy_}@}. Here, {@{_i_ is the [imaginary unit](imaginary%20unit.md) and is identified with the point with coordinates \(0, 1\)}@}, so it is {@{_not_ the unit vector in the direction of the _x_-axis}@}. Since {@{the complex numbers can be multiplied giving another complex number}@}, this identification provides {@{a means to "multiply" vectors}@}. In {@{a three-dimensional cartesian space}@} a similar identification can be made with {@{a subset of the [quaternions](quaternion.md)}@}.
