# microeconomics

__Microeconomics__ is {@{a branch of [economics](economics.md)}@} that studies {@{the behavior of individuals and [firms](theory%20of%20the%20firm.md) in making decisions regarding the allocation of [scarce resources](scarcity.md) and the interactions among these individuals and firms}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> Microeconomics focuses on {@{the study of individual markets, sectors, or industries as opposed to the economy as a whole, which is studied in [macroeconomics](macroeconomics.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-03-02,1259,350!2027-08-23,808,330!2029-02-21,1252,350-->

One goal of microeconomics is to analyze {@{the [market mechanisms](market%20mechanism.md) that establish [relative prices](relative%20price.md) among goods and services and allocate limited resources among alternative uses}@}. Microeconomics shows {@{conditions under which free markets lead to desirable allocations}@}. It also analyzes {@{[market failure](market%20failure.md), where markets fail to produce [efficient](economic%20efficiency.md) results}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-03-26,399,310!2028-11-02,1166,350!2029-10-31,1449,350-->

While microeconomics {@{focuses on firms and individuals}@}, macroeconomics {@{focuses on the total of economic activity}@}, dealing with {@{the issues of [growth](economic%20growth.md), [inflation](inflation.md), and [unemployment](unemployment.md)—and with national policies relating to these issues}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> Microeconomics also deals with {@{the effects of economic policies (such as changing [taxation](tax.md) levels) on microeconomic behavior and thus on the aforementioned aspects of the economy}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> Particularly {@{in the wake of the [Lucas critique](Lucas%20critique.md)}@}, much of modern macroeconomic theories has been built {@{upon [microfoundations](microfoundations.md)—i.e., based upon basic assumptions about micro-level behavior}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-14,1101,350!2026-08-30,537,330!2028-02-03,935,330!2028-01-03,905,330!2025-12-19,299,290!2029-02-23,1253,350-->

## assumptions and definitions

Microeconomic study historically {@{has been performed according to general equilibrium theory}@}, developed by Léon Walras in _Elements of Pure Economics_ (1874) and partial equilibrium theory, introduced by Alfred Marshall in _Principles of Economics_ (1890).<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-07-17,1367,350-->

Microeconomic theory typically begins with {@{the study of a single rational and [utility maximizing](utility%20maximization%20problem.md) individual}@}. To economists, {@{[rationality](rationality.md)}@} means {@{an individual possesses stable [preferences](preference%20(economics).md) that are both [complete](preference%20(economics).md#types%20of%20preferences) and [transitive](transitive%20relation.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-10-08,1145,350!2026-10-26,581,330!2028-11-05,1113,310-->

{@{The [technical](mathematical%20economics.md) assumption that preference relations are [continuous](continuous%20function.md)}@} is needed to {@{ensure the existence of a [utility function](utility.md#quantifying%20utility)}@}. Although {@{microeconomic theory can continue without this assumption}@}, it would make {@{[comparative statics](comparative%20statics.md) impossible since there is no guarantee that the resulting utility function would be [differentiable](differentiable%20function.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-24,809,330!2026-05-29,456,310!2029-11-14,1461,350!2027-06-24,751,330-->

Microeconomic theory progresses by {@{defining a [competitive budget set](budget%20set.md) which is a subset of the [consumption set](consumer%20choice.md)}@}. It is at this point that economists {@{make the technical assumption that preferences are [locally non-satiated](local%20nonsatiation.md)}@}. Without the assumption of LNS (local non-satiation) there is {@{no 100% guarantee but there would be a rational rise in individual [utility](utility.md)}@}. With the necessary tools and assumptions in place {@{the [utility maximization problem (UMP)](utility%20maximization%20problem.md)}@} is developed. <!--SR:!2026-02-24,311,250!2027-02-17,668,330!2027-09-09,819,330!2029-07-11,1362,350-->

{@{The utility maximization problem}@} is {@{the heart of [consumer theory](consumer%20choice.md)}@}. The utility maximization problem attempts to {@{explain the [action axiom](action%20axiom.md)}@} by {@{imposing rationality axioms on consumer preferences and then mathematically modeling and analyzing the consequences}@}. The utility maximization problem serves {@{not only as the mathematical foundation of consumer theory but as a [metaphysical](metaphysics.md) explanation of it as well}@}. That is, the utility maximization problem is used by economists to {@{not only explain _what_ or _how_ individuals make choices but _why_ individuals make choices as well}@}. <!--SR:!2028-10-28,1162,350!2028-08-20,1106,350!2029-10-27,1446,350!2026-01-27,345,290!2026-09-13,547,330!2028-06-15,1009,310-->

The utility maximization problem is {@{a [constrained optimization](constrained%20optimization.md) problem in which an individual seeks to maximize utility subject to a [budget constraint](budget%20constraint.md)}@}. Economists {@{use the [extreme value theorem](extreme%20value%20theorem.md) to guarantee that a solution to the utility maximization problem exists}@}. That is, since {@{the [budget constraint](budget%20set.md) is both bounded and closed}@}, {@{a solution to the utility maximization problem exists}@}. Economists call the solution to the utility maximization problem {@{a [Walrasian demand function](marshallian%20demand%20function.md) or correspondence}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-29,1448,350!2028-09-19,1128,350!2029-03-20,1274,350!2029-11-09,1457,350!2026-12-27,582,290-->

The utility maximization problem has so far been developed by {@{taking consumer tastes (i.e. consumer utility) as primitive}@}. However, an alternative way to develop microeconomic theory is by {@{taking consumer choice as primitive}@}. This model of microeconomic theory is referred to as {@{[revealed preference](revealed%20preference.md) theory}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-22,1442,350!2028-10-07,1145,350!2026-03-21,402,310-->

{@{The theory of [supply and demand](supply%20and%20demand.md)}@} usually assumes that {@{markets are [perfectly competitive](perfect%20competition.md)}@}. This implies that {@{there are many buyers and sellers in the market}@} and {@{none of them have the capacity to significantly influence prices of goods and services}@}. In {@{many real-life transactions}@}, {@{the assumption fails because some individual buyers or sellers have the ability to influence prices}@}. Quite often, {@{a sophisticated analysis}@} is required to {@{understand the demand-supply equation of a good model}@}. However, the theory {@{works well in situations meeting these assumptions}@}. <!--SR:!2029-07-16,1366,350!2029-11-14,1461,350!2027-11-07,815,330!2029-10-18,1438,350!2028-11-01,1165,350!2028-08-31,1115,350!2028-01-25,914,330!2029-03-06,1262,350!2026-01-08,119,388-->

[Mainstream economics](mainstream%20economics.md) does not {@{assume _a priori_ that markets are preferable to other forms of social organization}@}. In fact, much analysis is devoted to {@{cases where [market failures](market%20failure.md) lead to [resource allocation](resource%20allocation.md) that is suboptimal and creates [deadweight loss](deadweight%20loss.md)}@}. {@{A classic example of suboptimal resource allocation}@} is {@{that of a [public good](public%20good%20(economics).md)}@}. In such cases, [economists](economist.md) may {@{attempt to find policies that avoid waste}@}, either {@{directly by government control}@}, {@{indirectly by regulation}@} that induces {@{market participants to act in a manner consistent with optimal welfare}@}, or by creating {@{"[missing markets](missing%20market.md)" to enable efficient trading where none had previously existed}@}. <!--SR:!2029-11-07,1455,350!2028-09-23,1131,350!2029-06-19,1344,350!2028-08-11,1098,350!2029-10-23,1443,350!2028-09-18,1043,330!2027-05-30,742,330!2026-04-06,121,398!2026-04-17,131,398-->

This is studied in the field of {@{[collective action](collective%20action.md) and [public choice theory](public%20choice.md)}@}. {@{"Optimal welfare"}@} usually takes on {@{a [Paretian](pareto%20efficiency.md) norm, which is a mathematical application of the [Kaldor–Hicks method](Kaldor–Hicks%20efficiency.md)}@}. This can {@{diverge from the [Utilitarian](utilitarianism.md) goal of maximizing [utility](utility.md)}@} because {@{it does not consider the distribution of goods between people}@}. {@{Market failure in positive economics (microeconomics)}@} is {@{limited in implications without mixing the belief of the economist and their theory}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-21,1107,350!2028-07-05,1068,350!2026-02-12,357,290!2026-12-17,618,330!2028-10-11,1148,350!2028-09-19,1129,350!2028-08-06,1095,350-->

{@{The demand for various commodities by individuals}@} is {@{generally thought of as the outcome of a utility-maximizing process}@}, with {@{each individual trying to maximize their own utility under a [budget constraint](budget%20constraint.md) and a given consumption set}@}. <!--SR:!2029-06-29,1352,350!2026-11-29,604,330!2027-11-10,858,330-->

### allocation of scarce resources

Individuals and firms need to {@{allocate limited resources to ensure all __agents__ in the economy are well off}@}. Firms decide {@{which goods and services to produce considering low costs}@} involving {@{labor, materials and capital as well as potential profit margins}@}. Consumers choose {@{the good and services they want that will maximize their happiness}@} taking into account {@{their limited wealth}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-01-31,1234,350!2026-03-02,135,270!2028-07-21,1082,350!2026-01-15,71,376!2026-04-02,131,397-->

The government can {@{make these allocation decisions or they can be independently made by the consumers and firms}@}. For example, in the former Soviet Union, the government {@{played a part in informing car manufacturers which cars to produce and which consumers will gain access to a car}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2029-05-18,1317,350!2026-08-25,483,310-->

## history

- see: [history of microeconomics](history%20of%20microeconomics.md)

Economists commonly {@{consider themselves microeconomists or macroeconomists}@}. The difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics likely was {@{introduced in 1933 by the Norwegian economist [Ragnar Frisch](Ragnar%20Frisch.md)}@}, the co-recipient of the first [Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences](Nobel%20Memorial%20Prize%20in%20Economic%20Sciences.md) in 1969.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup><sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> However, Frisch {@{did not actually use the word "microeconomics"}@}, instead {@{drawing distinctions between "micro-dynamic" and "macro-dynamic" analysis}@} in a way {@{similar to how the words "microeconomics" and "macroeconomics" are used today}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup><sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> The first known use of the term "microeconomics" in a published article was {@{from Pieter de Wolff in 1941}@}, who {@{broadened the term "micro-dynamics" into "microeconomics"}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup><sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-07-07,1071,350!2026-03-04,390,310!2028-10-06,1144,350!2028-08-12,1099,350!2029-10-28,1447,350!2027-04-01,645,290!2026-01-06,117,388-->

## microeconomic theory

### consumer demand theory

- see: [consumer choice](consumer%20choice.md)

Consumer demand theory {@{relates [preferences](preference%20(economics).md) for the consumption of both [goods](goods.md) and services to the consumption expenditures}@}; ultimately, {@{this relationship between preferences and consumption expenditures}@} is used to {@{relate preferences to [consumer demand curves](supply%20and%20demand.md)}@}. {@{The link between personal preferences, consumption and the [demand curve](demand%20curve.md)}@} is {@{one of the most closely studied relations in economics}@}. It is a way of analyzing {@{how consumers may achieve [equilibrium](economic%20equilibrium.md)}@} between {@{preferences and expenditures}@} by maximizing {@{[utility](utility.md) subject to consumer [budget constraints](budget%20constraint.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-03-22,1276,350!2026-11-09,590,330!2028-08-20,1107,350!2026-01-07,349,310!2028-09-21,1131,350!2028-09-19,1043,330!2028-04-02,921,330!2026-04-16,130,398-->

### production theory

- see: [production theory](production%20(economics).md)

Production theory is {@{the study of production, or the economic process of converting inputs into outputs}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> [Production](production%20(economics).md) {@{uses [resources](resource.md) to create a [good](goods.md) or [service](service%20(economics).md) that is suitable for use}@}, {@{[gift](gift.md)-giving in a [gift economy](gift%20economy.md), or [exchange](trade.md) in a [market economy](market%20economy.md)}@}. This can include {@{[manufacturing](manufacturing.md), storing, [shipping](freight%20transport.md), and [packaging](packaging.md)}@}. Some economists define production {@{broadly as all economic activity other than [consumption](consumption%20(economics).md)}@}. They see {@{every commercial activity other than the final purchase as some form of production}@}. <!--SR:!2029-02-01,1235,350!2029-11-01,1450,350!2027-07-30,778,330!2028-10-10,1147,350!2029-11-10,1458,350!2029-03-26,1278,350-->

### cost-of-production theory of value

- see: [cost-of-production theory of value](cost-of-production%20theory%20of%20value.md)

The cost-of-production theory of value states that {@{the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it}@}. The cost can {@{comprise any of the [factors of production](factors%20of%20production.md) (including [labor](wage%20labour.md), [capital](capital%20(economics).md), or [land](land%20(economics).md)) and taxation}@}. [Technology](technology.md) can be viewed either as {@{a form of [fixed capital](fixed%20capital.md) (e.g. an [industrial plant](physical%20plant.md)) or [circulating capital](circulating%20capital.md) (e.g. [intermediate goods](intermediate%20good.md))}@}. <!--SR:!2028-09-05,1119,350!2026-04-06,415,310!2027-06-17,759,330-->

In {@{the mathematical model for the cost of production}@}, {@{the short-run total cost}@} is {@{equal to [fixed cost](fixed%20cost.md) plus total [variable cost](variable%20cost.md)}@}. The fixed cost refers to {@{the cost that is incurred regardless of how much the firm produces}@}. The variable cost is {@{a function of the quantity of an object being produced}@}. The cost function can be used to {@{characterize production through the duality theory in economics}@}, developed mainly by [Ronald Shephard](Ronald%20Shephard.md) (1953, 1970) and other scholars (Sickles & Zelenyuk, 2019, ch. 2). <!--SR:!2027-10-08,842,330!2026-10-31,560,310!2029-02-08,1241,350!2029-02-02,1235,350!2027-09-17,827,330!2028-01-10,902,330-->

### fixed and variable costs

- [fixed cost](fixed%20cost.md) (FC) ::@:: This cost does not change with output. It includes business expenses such as rent, salaries and utility bills. <!--SR:!2027-09-05,815,330!2029-01-28,1231,350-->
- [variable cost](variable%20cost.md) (VC) ::@:: This cost changes as output changes. This includes raw materials, delivery costs and production supplies. <!--SR:!2028-09-06,1121,350!2029-03-08,1264,350-->

Over {@{a short time period (few months)}@}, most costs are {@{fixed costs as the firm will have to pay for salaries, contracted shipment and materials used to produce various goods}@}. Over {@{a longer time period (2-3 years)}@}, costs can {@{become variable}@}. Firms can {@{decide to reduce output, purchase fewer materials and even sell some machinery}@}. Over {@{10 years}@}, {@{most costs become variable}@} as {@{workers can be laid off or new machinery can be bought to replace the old machinery}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-09-10,1124,350!2029-02-24,1254,350!2029-11-13,1460,350!2028-08-30,1115,350!2028-08-09,1098,350!2028-08-29,1114,350!2029-11-12,1459,350!2026-04-19,129,400-->

- [sunk costs](sunk%20cost.md) ::@:: This is a fixed cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. An example of this can be in R&D development like in the pharmaceutical industry. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent to achieve new drug breakthroughs but this is challenging as its increasingly harder to find new breakthroughs and meet tighter regulation standards. Thus many projects are written off leading to losses of millions of dollars.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> <!--SR:!2028-02-09,926,330!2027-02-02,625,310-->

### opportunity cost

- see: [opportunity cost](opportunity%20cost.md)

Opportunity cost is {@{closely related to the idea of time constraints}@}. One can {@{do only one thing at a time}@}, which means that, {@{inevitably, one is always giving up other things}@}. The opportunity cost of any activity is {@{the value of the next-best alternative thing one may have done instead}@}. Opportunity cost {@{depends only on the value of the next-best alternative}@}. It does not matter whether {@{one has five alternatives or 5&nbsp;000}@}. <!--SR:!2028-10-14,1150,350!2029-10-21,1441,350!2028-07-22,1083,350!2029-02-16,1248,350!2026-03-19,152,310!2026-03-19,124,396-->

Opportunity costs can {@{tell when _not_ to do something as well as when to do something}@}. For example, one {@{may like waffles, but like chocolate even more}@}. If {@{someone offers only waffles, one would take it}@}. But if {@{offered waffles or chocolate, one would take the chocolate}@}. The opportunity cost of eating waffles is {@{sacrificing the chance to eat chocolate}@}. Because {@{the cost of not eating the chocolate is higher than the benefits of eating the waffles}@}, {@{it makes no sense to choose waffles}@}. Of course, if {@{one chooses chocolate, they are still faced with the opportunity cost of giving up having waffles}@}. But one is willing to do that because {@{the waffle's opportunity cost is lower than the benefits of the chocolate}@}. Opportunity costs are {@{unavoidable constraints on behavior}@} because {@{one has to decide what's best and give up the next-best alternative}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-31,1116,350!2028-07-11,1073,350!2029-03-27,1280,350!2029-10-30,1449,350!2029-10-07,1429,350!2028-01-04,897,330!2029-06-08,1335,350!2029-04-28,1300,350!2029-11-05,1454,350!2029-02-10,1242,350!2028-08-01,1091,350-->

### price theory

Microeconomics is also known as {@{price theory}@} to {@{highlight the significance of prices in relation to buyer and sellers as these agents determine prices due to their individual actions}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> Price theory is {@{a field of [economics](economics.md)}@} that {@{uses the [supply and demand](supply%20and%20demand.md) framework to explain and predict human behavior}@}. It is associated with {@{the [Chicago School of Economics](chicago%20school%20of%20economics.md)}@}. Price theory studies {@{[competitive equilibrium](competitive%20equilibrium.md) in [markets](market%20(economics).md) to yield testable hypotheses that can be rejected}@}. <!--SR:!2029-01-22,1226,350!2028-01-29,931,330!2028-10-31,1164,350!2029-01-21,1226,350!2028-07-12,1074,350!2028-01-21,910,330-->

Price theory is {@{not the same as microeconomics}@}. {@{Strategic behavior, such as the interactions among sellers in a market where they are few}@}, is {@{a significant part of microeconomics but is not emphasized in price theory}@}. Price theorists {@{focus on competition believing it to be a reasonable description of most markets}@} that leaves room to {@{study additional aspects of tastes and technology}@}. As a result, price theory tends to {@{use less [game theory](game%20theory.md) than microeconomics does}@}. <!--SR:!2028-10-21,1156,350!2028-09-25,1134,350!2027-04-18,712,330!2027-08-31,810,330!2026-03-02,134,270!2028-09-20,1130,350-->

Price theory focuses on {@{how agents respond to prices}@}, but its framework can be {@{applied to a wide variety of socioeconomic issues that might not seem to involve prices at first glance}@}. Price theorists have {@{influenced several other fields including developing [public choice theory](public%20choice.md) and [law and economics](law%20and%20economics.md)}@}. Price theory has been applied to {@{issues previously thought of as outside the purview of economics such as criminal justice, marriage, and addiction}@}. <!--SR:!2026-11-23,601,330!2028-01-09,901,330!2026-03-08,391,310!2027-04-05,699,330-->

## microeconomic models

### supply and demand

- see: [supply and demand](supply%20and%20demand.md)

Supply and demand is {@{an [economic model](economic%20model.md) of [price determination](pricing.md) in a perfectly competitive [market](market%20(economics).md)}@}. It concludes that {@{in a [perfectly competitive market](perfect%20competition.md) with no [externalities](externality.md), [per unit taxes](excise.md), or [price controls](price%20controls.md)}@}, {@{the [unit price](unit%20price.md) for a particular [good](goods.md)}@} is {@{the price at which the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers}@}.

{@{[Prices and quantities](real%20and%20nominal%20value.md)}@} have been described as {@{the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a [market economy](market%20economy.md)}@}.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> The theory of supply and demand is {@{an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed}@}. In microeconomics, it applies to {@{price and output determination for a market with [perfect competition](perfect%20competition.md)}@}, which includes {@{the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting [power](market%20power.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-08,1095,350!2027-04-17,711,330!2027-07-10,758,330!2028-08-02,1092,350!2028-09-26,1135,350-->

For {@{a given market of a [commodity](goods.md)}@}, demand is {@{the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good}@}. Demand is often represented by {@{a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded (as in the figure)}@}. [Demand theory](consumer%20choice.md) describes {@{individual consumers as [rationally](rational%20choice%20theory.md) choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc.}@} A term for this is {@{"constrained utility maximization" (with income and [wealth](wealth.md#economic%20analysis%20of%20wealth%20accumulation) as the [constraints](budget%20constraint.md) on demand)}@}. Here, [utility](utility.md) refers to {@{the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred}@}. <!--SR:!2029-03-14,1269,350!2027-08-07,794,330!2028-10-07,1143,350!2026-10-08,566,330!2027-08-08,795,330!2028-07-01,1023,310-->

The [law of demand](law%20of%20demand.md) states that, {@{in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related}@}. That is, {@{the higher the price of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things [unchanged](ceteris%20paribus.md))}@}. As {@{the price of a commodity falls}@}, consumers {@{move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the [substitution effect](substitution%20effect.md))}@}. In addition, {@{[purchasing power](purchasing%20power.md) from the price decline}@} increases {@{ability to buy}@} \({@{the [income effect](consumer%20choice.md#income%20effect)}@}\). Other factors can {@{change demand}@}; for example an increase in income will {@{shift the demand curve for a [normal good](normal%20good.md) outward relative to the origin}@}. {@{All determinants are predominantly}@} taken as {@{constant factors of demand and supply}@}. <!--SR:!2028-09-11,1125,350!2028-09-01,1117,350!2026-10-24,578,330!2027-10-16,847,330!2026-03-21,153,310!2028-10-27,1161,350!2029-05-10,1311,350!2027-08-14,800,330!2026-01-16,71,376!2026-03-27,131,396!2026-04-02,132,397-->

{@{_Supply_}@} is {@{the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price}@}. It may be represented as {@{a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied}@}. {@{Producers, for example business firms}@}, are {@{hypothesized to be _profit maximizers_}@}, meaning that they attempt to {@{produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit}@}.

That is, {@{the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it producers will supply}@}. The higher price makes {@{it profitable to increase production}@}. Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can {@{shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement}@}. The "Law of Supply" states that, {@{in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply}@}. Here as well, {@{the determinants of supply}@}, such as {@{price of substitutes, cost of production}@}, {@{technology applied and various factors of inputs of production}@} are {@{all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply}@}. <!--SR:!2028-09-12,1126,350!2029-06-02,1330,350!2028-09-18,1128,350!2029-01-26,1230,350!2028-08-19,1105,350!2026-01-28,365,310!2026-01-07,118,388!2026-01-07,118,388-->

[Market equilibrium](economic%20equilibrium.md) occurs {@{where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves}@}. At {@{a price below equilibrium}@}, there is {@{a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded}@}. This is {@{posited to bid the price up}@}. At {@{a price above equilibrium}@}, there is {@{a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded}@}. This {@{pushes the price down}@}. The [model](economic%20model.md) of supply and demand predicts that {@{for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded}@}.

For {@{a given quantity of a consumer good}@}, the point on the demand curve {@{indicates the value, or [marginal utility](marginal%20utility.md), to consumers for that unit}@}.
