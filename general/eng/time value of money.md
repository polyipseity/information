> The present value of {@{\$1,000, 100 years into the future}@}. Curves represent {@{constant discount rates of 2%, 3%, 5%, and 7%}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-04,246,330!2026-01-05,247,330!2025-12-13,227,330-->

{@{The __time value of money__}@} refers to {@{the fact that there is normally a greater benefit to receiving a sum of [money](money.md) now rather than an identical sum later}@}. It may be seen as {@{an implication of the later-developed concept of [time preference](time%20preference.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-16,276,330!2025-12-15,229,330!2026-03-05,293,330-->

The time value of money refers to {@{the observation that it is better to receive money sooner than later}@}. {@{Money you have today}@} can be {@{invested to earn a positive rate of return, producing more money tomorrow}@}. Therefore, {@{a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-28,241,330!2026-03-02,290,330!2026-02-16,276,330!2026-01-07,249,330-->

The [time](time.md) value of money is among {@{the factors considered when weighing the [opportunity costs](opportunity%20cost.md) of spending rather than [saving](saving.md) or [investing](investing.md) money}@}. As such, it is among {@{the reasons why [interest](interest.md) is paid or earned}@}: {@{interest, whether it is on a [bank deposit](bank%20deposit.md) or [debt](debt.md)}@}, {@{compensates the depositor or lender for the loss of their use of their money}@}. Investors are {@{willing to forgo spending their money now only if they expect a favorable net [return](rate%20of%20return.md) on their investment in the future}@}, such that {@{the increased [value](value%20(economics).md) to be available later is sufficiently high to offset both the preference to spending money now and inflation \(if present\)}@}; see {@{[required rate of return](required%20rate%20of%20return.md#discount%20rate)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-21,259,330!2026-01-27,264,330!2025-12-22,235,330!2026-01-28,265,330!2026-02-13,273,330!2025-09-19,159,310!2026-01-25,263,330-->

## history

{@{The [Talmud](Talmud.md) \(~500 CE\)}@} {@{recognizes the time value of money}@}. In {@{Tractate [Makkos](Makkot.md) page 3a}@} the Talmud discusses {@{a case where witnesses falsely claimed that the term of a loan was 30 days when it was actually 10 years}@}. The false witnesses must {@{pay the difference of the value of the loan}@} "{@{in a situation where he would be required to give the money back \(within\) thirty days..., and that same sum in a situation where he would be required to give the money back \(within\) 10 years...}@} The difference is {@{the sum that the testimony of the \(false\) witnesses sought to have the borrower lose}@}; therefore, {@{it is the sum that they must pay}@}."<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-03-06,294,330!2026-01-06,244,330!2026-01-07,245,330!2026-07-09,379,310!2026-03-02,290,330!2026-02-20,280,330!2026-02-23,283,330!2025-12-26,239,330-->

The notion was later described by {@{[Martín de Azpilcueta](Martín%20de%20Azpilcueta.md) \(1491–1586\) of the [School of Salamanca](School%20of%20Salamanca.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-11,126,290-->

## calculations

{@{Time value of money problems}@} involve {@{the net value of cash flows at different points in time}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-24,284,330!2025-12-16,230,330-->

In {@{a typical case}@}, the variables might be: {@{a balance \(the real or nominal value of a debt or a financial asset in terms of monetary units\), a periodic rate of interest, the number of periods, and a series of cash flows}@}. \(In {@{the case of a debt}@}, cash flows are {@{payments against principal and interest}@}; in {@{the case of a financial asset}@}, these are {@{contributions to or withdrawals from the balance}@}.\) More generally, {@{the cash flows may not be periodic but may be specified individually}@}. Any of these variables may be {@{the independent variable \(the sought-for answer\) in a given problem}@}. For example, one may know that: the interest is 0.5% per period \(per month, say\); the number of periods is 60 \(months\); the initial balance \(of the debt, in this case\) is 25,000 units; and the final balance is 0 units. {@{The unknown variable}@} may be {@{the monthly payment that the borrower must pay}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-20,233,330!2026-01-10,248,330!2025-12-19,233,330!2026-01-05,247,330!2026-02-15,275,330!2025-12-29,241,330!2025-10-17,169,310!2026-03-02,290,330!2026-02-18,278,330!2026-01-11,249,330-->

For example, {@{£100 invested for one year, earning 5% interest}@}, will be {@{worth £105 after one year}@}; therefore, {@{£100 paid now _and_ £105 paid exactly one year later}@} {@{_both_ have the same value to a recipient who expects 5% interest assuming that inflation would be zero percent}@}. That is, {@{£100 invested for one year at 5% interest}@} has {@{a _future value_ of £105 under the assumption that inflation would be zero percent}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-16,254,330!2026-01-24,262,330!2026-01-26,263,330!2026-03-06,294,330!2026-01-13,251,330!2026-02-16,276,330-->

This principle allows for {@{the valuation of a likely stream of income in the future}@}, in such a way that {@{annual incomes are [discounted](discounting.md) and then added together}@}, thus {@{providing a lump-sum "present value" of the entire income stream}@}; {@{all of the standard calculations for time value of money}@} derive from {@{the most basic algebraic expression for the [present value](present%20value.md) of a future sum, "discounted" to the present by an amount equal to the time value of money}@}. For example, {@{the future value sum $FV$ to be received in one year}@} is {@{discounted at the rate of interest $r$ to give the present value sum $PV$}@}: {@{$$PV={\frac {FV}{(1+r)} }$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-18,278,330!2026-01-30,267,330!2026-01-18,256,330!2026-02-06,266,330!2025-09-14,155,310!2026-01-07,249,330!2026-02-05,265,330!2025-09-18,158,310-->

Some standard calculations based on the time value of money are:

- {@{_[Present value](present%20value.md)_}@}: {@{The current worth of a future sum of money or stream of [cash flows](cash%20flows.md)}@}, given {@{a specified [rate of return](rate%20of%20return.md)}@}. Future cash flows are {@{"discounted" at the _discount rate_}@}; the higher {@{the discount rate, the lower the present value of the future cash flows}@}. {@{Determining the appropriate discount rate}@} is {@{the key to valuing future cash flows properly, whether they be earnings or obligations}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup>
- {@{_Present value of an [annuity](annuity%20(finance%20theory).md)_}@}: An annuity is {@{a series of equal payments or receipts that occur at evenly spaced intervals}@}. {@{Leases and rental payments}@} are examples. {@{The payments or receipts occur at the end of each period for an ordinary annuity}@} while {@{they occur at the beginning of each period for an annuity due}@}. <p> {@{_Present value of a [perpetuity](perpetuity.md)_}@} is {@{an infinite and constant stream of identical cash flows}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup>
- {@{_[Future value](future%20value.md)_}@}: {@{The value of an asset or cash at a specified date in the future}@}, based on {@{the value of that asset in the present}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup>
- {@{_Future value of an annuity \(FVA\)_}@}: {@{The future value of a stream of payments \(annuity\)}@}, assuming {@{the payments are invested at a given rate of interest}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-23,236,330!2026-01-09,247,330!2026-03-03,291,330!2025-12-23,236,330!2025-12-25,238,330!2026-01-01,244,330!2026-02-18,278,330!2026-01-03,246,330!2026-01-21,259,330!2026-02-13,273,330!2025-12-30,242,330!2025-12-16,230,330!2025-09-27,64,362!2025-10-27,88,362!2026-01-14,252,330!2026-01-24,262,330!2025-10-29,90,362!2026-03-04,292,330!2026-01-31,268,330!2025-09-27,64,362-->

There are {@{several basic equations that represent the equalities listed above}@}. The solutions may be found using {@{\(in most cases\) the formulas, a financial calculator, or a [spreadsheet](spreadsheet.md)}@}. The formulas are programmed into {@{most financial calculators and several spreadsheet functions \(such as PV, FV, RATE, NPER, and PMT\)}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-08,268,330!2026-02-17,277,330!2025-09-20,160,310-->

For {@{any of the equations below}@}, the formula may {@{also be rearranged to determine one of the other unknowns}@}. In {@{the case of the standard annuity formula}@}, there is {@{no closed-form algebraic solution for the interest rate}@} \(although financial calculators and spreadsheet programs can {@{readily determine solutions through rapid trial and error algorithms}@}\). <!--SR:!2026-01-31,268,330!2026-02-23,283,330!2026-02-26,286,330!2025-10-10,175,310!2025-10-19,171,310-->

These equations are {@{frequently combined for particular uses}@}. For example, {@{[bonds](bond%20(finance).md) can be readily priced}@} using these equations. A typical coupon bond is {@{composed of two types of payments}@}: {@{a stream of coupon payments similar to an annuity, and a lump-sum [return of capital](return%20of%20capital.md) at the end of the bond's [maturity](maturity%20(finance).md)—that is, a future payment}@}. {@{The two formulas can be combined}@} to {@{determine the present value of the bond}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-05,293,330!2026-01-29,266,330!2026-03-04,292,330!2026-01-30,267,330!2026-03-03,291,330!2026-02-21,281,330-->

An important note is that {@{the interest rate _i_ is the interest rate for the relevant period}@}. For {@{an annuity that makes one payment per year}@}, _i_ will be {@{the annual interest rate}@}. For {@{an income or payment stream with a different payment schedule}@}, the interest rate must be {@{converted into the relevant periodic interest rate}@}. For example, {@{a monthly rate for a mortgage with monthly payments}@} requires that {@{the interest rate be divided by 12}@} \(see the example below\). See [compound interest](compound%20interest.md) for {@{details on converting between different periodic interest rates}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-21,259,330!2026-02-10,270,330!2026-01-09,251,330!2025-12-14,228,330!2026-02-27,287,330!2026-02-16,276,330!2025-12-13,227,330!2025-12-13,227,330-->

{@{The rate of return in the calculations}@} can be {@{either the variable solved for, or a predefined variable}@} that {@{measures a discount rate, interest, inflation, rate of return, cost of equity, cost of debt or any number of other analogous concepts}@}. {@{The choice of the appropriate rate}@} is {@{critical to the exercise}@}, and {@{the use of an incorrect discount rate will make the results meaningless}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-16,276,330!2026-02-08,268,330!2026-02-19,279,330!2026-01-24,262,330!2026-02-07,267,330!2026-03-06,294,330-->

For {@{calculations involving annuities}@}, it must be decided {@{whether the payments are made at the end of each period \(known as an ordinary annuity\), or at the beginning of each period \(known as an annuity due\)}@}. When {@{using a financial calculator or a [spreadsheet](spreadsheet.md)}@}, it can {@{usually be set for either calculation}@}. The following formulas are {@{for an ordinary annuity}@}. For {@{the answer to the present value of an annuity due}@}, {@{the PV of an ordinary annuity can be multiplied by \(1 + _i_\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-23,261,330!2025-10-11,176,310!2025-11-02,191,310!2026-02-10,270,330!2025-12-18,232,330!2026-03-01,289,330!2026-03-02,290,330-->

## formula

The following formula use these common variables:

- _PV_ ::@:: is the value at time zero \(present value\) <!--SR:!2025-12-23,235,330!2026-01-12,250,330-->
- _FV_ ::@:: is the value at time _n_ \(future value\) <!--SR:!2026-01-25,263,330!2026-01-08,246,330-->
- _A_ ::@:: is the value of the individual payments in each compounding period <!--SR:!2026-02-28,288,330!2025-12-28,240,330-->
- _n_ ::@:: is the number of periods \(not necessarily an integer\) <!--SR:!2026-03-06,294,330!2026-01-15,253,330-->
- _i_ ::@:: is the [interest rate](interest%20rate.md) at which the amount compounds each period <!--SR:!2026-01-12,250,330!2026-02-21,281,330-->
- _g_ ::@:: is the growing rate of payments over each time period <!--SR:!2026-01-08,250,330!2026-03-01,289,330-->

### future value of a present sum

{@{The [future value](future%20value.md) \(_FV_\) formula}@} is {@{similar and uses the same variables}@}. {@{$$FV\ =\ PV\cdot (1+i)^{n}$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-01-06,244,330!2026-02-15,275,330!2025-12-26,238,330-->

### present value of a future sum

{@{The present value formula}@} is {@{the core formula for the time value of money}@}; {@{each of the other formulas is derived from this formula}@}. For example, {@{the annuity formula is the sum of a series of present value calculations}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-27,287,330!2026-02-06,266,330!2026-02-16,276,330!2025-12-25,237,330-->

The [present value](present%20value.md) \(_PV_\) formula has {@{four variables}@}, each of which can be {@{solved for by [numerical methods](numerical%20methods.md)}@}: {@{$$PV\ =\ {\frac {FV}{(1+i)^{n} } }$$}@} <!--SR:!2025-12-24,237,330!2026-02-11,271,330!2026-01-18,256,330-->

{@{The cumulative present value of future cash flows}@} can be calculated by {@{summing the contributions of _FV<sub>t</sub>_, the value of cash flow at time _t_}@}: {@{$$PV\ =\ \sum _{t=1}^{n}{\frac {FV_{t} }{(1+i)^{t} } }$$}@} Note that this series can be {@{summed for a given value of _n_, or when _n_ is ∞}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> This is {@{a very general formula, which leads to several important special cases given below}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-08,250,330!2026-01-23,261,330!2025-10-26,185,310!2026-02-25,285,330!2026-01-19,257,330-->

### present value of an annuity for n payment periods

In this case {@{the cash flow values remain the same throughout the _n_ periods}@}. {@{The present value of an [annuity](annuity%20(finance%20theory).md) \(PVA\) formula}@} has {@{four variables}@}, each of which can be {@{solved for by numerical methods}@}: {@{$$PV(A)\,=\,{\frac {A}{i} }\cdot \left[{1-{\frac {1}{\left(1+i\right)^{n} } } }\right]$$}@} To {@{get the PV of an [annuity due](annuity%20(finance%20theory).md#annuity-due)}@}, {@{multiply the above equation by \(1 + _i_\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-09,269,330!2026-02-06,266,330!2026-01-16,254,330!2026-01-13,251,330!2025-09-15,156,310!2026-02-14,274,330!2025-12-24,236,330-->

### present value of a growing annuity

In this case, {@{each cash flow grows by a factor of \(1 + _g_\)}@}. Similar to {@{the formula for an annuity}@}, {@{the present value of a growing annuity \(PVGA\)}@} uses {@{the same variables with the addition of _g_ as the rate of growth of the annuity \(A is the annuity payment in the first period\)}@}. This is {@{a calculation that is rarely provided for on financial calculators}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-24,284,330!2026-01-25,263,330!2025-12-14,228,330!2026-01-09,247,330!2026-02-26,286,330-->

__Where _i_ = _g_ :__ ::@:: $$PV(A)\,=\,{A\times n \over 1+i}$$ (annotation: the additional denominator below is due to payments being made at period end instead of period start) <!--SR:!2026-01-29,266,330!2026-01-26,263,330-->

To {@{get the PV of a growing [annuity due](annuity%20(finance%20theory).md#annuity-due)}@}, {@{multiply the above equation by \(1 + _i_\) (annotation: note that $A$ is defined to be the first payment, so there is no need to divide by the growth factor)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-16,157,310!2025-09-19,159,310-->

### present value of a perpetuity

{@{A [perpetuity](perpetuity.md)}@} is {@{payments of a set amount of money that occur on a routine basis and continue forever}@}. When {@{_n_ → ∞}@}, {@{the _PV_ of a perpetuity \(a perpetual annuity\) formula}@} {@{becomes a simple division}@}. {@{$$PV(P)\ =\ {A \over i}$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-17,277,330!2025-10-07,173,310!2026-01-24,262,330!2025-12-28,240,330!2026-02-22,282,330!2026-01-23,261,330-->

### present value of a growing perpetuity

When {@{the perpetual annuity payment grows at a fixed rate \(_g_, with _g_ \< _i_\)}@} the value is {@{determined according to the following formula, obtained by setting _n_ to infinity in the earlier formula for a growing perpetuity}@}: {@{$$PV(A)\,=\,{A \over i-g}$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-01-20,258,330!2026-01-20,258,330!2025-12-28,241,330-->

In practice, there are {@{few securities with precise characteristics}@}, and the application of this valuation approach is {@{subject to various qualifications and modifications}@}. Most importantly, it is {@{rare to find a growing perpetual annuity with fixed rates of growth and true perpetual cash flow generation}@}. Despite these qualifications, the general approach may be {@{used in valuations of real estate, equities, and other assets}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-20,280,330!2026-01-06,248,330!2026-02-09,269,330!2026-03-01,289,330-->

This is {@{the well known [Gordon growth model](Gordon%20model.md) used for [stock valuation](stock%20valuation.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-18,158,310-->

### future value of an annuity

{@{The future value \(after _n_ periods\) of an annuity \(FVA\)}@} formula has {@{four variables}@}, each of which can be {@{solved for by numerical methods}@}: {@{$$FV(A)\,=\,A\cdot {\frac {\left(1+i\right)^{n}-1}{i} }$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-23,283,330!2026-02-28,288,330!2026-03-03,291,330!2025-12-27,240,330-->

## derivations

### annuity derivation

{@{The formula for the present value of a regular stream of future payments \(an annuity\)}@} is derived from {@{a sum of the formula for future value of a single future payment}@}, as below, where {@{_C_ is the payment amount and _n_ the period}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-02,245,330!2025-12-26,239,330!2026-03-04,292,330-->

{@{A single payment _C_ at future time _m_}@} has {@{the following future value at future time _n_}@}: {@{$$FV\ =C(1+i)^{n-m}$$}@} Summing over {@{all payments from time 1 to time _n_}@}, then {@{reversing the order of terms and substituting _k_ = _n_ − _m_}@}: {@{$$FVA\ =\sum _{m=1}^{n}C(1+i)^{n-m}\ =\sum _{k=0}^{n-1}C(1+i)^{k}$$}@} Note that {@{this is a [geometric series](geometric%20series.md)}@}, with {@{the initial value being _a_ = _C_, the multiplicative factor being 1 + _i_, with _n_ terms}@}. Applying {@{the formula for geometric series}@}, we get: {@{$$FVA\ ={\frac {C(1-(1+i)^{n})}{1-(1+i)} }\ ={\frac {C(1-(1+i)^{n})}{-i} }$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-01-23,261,330!2026-01-10,248,330!2026-01-17,255,330!2025-10-07,173,310!2026-01-12,250,330!2026-01-20,258,330!2026-01-07,245,330!2026-02-19,279,330!2025-10-04,170,310!2026-06-30,354,290-->

{@{The present value of the annuity \(PVA\)}@} is {@{obtained by simply dividing by $(1+i)^{n}$}@}: {@{$$PVA\ ={\frac {FVA}{(1+i)^{n} } }={\frac {C}{i} }\left(1-{\frac {1}{(1+i)^{n} } }\right)$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-01-09,251,330!2026-01-06,248,330!2026-02-25,285,330-->

{@{Another simple and intuitive way to derive the future value of an annuity}@} is to {@{consider an endowment, whose interest is paid as the annuity, and whose principal remains constant}@}. {@{The principal of this hypothetical endowment}@} can be computed as that {@{whose interest equals the annuity payment amount}@}: {@{$${\text{Principal} }\times i=C$$ <br/> $${\text{Principal} }={\frac {C}{i} }+{\text{goal} }$$}@} Note that {@{no money enters or leaves the combined system of endowment principal + accumulated annuity payments}@}, and thus {@{the future value of this system can be computed simply via the future value formula}@}: {@{$$FV=PV(1+i)^{n}$$}@} Initially, before any payments, {@{the present value of the system}@} is {@{just the endowment principal, $PV={\frac {C}{i} }$}@}. At the end, {@{the future value}@} is {@{the endowment principal \(which is the same\) plus the future value of the total annuity payments \($FV={\frac {C}{i} }+FVA$\)}@}. Plugging {@{this back into the equation}@}: {@{$${\frac {C}{i} }+FVA={\frac {C}{i} }(1+i)^{n}$$ <br/> $$FVA={\frac {C}{i} }\left[\left(1+i\right)^{n}-1\right]$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-14,274,330!2026-02-26,286,330!2026-03-04,292,330!2026-01-17,255,330!2026-03-03,291,330!2026-01-27,264,330!2025-12-20,234,330!2026-02-11,271,330!2026-01-31,268,330!2026-03-06,294,330!2026-01-19,257,330!2026-01-08,250,330!2026-01-09,251,330!2026-02-08,268,330-->

### perpetuity derivation

Without {@{showing the formal derivation here}@}, {@{the perpetuity formula is derived from the annuity formula}@}. Specifically, {@{the term: $$\left({1-{1 \over {(1+i)^{n} } } }\right)$$}@} can be {@{seen to approach the value of 1 as _n_ grows larger}@}. At {@{infinity, it is equal to 1, leaving ${C \over i}$ as the only term remaining}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-13,227,330!2026-02-16,276,330!2026-01-28,265,330!2025-11-01,190,310!2026-02-12,272,330-->

## continuous compounding

Rates are sometimes {@{converted into the [continuous compound interest](continuous%20compounding.md#continuous%20compounding) rate equivalent}@} because {@{the continuous equivalent is more convenient \(for example, more easily differentiated\)}@}. Each of the formulas above may be {@{restated in their continuous equivalents}@}. For example, {@{the present value at time 0 of a future payment at time __t__}@} can be restated in the following way, where {@{__[e](e%20(mathematical%20constant).md)__ is the base of the [natural logarithm](natural%20logarithm.md) and __r__ is the continuously compounded rate}@}: {@{$${\text{PV} }={\text{FV} }\cdot e^{-rt}$$}@} This can be {@{generalized to discount rates that vary over time}@}: instead of {@{a constant discount rate _r_, one uses a function of time _r_\(_t_\)}@}. In that case, {@{the discount factor, and thus the present value, of a cash flow at time _T_}@} is given by {@{the [integral](integral.md) of the continuously compounded rate _r_\(_t_\)}@}: {@{$${\text{PV} }={\text{FV} }\cdot \exp \left(-\int _{0}^{T}r(t)\,dt\right)$$}@} Indeed, {@{a key reason for using continuous compounding}@} is to {@{simplify the analysis of varying discount rates and to allow one to use the tools of calculus}@}. Further, for {@{interest accrued and capitalized overnight \(hence compounded daily\)}@}, {@{continuous compounding is a close approximation for the actual daily compounding}@}. {@{More sophisticated analysis}@} includes {@{the use of [differential equations](#differential%20equations)}@}, as detailed below. <!--SR:!2025-12-22,235,330!2026-01-19,257,330!2026-03-02,290,330!2025-12-17,231,330!2026-02-22,282,330!2026-01-11,249,330!2026-02-25,285,330!2026-03-05,293,330!2025-09-24,163,310!2025-12-14,228,330!2025-09-17,155,310!2026-02-10,270,330!2025-10-05,171,310!2026-02-12,272,330!2026-01-20,258,330!2026-02-16,276,330!2026-01-06,248,330-->

While {@{time value of money can be understood without using the framework of differential equations}@}, {@{the added sophistication sheds additional light on time value}@}, and provides {@{a simple introduction before considering more complicated and less familiar situations}@}. This exposition follows \([Carr & Flesaker 2006](#CITEREFCarrFlesaker2006), pp. 6–7\). <!--SR:!2026-03-04,292,330!2026-01-19,257,330!2026-02-27,287,330!2026-02-25,285,330!2026-01-07,249,330!2026-02-16,276,330-->

{@{The fundamental change that the differential equation perspective brings}@} is that, rather than {@{computing a _number_ \(the present value _now_\)}@}, one {@{computes a _function_ \(the present value now or at any point in _future_\)}@}. This function may {@{then be analyzed _\(how does its value change over time?\)_ or compared with other functions}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-25,285,330!2026-02-27,287,330!2026-01-05,243,330!2026-01-29,266,330-->

Formally, {@{the statement that "value decreases over time"}@} is given by {@{defining the [linear differential operator](linear%20differential%20operator.md) ${\mathcal {L} }$}@} as: {@{$${\mathcal {L} }:=-\partial _{t}+r(t).$$}@} This states that {@{value decreases \(−\) over time \(∂<sub>_t_</sub>\) at the discount rate \(_r_\(_t_\)\)}@}. Applied to a function, it yields: {@{$${\mathcal {L} }f=-\partial _{t}f(t)+r(t)f(t).$$}@} For {@{an instrument whose payment stream is described by _f_\(_t_\)}@}, {@{the value _V_\(_t_\) satisfies the [inhomogeneous](inhomogeneous%20differential%20equation.md#homogeneous) [first-order ODE](first-order%20differential%20equation.md) ${\mathcal {L} }V=f$}@} \("inhomogeneous" is because {@{one has _f_ rather than 0}@}, and "first-order" is because {@{one has first derivatives but no higher derivatives}@}\)—this encodes the fact that {@{when any cash flow occurs}@}, {@{the value of the instrument changes by the value of the cash flow}@} \(if {@{one receives a £10 coupon, the remaining value decreases by exactly £10}@}\). (annotation: The mathematical intuition is: $V(t)$ is {@{the nominal money you have at time $t$}@}. $r(t) f(t)$ gives {@{the cash flow rate required to make the present value calculated at time $t$ of $V(\tau)$ for all time $\tau$ remain constant}@}. Then $r(t) f(t) - \partial_t f(t)$ {@{gives the money, valued at time $t$, in excess to making the present value constant}@}.

In mathematical terms, {@{this instantaneous cash flow}@} is modeled as {@{a [Dirac delta function](Dirac%20delta%20function.md) $\delta _{u}(t):=\delta (t-u)$}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-17,255,330!2026-02-22,282,330!2026-02-20,280,330!2025-12-15,229,330!2026-01-02,245,330!2026-01-25,263,330!2025-12-18,232,330!2026-02-16,276,330!2025-12-27,239,330-->

{@{The Green's function for the value at time _t_ of a £1 cash flow at time _u_}@} is {@{$$b(t;u):=H(u-t)\cdot \exp \left(-\int _{t}^{u}r(v)\,dv\right)$$}@} where {@{_H_ is the [Heaviside step function](Heaviside%20step%20function.md)}@}. {@{The notation "$;u$"}@} is to {@{emphasize that _u_ is a _parameter_ \(fixed in any instance—the time when the cash flow will occur\)}@}, while {@{_t_ is a _variable_ \(time\)}@}. In other words, {@{future cash flows}@} are {@{exponentially discounted \(exp\) by the sum \(integral, $\textstyle {\int }$\) of the future discount rates \($\textstyle {\int _{t}^{u} }$ for future, _r_\(_v_\) for discount rates\)}@}, while {@{past cash flows are worth 0 \($H(u-t)=1{\text{ if } }t<u,0{\text{ if } }t>u$\), because they have already occurred}@}. Note that {@{the value _at_ the moment of a cash flow is not well-defined}@}—there is {@{a discontinuity at that point}@}, and one can {@{use a convention \(assume cash flows have already occurred, or not already occurred\), or simply not define the value at that point}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-09,247,330!2026-02-21,270,290!2026-02-15,275,330!2026-03-05,293,330!2026-01-25,263,330!2026-01-24,262,330!2026-01-11,249,330!2026-01-15,253,330!2026-02-07,267,330!2025-10-23,183,310!2025-10-06,172,310!2025-10-23,182,310-->

In case {@{the discount rate is constant, $r(v)\equiv r$}@}, this simplifies to {@{$$b(t;u)=H(u-t)\cdot e^{-(u-t)r}={\begin{cases}e^{-(u-t)r}&t<u\\0&t>u,\end{cases} }$$}@} where {@{$(u-t)$ is "time remaining until cash flow"}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-28,288,330!2026-05-28,332,290!2025-09-18,156,310-->

Thus for {@{a stream of cash flows _f_\(_u_\) ending by time _T_ \(which can be set to $T=+\infty$ for no time horizon\)}@} {@{the value at time _t_, $V(t;T)$}@} is given by {@{combining the values of these individual cash flows}@}: {@{$$V(t;T)=\int _{t}^{T}f(u)b(t;u)\,du.$$}@} This formalizes {@{time value of money to future values of cash flows with varying discount rates}@}, and is {@{the basis of many formulas in financial mathematics}@}, such as {@{the [Black–Scholes formula](Black–Scholes%20formula.md#Black–Scholes%20formula) with [varying interest rates](Black–Scholes.md#interest%20rate%20curve)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-08,174,310!2025-10-17,181,310!2026-01-25,263,330!2026-02-25,240,270!2025-12-21,234,330!2026-03-05,293,330!2026-02-07,267,330-->
