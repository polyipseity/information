{@{__Total absorption costing__ \(TAC\)}@} is {@{a method of [Accounting cost](accounting%20cost.md)}@} which {@{entails the full cost of manufacturing or providing a service}@}. TAC includes {@{not just the costs of materials and labour}@}, but also {@{of all manufacturing overheads \(whether 'fixed' or 'variable'\)}@}. {@{The cost of each cost center}@} can be {@{direct or indirect}@}. {@{The direct cost}@} can be {@{easily identified with individual cost centers}@}. Whereas {@{indirect cost}@} {@{cannot be easily identified with the cost center}@}. {@{The distribution of overhead among the departments}@} is called {@{apportionment}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-09,238,330!2026-06-15,243,330!2026-06-07,237,330!2025-11-02,72,330!2026-06-29,255,330!2026-06-10,239,330!2026-06-28,254,330!2026-06-11,240,330!2026-06-20,247,330!2026-06-07,237,330!2026-06-19,246,330!2026-06-13,241,330!2026-06-01,231,330-->

## primary apportionment or distribution of overheads

{@{The selection of the base}@} on which {@{overheads are or should be apportioned}@} depends on the following principles: \(annotation: 3 items: {@{service or use basis, survey basis, ability to pay basis}@}\) <!--SR:!2026-06-18,246,330!2026-06-05,235,330!2026-06-25,251,330-->

- Service or use basis: ::@:: If the benefit obtained by various departments from the overheads can be measured, overheads can be apportioned on that basis. <!--SR:!2026-06-15,243,330!2026-06-07,237,330-->
- Survey basis: ::@:: If amount of overhead can't be measured survey basis can be applied. For example, if it can be noted that a supervisor is giving 60% of their time to one department and 40% to another, their wage can be apportioned on that basis. <!--SR:!2025-10-24,64,330!2026-06-19,246,330-->
- Ability to pay basis: ::@:: In this case the apportionment may depend on the factors like total sale/profitability. This may not be a fair case always as some departments may have to take most of the burden. <!--SR:!2026-06-06,236,330!2025-11-14,29,290-->

## secondary apportionment

With the process of {@{primary apportionment or distribution}@}, {@{the loading of overheads for all the departments}@} i.e. {@{production as well as service departments}@} {@{can be obtained}@}. {@{The next step}@} is to {@{transfer the overheads of non-production departments}@} to {@{the production departments}@}, as {@{the various cost centers}@} {@{move through the production departments only}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-09,238,330!2026-06-25,251,330!2026-06-29,255,330!2026-06-28,254,330!2026-06-21,248,330!2026-06-26,252,330!2026-06-10,239,330!2025-11-07,76,330!2026-06-02,232,330-->

### absorption

{@{Each job}@} while {@{moving through the production department}@} should {@{get its share of overhead}@}. {@{This process of distribution of overheads}@} is called {@{absorption}@}. There can be {@{a number of methods of absorption of overheads}@}, consideration should be given to {@{the type of industry, manufacturing process, nature of industry etc.}@} {@{The various methods of absorption}@} are \(annotation: 5 items: {@{direct material cost percentage rate, direct labor cost percentage rate, prime cost percentage rate, labor hour rate, machine hour rate}@}\) <!--SR:!2026-06-21,248,330!2026-06-23,250,330!2026-06-24,251,330!2026-06-12,241,330!2026-06-16,244,330!2026-06-08,237,330!2026-03-24,175,310!2026-06-24,251,330!2025-11-14,28,290-->

- Direct labour cost percentage rate
- Prime cost percentage rate
- Labour hour rate
- Machine hour rate

### direct material cost percentage rate

In this method {@{overhead is calculated}@} as {@{a percentage of the material cost}@}. This is used where {@{the material cost is high and of prime importance}@}. Here {@{other costs}@} are {@{negligible or are dependent on the material cost}@}. This is calculated as {@{\(Amount of overhead/Material cost\)x 100}@}. If {@{the production overhead is 3,000}@} and {@{the material cost is 10,000}@} then {@{the absorption rate}@} will be <p> {@{\(3000/10000\)x 100 = 30%}@} <!--SR:!2025-10-23,63,330!2026-06-18,246,330!2026-06-27,253,330!2026-06-06,236,330!2025-11-07,76,330!2026-06-14,242,330!2026-06-17,245,330!2026-06-26,252,330!2026-06-11,240,330!2025-11-07,76,330-->

Now for {@{a product}@} if {@{the material cost is 1000}@} then {@{the overhead cost is 300}@}. so {@{the total cost would be 1300}@}. {@{The classic example of industry}@} using this type of absorption are {@{gold jewelers}@} and {@{the typical absorption rate}@} varies from {@{2-5% of the cost of the gold}@}. If {@{the cost of the material fluctuates}@} {@{this method cannot be used}@}. For this type of absorption {@{the material cost should be stable}@}. If in {@{the same industry}@} {@{material of different cost is used}@} {@{the calculation becomes unjustified}@}, especially when {@{the cost of the material differ too much}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-02,72,330!2025-11-02,72,330!2026-06-12,241,330!2026-06-13,241,330!2026-06-07,237,330!2026-06-06,236,330!2026-06-07,237,330!2026-06-27,253,330!2026-06-23,250,330!2026-06-04,234,330!2026-06-07,237,330!2026-06-26,252,330!2026-06-27,253,330!2026-06-11,240,330!2025-11-02,72,330-->

### direct labour cost percentage rate

In this method {@{cost is absorbed}@} as {@{a percent of the labour cost or the wages}@}. {@{\(Overhead cost/Labour cost\)x 100}@}. If {@{the Labour cost is 5000}@} and {@{the overhead cost is 1000}@} then {@{the absorption cost is 20%}@}. If {@{the labour cost of one job is 500}@} it will have to {@{absorb 20% i.e. 100 as the overhead cost}@} making {@{the total cost to be 600}@}. This method can be used in {@{service industry}@} where {@{the major input is the skilled or unskilled labour}@}. For {@{the proper calculation}@} {@{labour rates need to be constant}@} and {@{the skill and efficiency of the labourer}@} need to {@{be identical}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-29,255,330!2026-05-31,230,330!2026-05-29,228,330!2025-11-02,72,330!2026-06-15,243,330!2026-06-22,249,330!2026-06-15,243,330!2026-06-29,255,330!2026-06-16,244,330!2026-06-12,241,330!2026-06-12,241,330!2026-06-08,237,330!2026-06-26,252,330!2026-06-04,234,330!2026-06-19,246,330-->

### prime cost percentage rate

In this method {@{both material cost as well as labour cost}@} is {@{the base for calculating the overhead absorption}@}. It is calculated as {@{\(Overhead Cost/Prime cost\)x 100}@}. {@{Prime cost}@} is nothing but {@{the sum of direct material cost and direct labour cost}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-17,245,330!2026-06-28,254,330!2026-06-18,246,330!2026-06-14,242,330!2026-05-30,229,330-->

### labour hour rate

{@{This method is mostly used}@} if {@{the industry is labour-intensive}@} and the labour is {@{mostly unskilled or semiskilled}@}. It is calculated as {@{\(overhead cost/ Labour hours required for production\)}@}. If {@{the labour hour required is 1000}@} and {@{the overhead to be absorbed is 250}@} then {@{the rate is .25 per labour hour}@}. If {@{20 labour hours are required to complete a job}@} then {@{the overhead will be 5}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-14,242,330!2026-06-08,237,330!2025-10-22,62,330!2026-06-20,247,330!2026-06-13,241,330!2026-06-06,236,330!2026-06-08,237,330!2026-06-25,251,330!2026-06-16,244,330-->

### machine hour rate

If {@{the industry considered}@} has {@{a high degree of [automation](automation.md) and mechanization}@} then {@{this method can be used}@}. Here {@{the major chunk of the cost}@} comes from {@{the utilization of the machines}@}. It is calculated as {@{\(overhead cost/ number of machine hours\)}@}. This is very useful if {@{the running cost of the machines including rent}@} are {@{the dominant part of the cost of the product}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-24,64,330!2026-06-10,239,330!2026-06-03,233,330!2026-06-05,235,330!2026-06-22,249,330!2025-11-07,76,330!2026-06-24,251,330!2026-06-23,250,330-->

{@{One of the main reasons}@} for {@{absorbing overheads into the cost}@} of is for {@{[inventory](inventory.md) valuation purposes}@}. {@{Absorption costing}@} is {@{permissible under [GAAP](generally%20accepted%20accounting%20principles.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-07,76,330!2026-06-19,246,330!2026-06-21,248,330!2026-06-20,247,330!2026-06-25,251,330-->

{@{Traditional TAC}@} was developed in {@{the age of manufacturing}@} and mostly used to {@{arrive at the full [manufacturing cost](manufacturing%20cost.md) of producing goods}@}; {@{an alternative method of arriving at full cost}@} known as {@{[activity-based costing](activity-based%20costing.md) \(ABC\)}@} is often {@{thought to be more appropriate for services}@}. {@{Absorption costing}@} is {@{a means of incorporating a fair share of indirect cost or overheads}@} into {@{the cost of a unit of product or service provided}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-09,238,330!2026-06-27,253,330!2026-06-13,241,330!2025-10-21,61,330!2026-06-18,246,330!2025-11-02,72,330!2026-06-09,238,330!2026-06-10,239,330!2026-06-17,245,330-->

## absorption costing

{@{A costing method}@} that {@{includes all manufacturing costs}@}—{@{direct materials, direct labour, and both overhead}@}—in {@{unit product costs}@}. According to {@{the ICMA London}@} "{@{Absorption costing}@} is {@{a principle whereby fixed as well as variable costs}@} are {@{allocated to cost unit}@}; {@{the term may be applied}@} where {@{production costs only or costs of all function are so allocated}@}."<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-06-09,238,330!2026-06-20,247,330!2026-06-28,254,330!2026-06-14,242,330!2026-06-07,237,330!2026-06-21,248,330!2026-06-08,237,330!2026-06-22,249,330!2026-06-06,236,330!2026-06-11,240,330-->
