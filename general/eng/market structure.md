__Market structure__, in [economics](economics.md), depicts {@{how firms are differentiated and categorised based on the types of goods they sell \(homogeneous/heterogeneous\)}@} and {@{how their operations are affected by external factors and elements}@}. Market structure makes it easier to {@{understand the characteristics of diverse markets}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-02-16,68,320!2025-02-21,73,320-->

The main body of the market is {@{composed of suppliers and demanders}@}. Both parties are {@{equal and indispensable}@}. The market structure {@{determines the price formation method of the market}@}. {@{Suppliers and Demanders \(sellers and buyers\)}@} will {@{aim to find a price that both parties can accept creating a equilibrium quantity}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-03-01,80,338!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-03-03,82,338-->

{@{Market definition}@} is {@{an important issue for regulators facing changes in market structure, which needs to be determined}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {@{The relationship between buyers and sellers as the main body of the market}@} includes {@{three situations}@}: {@{the relationship between sellers \(enterprises and enterprises\), the relationship between buyers \(enterprises or consumers\) and the relationship between buyers and sellers}@}; the relationship between {@{the buyer and seller of the market and the buyer and seller entering the market}@}. These relationships are {@{the market competition and monopoly relationships}@} reflected in economics. <!--SR:!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-01-30,54,310!2025-02-11,65,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-13,54,260!2025-08-16,200,320!2025-02-22,74,320-->

## history

- see: [_Laissez-faire_](Laissez-faire.md)

Market structure has been {@{a topic of discussion for many economists like [Adam Smith](Adam%20Smith.md) and [Karl Marx](Karl%20Marx.md)}@} who have {@{strong conflicting viewpoints on how the market operates in presence of political influence}@}. {@{Adam Smith in his writing on economics}@} stressed {@{the importance of [Laissez-faire](Laissez-faire.md) principles outlining the operation of the market in the absence of dominant political mechanisms of control}@}, while {@{Karl Marx}@} discussed {@{the working of the market in the presence of a controlled economy}@}<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> sometimes referred to as {@{a command economy in the literature}@}. Both types of market structure have been in {@{historical evidence throughout the twentieth century and twenty-first century}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-27,78,338!2025-02-27,78,338!2025-02-11,65,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-20,72,320!2025-02-16,68,320!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-02-16,68,320-->

Market structure has been {@{apparent throughout history due to its natural influence it has on markets}@}, this can be based on {@{the different contributing factors that market up each type of market structure}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-11,65,320-->

## types

Based on {@{the factors that decide the structure of the market}@}, the main forms of market structure are as follows: <!--SR:!2025-02-18,70,320-->

- {@{[Perfect competition](perfect%20competition.md)}@} refers to {@{a type of market where there are many buyers and sellers that feature free [barriers to entry](barriers%20to%20entry.md)}@}, dealing with {@{homogeneous products with no differentiation}@}, where {@{the price is fixed by the market}@}. Individual firms are {@{price takers<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> as the price is set by the industry as a whole}@}. Example: {@{Agricultural products which have many buyers and sellers}@}, selling {@{homogeneous goods where the price is determined by the demand and supply of the market and not individual firms}@}. In {@{the short run, a firm in a perfectly competitive market may gain profits or loss}@}, but in {@{the long run, due to the entry and exit of new firms, price will equal ATC in the long run, which is the lowest point of average total cost}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup>
  - {@{[Imperfect Competition](imperfect%20competition.md)}@} refers to {@{markets where standards for perfect competition are not fulfilled}@} \(such as {@{no barriers for entry and exit, homogeneous products and many buyers and sellers}@}\). {@{All other types of competition}@} come under imperfect competition.
- {@{[Monopolistic competition](monopolistic%20competition.md)}@}, a type of {@{imperfect competition}@} where {@{there are many sellers}@}, selling {@{products that are closely related but differentiated from one another \(e.g. quality of products may differentiate\) and hence they are not perfect substitutes}@}. This market structure exists when {@{there are multiple sellers who attempt to seem different from one another}@}. Examples: {@{toothpaste, soft drinks, clothing}@} as they are {@{all heterogeneous products with many buyers and sellers, no to low entry barriers}@} but {@{are different from each other due to quality, taste, or branding}@}. Firms have {@{partial control over the price as they are not price takers \(due to differentiated products\) or price makers \(as there are many buyers and sellers\)}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup>
- {@{[Oligopoly](oligopoly.md)}@} refers to {@{a market structure where only a small number of firms operate together control the majority of the market share}@}. Firms are {@{neither price takers or makers}@}. Firms tend to {@{avoid [price wars](price%20war.md) by following price rigidity}@}. They {@{closely monitor the prices of their competitors and change prices accordingly}@}. Oligopoly firms focus on {@{quality and efficiency of their products to compete with other firms}@}. Example: {@{Network providers}@}<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> \({@{entry barriers, small number of sellers, many buyers, products can be homogeneous or differentiated}@}\). Three types of oligopoly. Due to the hallmark of oligopoly being {@{the presence of strategic interactions among rival firms}@}, the optimal business strategy of an enterprise can be {@{studied through the thought of game theory}@}. Under the logic of game theory, {@{enterprises in oligopoly market have interdependent behavior}@}. These actions are {@{non-cooperative, each company is making decisions that maximize its own profits}@}, and equilibrium is reached when {@{all businesses are doing their best, taking into account the actions of their competitors}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup>
  - {@{[Duopoly](duopoly.md)}@}, a case of an oligopoly where {@{two firms operate and have power over the market}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> Example: {@{Aircraft manufactures: [Boeing](Boeing.md) and [Airbus](Airbus.md)}@}. A duopoly in theory could have {@{the same effect as a monopoly on pricing within a market if they were to collude on prices and or output of goods}@}.
  - {@{[Oligopsony](oligopsony.md)}@}, a market where {@{many sellers can be present but meet only a few buyers}@}. Example: {@{Cocoa producers}@}
  - {@{[Cournot quantity competition](Cournot%20competition.md)}@}, {@{one of the first models of oligopoly markets}@} was developed by {@{[Augustin Cournot](Antoine%20Augustin%20Cournot.md) in 1835}@}. In Cournot's model, there are {@{two firms and each firm selects a quantity to produce, and the resulting total output determines the market price}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup>
  - {@{[Bertrand Price Competition](Bertrand%20competition.md)}@}, {@{[Joseph Bertrand](Joseph%20Bertrand.md) was the first to analyze this model in 1883}@}. In Bertrand’s model, there are {@{two firms and each firm selects a price to maximize its own profits, given the price that it believes the other firm will select}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup>
- {@{[Monopoly](monopoly.md)}@}, where {@{there is only one seller of a product or service which has no substitute}@}. The firm is {@{the price maker as they have control over the industry}@}. There are {@{high barriers to entry}@}, which {@{an incumbent would conduct entry-deterring strategies of keeping out entrants reaping additional profits for the company}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> {@{Frank Fisher}@}, {@{a noticed antitrust economist}@} has described {@{monopoly power as "the ability to act in an unconstrained way,"}@} such as {@{increasing price or reducing quality}@}.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> Example: {@{[Standard Oil](Standard%20Oil.md) \(1870–1911\)}@} Under monopoly, monopoly firms can {@{obtain excess profits through differential prices}@}. According to {@{the degree of price difference}@}, {@{price discrimination can be divided into three levels}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup>
  - {@{[Natural monopoly](natural%20monopoly.md)}@}, a monopoly in which {@{[economies of scale](economies%20of%20scale.md) cause efficiency to increase continuously with the size of the firm}@}. A firm is a natural monopoly if {@{it is able to serve the entire market demand at a lower cost than any combination of two or more smaller, more specialized firms}@}; or {@{natural obstacles}@}, such as {@{the sole ownership of natural resources}@}: {@{[De beers](De%20Beers.md) was a monopoly in the diamond industry for years}@}.
  - {@{[Monopsony](monopsony.md)}@}, when {@{there is only a single buyer in a market}@}. Discussion of {@{monopsony power in the labor literature}@} largely focused on {@{the pure monopsony model in which a single firm comprised the entirety of demand for labor in a market \(e.g., company town\)}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-19,71,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-20,72,320!2025-05-14,127,300!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-07-28,187,320!2025-06-23,147,300!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-08-24,207,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-20,72,320!2025-02-20,72,320!2025-08-25,208,320!2025-02-17,69,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-08-08,200,320!2025-03-02,81,338!2025-02-14,66,310!2025-06-24,147,300!2025-02-19,71,320!2025-05-06,121,290!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-06-23,146,300!2025-06-13,138,290!2025-02-15,67,310!2025-05-15,128,300!2025-08-09,199,320!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-05-03,103,300!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-02-11,65,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-20,72,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-03-31,86,280!2025-02-19,71,320!2025-06-14,139,280!2025-03-01,80,338!2025-08-09,200,320!2025-02-19,71,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-26,77,338!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-03-03,82,338!2025-08-07,199,320!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-06-25,147,300!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-08-26,209,320!2025-02-16,68,320!2025-04-08,91,280!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-11,65,320!2025-03-02,81,338!2025-06-29,164,318!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-06-22,150,300!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-11,65,320!2025-02-27,78,338!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-24,67,339-->

## features of market structures

{@{The imperfectly competitive structure}@} is {@{quite identical to the realistic market conditions}@} where {@{some [monopolistic competitors](monopolistic%20competition.md), [monopolists](monopoly.md), [oligopolists](oligopoly.md), and [duopolists](duopoly.md) exist and dominate the market conditions}@}. {@{The elements of market structure}@} include {@{the number and size of sellers, entry and exit barriers}@}, {@{nature of product, price, selling costs}@}. Market structure can {@{alter based on the new external factors}@}, such as {@{technology, consumer preferences and new entrants}@}. Therefore, elements of market structure always {@{stay the same}@} but {@{the importance of a single element may change making it more influential on the current structure}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-02-17,69,320!2025-01-30,54,310!2025-02-19,71,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-02-17,69,320!2025-03-03,82,338!2025-02-18,70,320-->

{@{Competition is useful}@} because {@{it reveals actual customer demand}@} and {@{induces the seller \(operator\) to provide service quality levels and price levels that buyers \(customers\) want, typically subject to the seller's financial need to cover its costs}@}. In other words, competition can {@{align the seller's interests with the buyer's interests}@} and {@{can cause the seller to reveal his true costs and other private information}@}. In {@{the absence of perfect competition}@}, {@{three basic approaches}@} can be adopted to deal with problems related to {@{the control of [market power](market%20power.md) and an asymmetry between the government and the operator with respect to objectives and information}@}: \(a\) {@{subjecting the operator to competitive pressures}@}, \(b\) {@{gathering information on the operator and the market}@}, and \(c\) {@{applying incentive regulation}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-08-04,196,320!2025-02-20,72,320!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-20,72,320!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-05-13,126,300!2025-02-19,71,320!2025-02-18,70,320-->

The correct sequence of the market structure from {@{most to least competitive}@} is {@{perfect competition, imperfect competition, oligopoly, and pure monopoly}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-19,71,320!2025-02-16,68,320-->

{@{The main criteria by which one can distinguish between different market structures}@} are: {@{the number and size of firms and [consumers](consumer.md) in the market, the type of [goods](product%20(business).md) and [services](service%20(economics).md) being traded, and the degree to which [information](information.md) can flow freely}@}. In today's time, {@{Karl Marx's theory about political influence on market}@} makes sense as {@{firms and industry are affected strongly by the regulation, taxes, tariffs, patents imposed by the government}@}. These affect {@{the barriers to entry and exit for the firms in the market}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-03-28,82,270!2025-02-12,64,310!2025-02-17,69,320!2025-02-21,73,320-->

Different market structures will also lead to {@{different levels of social welfare}@}. Generally speaking, as {@{the degree of competition increases}@}, {@{the total social welfare measured by producer surplus plus consumer surplus will rise}@}. {@{The total surplus of perfect competition market}@} is the highest. And {@{the total surplus of imperfect competition market}@} is lower. In {@{the monopoly market}@}, if {@{the monopoly firm can adopt first-level price discrimination}@}, {@{the consumer surplus is zero and the monopoly firm obtains all the benefits in the market}@}.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-02-11,65,320!2025-02-17,69,320!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-02-11,65,320!2025-08-14,203,320-->

### perfect competition

__Perfect competition:__

1. There are many ::@:: buyers and sellers in the market, and there is no fixed buying and selling relationship between them. <!--SR:!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-20,72,320-->
2. The products or services ::@:: traded in the market are all the same without any difference. <!--SR:!2025-06-02,134,290!2025-02-26,77,338-->
3. There are no barriers ::@:: to entry and exit from the market. <!--SR:!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-18,70,320-->
4. There are no trade ::@:: secrets. <!--SR:!2025-02-19,71,320!2025-02-19,71,320-->
5. Capital resources and labour are ::@:: easily transferable. <!--SR:!2025-02-17,69,320!2025-02-11,65,320-->

### monopolistic competition

__Monopolistic Competition:__

There are {@{a large number of enterprises, there are no restrictions on entering and exiting the market}@}, and they sell {@{different products of the same kind, and enterprises have a certain ability to control prices}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> Monopolies have {@{complete market control}@} as {@{the barriers to entry are high and the threat of new entrants is low}@}; therefore {@{they can price set to their preference}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-06-13,143,300!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-22,74,320-->

### oligopoly

__Oligopoly:__

The number of enterprises is {@{small, entry and exit from the market are restricted}@}, product attributes are {@{different, and the demand curve is downward sloping and relatively inelastic}@}. Oligopolies are usually found in {@{industries in which initial capital requirements are high and existing companies have strong foothold in market share}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-03,82,338!2025-08-10,200,320!2025-02-18,70,320-->

### monopoly

__Monopoly:__

The number of enterprises is {@{only one, access is restricted or completely blocked}@}, and the products produced and sold are {@{unique and cannot be replaced by other products}@}. The company has {@{strong control and influence over the price of the entire market}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-03-01,80,338!2025-02-13,65,310-->

## importance of market structure

Market structure is important for a firm's use as it {@{affects motivations, decision making, and opportunities}@}. This will {@{incur changes to current market standings}@} affecting: {@{market outcomes, price, availability and variety}@}.<sup>[\[16\]](#^ref-16)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-20,72,320!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-03-02,81,338-->

Market structure provides {@{indication on potential opportunities and threats}@} which can influence {@{business to adapt there processes and operations in order to meet market structure requirements in order to stay competitive}@}. For example being able to understand market structure will help to identify {@{product substitutability, a foundation element of market structure analysis}@}, to then determine the best course of action. <!--SR:!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-02-11,65,320!2025-02-28,79,338-->

## measure of market structure

- {@{N-firm concentration ratio, N-firm concentration ratio}@} is {@{a common measure of market structure}@}. This gives {@{the combined market share of the N largest firms in the market}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> For example, if {@{the 5-firm concentration ratio in the United States smart phone industry is about .8}@}, which indicates that {@{the combined market share of the five largest smart phone sellers in the United states is about 80 percent}@}.
- {@{[Herfindahl index](Herfindahl–Hirschman%20index.md), The Herfindahl index}@} defined as {@{the sum of the squared market shares of all the firms in the market}@}. Increases in the Herfindahl index generally indicate {@{a decrease in competition and an increase of market power, vice versal}@}. Generally, the Herfindahl index conveys {@{more information than the N-firm concentration ratio}@}. In general, this index can also measure {@{the market concentration of the top n companies, and the impact of corporate mergers and acquisitions on the market structure}@}. And although {@{any relationship between Herfindahl index and concentration ratio can only provide a rough approximation}@}, the estimation \(prediction\) of Herfindahl index becomes {@{rapidly more accurate when given some of the largest market shares}@}.<sup>[\[17\]](#^ref-17)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-11,65,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-11,65,320!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-02-28,79,338!2025-01-30,54,310!2025-02-18,70,320!2025-02-18,70,320-->

Besides market structure, {@{many factors contribute to conduct and market performance}@}. Market pressures are similarly evolving therefore when {@{decision making based on market performance}@} it is essential to {@{assess all the circumstances affecting competition rather than rely solely on measures of market structure}@}. {@{Using a single measurement of market share}@} can be {@{misleading or inconclusive as only indicators are taken into account}@}.<sup>[\[18\]](#^ref-18)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-16,68,320!2025-02-19,71,320!2025-06-16,146,300!2025-02-11,65,320!2025-02-21,73,320-->

Different aspects that have been taken into account to {@{measure the innovative advantage within particular market structures}@} are: {@{the size distribution of firms, the existence of certain barriers to entry, and the stage of industry in the product lifecycle}@}.<sup>[\[19\]](#^ref-19)</sup> Creating {@{another measure to determine the current market structure}@} that can be used as {@{evidence or to evaluate current market performance}@} thus it can be used to {@{forecast and determine future trends}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-22,74,320!2025-06-12,142,300!2025-02-21,73,320!2025-02-13,65,310!2025-02-18,70,320-->
