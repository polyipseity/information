# expansion of the universe

The __expansion of the universe__ is {@{the increase in [distance](proper%20length.md) between [gravitationally unbound](gravitational%20binding%20energy.md) parts of the [observable universe](observable%20universe.md) with time}@}. It is {@{an [intrinsic](intrinsic%20and%20extrinsic%20properties%20(philosophy).md) expansion}@}, so {@{it does not mean that the universe expands "into" anything or that space exists "outside" it}@}. To {@{any observer in the universe}@}, it appears that {@{all but [the nearest galaxies](Local%20Group.md) (which are bound to each other by gravity) recede at [speeds that are proportional to their distance from the observer](Hubble's%20law.md), on average}@}. While {@{objects cannot move [faster than light](faster-than-light.md)}@}, this limitation {@{applies only with respect to [local](principle%20of%20locality.md) [reference frames](frame%20of%20reference.md)}@} and {@{does not limit the recession rates of cosmologically distant objects}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-16,535,310!2028-03-17,1015,350!2025-08-26,287,330!2028-10-05,1173,350!2026-11-07,558,310!2028-08-04,1124,350!2027-09-15,852,330!2028-09-28,1169,350-->
