# interacting galaxy

## galactic cannibalism

{@{__Galactic cannibalism__}@} is {@{a common phenomenon}@}. It refers to {@{the process in which a large [galaxy](galaxy.md), through [tidal](galactic%20tide.md) gravitational interactions with a companion, merges with that companion}@}. The most common result of the gravitational merger between two or more galaxies is {@{a larger [irregular galaxy](irregular%20galaxy.md), but [elliptical galaxies](elliptical%20galaxy.md) may also result}@}. <!--SR:!2028-12-29,1238,350!2028-04-18,1040,350!2027-11-04,896,330!2028-04-21,1043,350-->

It has been suggested that galactic cannibalism is {@{currently occurring between the [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md) and the [Large and Small Magellanic Clouds](Magellanic%20Clouds.md)}@}. {@{Streams of gravitationally-attracted [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) arcing from these dwarf galaxies to the Milky Way}@} is taken as evidence for the theory. <!--SR:!2028-10-11,1178,350!2029-04-29,1334,350-->
