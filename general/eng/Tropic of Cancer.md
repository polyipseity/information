# Tropic of Cancer

The __Tropic of Cancer__, also known as {@{the __Northern Tropic__}@}, is {@{the [Earth](Earth.md)'s [northernmost](north.md) circle of [latitude](latitude.md) where the [Sun](Sun.md) can be seen [directly overhead](subsolar%20point.md)}@}. This happens on {@{the [June solstice](June%20solstice.md)}@}. The Sun also {@{touches 90 degrees below the horizon ([nadir](nadir.md)) on the [December solstice](December%20solstice.md) in locations along the Tropic of Cancer}@}. Its [southern](south.md) equivalent is {@{the [Tropic of Capricorn](Tropic%20of%20Capricorn.md)}@}.

Using a continuously updated formula, the circle is {@{currently 23°26′10.0″ (or 23.43611°) [north](north.md) of the [equator](equator.md)}@}, which approximates {@{[Earth](Earth.md)'s [axial tilt](axial%20tilt.md)}@}.

## name

This line of [latitude](latitude.md) was named {@{after the [constellation](constellation.md) [Cancer](Cancer%20(constellation).md) during last centuries [BCE](Common%20Era..md), as the [Sun](Sun.md) was there on the [June solstice](June%20solstice.md)}@}. Due to {@{westward [precession of the equinoxes](axial%20precession.md)}@}, this is no longer the case. The current constellation is {@{[Gemini](Gemini%20(constellation).md)}@}.
