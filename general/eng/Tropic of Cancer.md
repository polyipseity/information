# Tropic of Cancer

The __Tropic of Cancer__, also known as {@{the __Northern Tropic__}@}, is {@{the [Earth](Earth.md)'s [northernmost](north.md) circle of [latitude](latitude.md) where the [Sun](Sun.md) can be seen [directly overhead](subsolar%20point.md)}@}. This happens on {@{the [June solstice](June%20solstice.md)}@}. The Sun also {@{touches 90 degrees below the horizon ([nadir](nadir.md)) on the [December solstice](December%20solstice.md) in locations along the Tropic of Cancer}@}. Its [southern](south.md) equivalent is {@{the [Tropic of Capricorn](Tropic%20of%20Capricorn.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-05-09,1087,350!2028-08-10,1165,350!2029-03-03,1324,350!2028-07-22,1146,350!2029-05-22,1382,350-->

Using a continuously updated formula, the circle is {@{currently 23°26′10.0″ (or 23.43611°) [north](north.md) of the [equator](equator.md)}@}, which approximates {@{[Earth](Earth.md)'s [axial tilt](axial%20tilt.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-06,370,210!2027-04-22,768,330-->

## name

This line of [latitude](latitude.md) was named {@{after the [constellation](constellation.md) [Cancer](Cancer%20(constellation).md) during last centuries [BCE](Common%20Era..md)}@}, as {@{the [Sun](Sun.md) was there on the [June solstice](June%20solstice.md)}@}. Due to {@{westward [precession of the equinoxes](axial%20precession.md)}@}, this is {@{no longer the case}@}. The current constellation is {@{[Gemini](Gemini%20(constellation).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-05,425,290!2026-04-04,443,310!2030-04-17,1608,330!2027-03-25,416,370!2027-02-15,384,370-->
