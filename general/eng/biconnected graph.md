In {@{[graph theory](graph%20theory.md)}@}, a __biconnected graph__ is {@{a connected and "nonseparable" [graph](graph%20(discrete%20mathematics).md)}@}, meaning that {@{if any one [vertex](vertex%20(graph%20theory).md) were to be removed, the graph will remain connected}@}. Therefore {@{a biconnected graph has no [articulation vertices](biconnected%20component.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-26,4,272!2024-12-26,4,272!2024-12-26,4,270!2024-12-26,4,272-->

{@{The property of being [2-connected](k-vertex-connected%20graph.md)}@} is {@{equivalent to biconnectivity, except that the [complete graph](complete%20graph.md) of two vertices is usually not regarded as 2-connected}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-26,4,272!2024-12-26,4,272-->

This property is especially {@{useful in maintaining a graph with a two-fold [redundancy](redundancy%20(engineering).md)}@}, to {@{prevent disconnection upon the removal of a single [edge](glossary%20of%20graph%20theory.md#edge) \(or connection\)}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-26,4,272!2024-12-26,4,272-->

{@{The use of __biconnected__ graphs}@} is {@{very important in the field of networking \(see [Network flow](flow%20network.md)\)}@}, because of {@{this property of redundancy}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-26,4,272!2024-12-26,4,272!2024-12-26,4,272-->

## definition

{@{A __biconnected__ [undirected graph](graph%20(discrete%20mathematics).md#undirected%20graph)}@} is {@{a connected graph that is not broken into disconnected pieces by deleting any single vertex \(and its incident edges\)}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-26,4,272!2024-12-26,4,272-->

{@{A __biconnected__ [directed graph](directed%20graph.md)}@} is {@{one such that for any two vertices _v_ and _w_ there are two directed paths from _v_ to _w_ which have no vertices in common other than _v_ and _w_}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-26,4,272!2024-12-25,3,252-->

## structure of 2-connected graphs

{@{Every 2-connected graph}@} can be {@{constructed inductively by adding [paths](path%20(graph%20theory).md) to a [cycle](cycle%20(graph%20theory).md)}@} \([Diestel 2016](#CITEREFDiestel2016), p. 59\). <!--SR:!2024-12-26,4,272!2024-12-26,4,272-->
