# Algol paradox

In [stellar astronomy](astronomy.md#stellar%20astronomy), the __Algol paradox__ is {@{a [paradoxical](paradox.md) situation when elements of a [binary star](binary%20star.md) seem to evolve in discord with the established theories of [stellar evolution](stellar%20evolution.md)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> A fundamental feature of these theories is that {@{the rate of [evolution of stars](stellar%20evolution.md) depends on their mass: The greater the mass, the faster this evolution, and the more quickly it leaves the [main sequence](main%20sequence.md), entering either a [subgiant](subgiant.md) or [giant](giant%20star.md) phase}@}. <!--SR:!2028-09-10,1169,350!2025-09-04,310,330-->

In the case of {@{[Algol](algol.md) and other binary stars}@}, something completely different is observed: {@{The less massive star is already a subgiant, while the star with much greater mass is still on the main sequence}@}. Since {@{the partner stars of the binary are thought to have formed at approximately the same time and so should have similar ages}@}, this appears paradoxical. The more massive star, rather than the less massive one, should {@{have left the main sequence}@}. <!--SR:!2028-07-09,1117,350!2026-04-10,451,310!2028-01-24,955,330!2028-07-16,1124,350-->

The paradox is resolved by the fact that {@{in many binary stars, there can be a flow of material between the two, disturbing the normal process of stellar evolution}@}. As the flow progresses, {@{their evolutionary stage advances, even as the relative masses change}@}. Eventually, {@{the originally more massive star reaches the next stage in its evolution despite having lost much of its mass to its companion}@}. <!--SR:!2029-05-02,1352,350!2028-09-17,1176,350!2025-08-21,299,330-->
