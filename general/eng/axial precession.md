# axial precession

In [astronomy](astronomy.md), __axial precession__, is {@{a [gravity](gravity.md)-induced, slow, and continuous change in the orientation of an [astronomical body](astronomical%20object.md)'s [rotational axis](rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md)}@}. In the absence of it, {@{the astronomical object would show [axial parallelism](axial%20parallelism.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-21,184,310!2025-03-15,191,310-->

In particular, for [Earth](Earth.md), axial precession can refer to {@{the gradual shift in the orientation of Earth's axis of rotation in a cycle of approximately 26&nbsp;000 years}@}. The orientation shift follows {@{a circle in the westward direction (clockwise as seen from the north)}@}. The term "precession" only refers to {@{the largest part of the gradual motion}@}; other changes in the alignment of Earth's axis—{@{[nutation](astronomical%20nutation.md) and [polar motion](polar%20motion.md)—are much smaller in magnitude}@}. <!--SR:!2026-04-07,445,310!2026-07-07,512,310!2025-05-09,213,310!2025-08-03,299,330-->
