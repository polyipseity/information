# neutron star

A __neutron star__ is {@{the [collapsed](gravitational%20collapse.md) [core](stellar%20structure.md) of a massive [supergiant star](supergiant.md)}@}. It results from {@{the [supernova](supernova.md) explosion of a [massive star](stellar%20evolution.md#massive%20star)—combined with [gravitational collapse](gravitational%20collapse.md)—that compresses the core past [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md) star density to that of [atomic nuclei](atomic%20nucleus.md)}@}. Except for {@{[black holes](black%20hole.md)}@}, neutron stars are {@{the smallest and densest known class of stellar objects}@}. They have a radius {@{on the order of 10 kilometers (6 mi) and a mass of about 1.4 M<sub>☉</sub>}@}. Stars that collapse into neutron stars have {@{a total [mass](mass.md) of between 10 and 25 [solar masses](solar%20mass.md) (M<sub>☉</sub>)}@}, or {@{possibly more for those that are especially rich in [elements heavier than hydrogen and helium](metallicity.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-05-23,1076,350!2026-01-23,358,290!2026-09-20,589,330!2025-09-16,313,330!2027-07-26,765,290!2025-11-16,347,310!2025-08-29,276,290-->

## rotation

### spin up

Neutron star rotational speeds can {@{increase, a process known as spin up}@}. Sometimes neutron stars {@{absorb orbiting matter from companion stars}@}, increasing {@{the rotation rate and reshaping the neutron star into an [oblate spheroid](spheroid.md#oblate%20spheroids)}@}. This causes {@{an increase in the rate of rotation of the neutron star of over a hundred times per second in the case of millisecond pulsars}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-29,300,330!2026-10-05,550,310!2027-04-29,762,330!2025-09-13,287,290-->
