# gravitational redshift

In [physics](physics.md) and [general relativity](general%20relativity.md), __gravitational redshift__ (known as {@{__Einstein shift__ in older literature}@}) is {@{the phenomenon that [electromagnetic waves](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) or [photons](photon.md) travelling out of a [gravitational well](sphere%20of%20influence%20(astrodynamics).md) lose [energy](energy.md)}@}. This loss of energy corresponds to {@{a decrease in the wave [frequency](frequency.md) and increase in the [wavelength](wavelength.md), known more generally as a _[redshift](redshift.md)_}@}. The opposite effect, in which {@{photons gain energy when travelling into a gravitational well, is known as a __gravitational blueshift__ (a type of _[blueshift](redshift.md#blueshift)_)}@}. The effect was first described by {@{[Einstein](Albert%20Einstein.md) in 1907, eight years before his publication of [the full theory of relativity](general%20relativity.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-17,214,330!2025-03-17,166,310!2025-03-20,156,270!2025-09-01,301,330!2025-02-28,52,230-->
