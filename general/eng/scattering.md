# scattering

__Scattering__ describes {@{a wide range of physical processes where moving [particle](particle.md) or [radiation](radiation.md) deviates from a straight [trajectory](trajectory.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-20,365,230-->

## experiments

Scattering experiments are important in {@{discovering new particles}@} and {@{studying structure of particles}@}. Examples include {@{the [Geiger–Marsden experiments](Geiger–Marsden%20experiments.md)}@}. {@{[Laws of physics](laws%20of%20physics.md)}@} are employed in analysis. <!--SR:!2028-07-29,1530,310!2028-04-28,1462,310!2026-06-13,925,290!2025-07-29,689,312-->
