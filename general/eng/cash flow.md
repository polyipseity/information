__Cash flow__, {@{in general, refers to payments made into or out of a business, project, or financial product}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> It can also {@{refer more specifically to a real or virtual movement of [money](cash.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-17,291,330!2025-11-24,250,330-->

- Cash flow, in its narrow sense, is ::@:: a [payment](payment.md) \(in a [currency](currency.md)\), especially from one [central bank](central%20bank.md) account to another. The term 'cash flow' is mostly used to describe payments that are expected to happen in the future, are thus uncertain, and therefore need to be [forecast](cash%20flow%20forecasting.md) with cash flows. <!--SR:!2026-08-25,408,270!2025-10-22,204,310-->
- A cash flow \(CF\) is determined by ::@:: its time _t_, [nominal amount](real%20and%20nominal%20value.md) _N_, currency CCY, and account A; symbolically, CF = CF\(_t_, _N_, CCY, A\). <!--SR:!2026-04-06,320,290!2025-11-17,243,330-->

Cash flows are narrowly interconnected with {@{the concepts of [value](value%20(economics).md), interest rate, and [liquidity](liquidity.md)}@}. {@{A cash flow that shall happen on a future day _t<sub>N</sub>_}@} can be {@{transformed into a cash flow of the same value in _t_<sub>0</sub>}@}. This transformation process is known as {@{[discounting](discounting.md)}@}, and it takes into account {@{the [time value of money](time%20value%20of%20money.md) by adjusting the nominal amount of the cash flow based on the prevailing [interest rates](interest%20rate.md) at the time}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-04,257,330!2025-12-05,258,330!2025-12-25,274,330!2025-12-11,263,330!2027-01-19,547,310-->

Cash flows are often {@{transformed into measures that give information e.g. on a company's value and situation}@}: <!--SR:!2025-12-14,265,330-->

- (annotation: value) ::@:: to determine a project's [rate of return](accounting%20rate%20of%20return.md) or value. The time of cash flows into and out of projects are used as inputs in financial models such as [internal rate of return](internal%20rate%20of%20return.md) and [net present value](net%20present%20value.md). <!--SR:!2026-01-20,294,330!2025-09-13,178,310-->
- (annotation: liquidity) ::@:: to determine problems with a business's [liquidity](accounting%20liquidity.md). Being profitable does not necessarily mean being liquid. A company can fail because of a shortage of cash even while profitable. <!--SR:!2025-09-06,181,310!2025-08-17,166,310-->
- (annotation: profits) ::@:: as an alternative measure of a business's [profits](profit%20(accounting).md) when it is believed that [accrual accounting](accrual.md) concepts do not represent economic realities. For instance, a company may be notionally profitable but generating little operational cash \(as may be the case for a company that barters its products rather than selling for cash\). In such a case, the company may be deriving additional operating cash by issuing shares or raising additional debt finance. <!--SR:!2026-10-23,452,270!2025-08-14,152,270-->
- (annotation: quality) ::@:: cash flow can be used to evaluate the 'quality' of income generated by [accrual accounting](accrual.md). When net [income](income.md) is composed of large non-cash items it is considered low quality. <!--SR:!2025-08-31,176,310!2025-12-13,264,330-->
- (annotation: risk) ::@:: to evaluate the risks within a financial product, e.g., matching cash requirements, evaluating default risk, re-investment requirements, etc. <!--SR:!2025-08-21,171,310!2025-12-10,262,330-->

Cash flow notion is based {@{loosely on cash flow statement accounting standards}@}. The term is {@{flexible and can refer to time intervals spanning over past-future}@}. It can refer to {@{the total of all flows involved or a subset of those flows}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-03,192,310!2026-01-19,293,330!2025-11-20,246,330-->

Within {@{cash flow analysis}@}, {@{3 types of cash flow}@} are present and used for the cash flow statement: (annotation: they are {@{cash flow from operating, investing, financing activities}@}) <!--SR:!2026-01-18,292,330!2025-08-20,169,310!2025-11-13,239,330-->

- Cash flow from operating activities - ::@:: a measure of the cash generated by a company's regular business operations. Operating cash flow indicates whether a company can produce sufficient cash flow to cover current expenses and pay debts. <!--SR:!2025-09-02,178,310!2025-10-21,203,310-->
- Cash flow from investing activities - ::@:: the amount of cash generated from investing activities such as purchasing physical assets, investments in securities, or the sale of securities or assets. <!--SR:!2026-04-20,334,290!2026-04-17,331,290-->
- Cash flow from financing activities - ::@:: the net flows of cash that are used to fund the company. This includes transactions involving dividends, equity, and debt. <!--SR:!2025-08-17,166,310!2025-11-25,249,330-->

{@{The \(total\) net cash flow}@} of a company {@{over a period \(typically a quarter, half year, or a full year\)}@} is {@{equal to the change in cash balance over this period}@}: {@{positive if the cash balance increases \(more cash becomes available\), negative if the cash balance decreases}@}. {@{The total net cash flow for a project}@} is {@{the sum of cash flows that are classified in three areas}@}: (annotation: they are {@{operational cash flow (OCF), change in net working capital, [capital expenditure](capital%20expenditure.md)}@}) <!--SR:!2025-12-27,276,330!2025-12-12,263,330!2025-11-15,241,330!2025-11-23,249,330!2026-01-17,291,330!2026-01-19,293,330!2025-10-24,188,270-->

- [Operational cash flows](operating%20cash%20flow.md): (annotation: Not to be confused with cash flow from operations (CFO) or operating/operational cash flow (OCF) in _accounting_!!!) ::@:: cash received or expended as a result of the company's internal business activities. Operating cash flow of a project is determined by: <!--SR:!2026-12-28,528,310!2026-08-01,381,290-->
  - (annotation: OCF / incremental earnings) ::@:: OCF = incremental earnings+depreciation=\(earning before interest and tax−tax\)+depreciation <!--SR:!2025-11-14,240,330!2025-08-19,168,310-->
  - (annotation: OCF / EBIT) ::@:: OCF = earning before interest and tax\*\(1−tax rate\)+ depreciation <!--SR:!2025-09-01,177,310!2025-10-07,196,310-->
  - (annotation: OCF / full form) ::@:: OCF = \(revenue − cost of good sold − operating expense − depreciation\)\* \(1−tax rate\)+depreciation <!--SR:!2026-11-23,514,310!2026-11-21,504,310-->
  - (annotation: OCF / depreciation shield) ::@:: OCF = \(Revenue − cost of good sold − operating expense\)\* \(1−tax rate\)+ depreciation\* \(tax rate\) <!--SR:!2026-04-13,327,290!2026-11-23,499,310-->
    - Depreciation\*\(tax rate\) which locates at the end of the formula ::@:: is called depreciation shield through which we can see that there is a negative relation between depreciation and cash flow (annotation: more depreciation (more negative) means more cash flow (more positive)). <!--SR:!2025-10-31,92,375!2025-11-01,93,375-->
- Changing in net working capital: ::@:: it is the cost or revenue related to the company's short-term asset like inventory. <!--SR:!2026-11-18,502,310!2026-01-18,292,330-->
