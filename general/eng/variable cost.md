# variable cost

> [Total Costs](total%20costs.md) {@{disaggregated as [Fixed Costs](fixed%20costs.md) plus __Variable Costs__}@}. The quantity of output is {@{measured on the horizontal axis}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-11-28,249,330!2025-12-03,253,330-->

{@{__Variable costs__}@} are {@{costs that change as the quantity of the good or service that a business produces changes}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> Variable costs are {@{the sum of [marginal costs](marginal%20cost.md) over all units produced}@}. They can also be {@{considered normal costs}@}. {@{[Fixed costs](fixed%20cost.md) and variable costs}@} {@{make up the two components of [total cost](total%20cost.md)}@}. {@{__Direct costs__}@} are {@{costs that can easily be associated with a particular [cost object](cost%20object.md)}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> However, {@{not all variable costs are direct costs}@}. For example, {@{variable manufacturing [overhead](overhead%20(business).md) costs}@} are {@{variable costs that are [indirect costs](indirect%20costs.md), not direct costs}@}. Variable costs are sometimes called {@{unit-level costs as they vary with the number of units produced}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-12,260,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-12-05,255,330!2025-12-04,254,330!2025-12-02,253,330!2025-08-24,168,310!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-08-11,159,310!2025-11-26,247,330-->

{@{Direct labor and overhead}@} are often called {@{__conversion cost__}@},<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> while {@{direct material and direct labor}@} are often referred to as {@{__prime cost__}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-12-04,255,330!2025-08-16,162,310!2025-12-10,259,330-->

In {@{[marketing](marketing.md)}@}, it is {@{necessary to know how costs divide between variable and fixed}@}. This distinction is crucial in {@{forecasting the earnings generated by various changes in unit sales and thus the financial impact of proposed marketing campaigns}@}. In {@{a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers}@}, 60 percent responded that {@{they found the "variable and fixed costs" metric very useful}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-15,262,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-08-10,159,310!2025-11-09,233,330!2026-01-23,294,330-->

The level of variable cost is {@{influenced by many factors}@}, such as {@{[fixed cost](fixed%20cost.md), [duration of project](duration%20(project%20management).md), [uncertainty](uncertainty.md) and [discount rate](interest%20rate.md)}@}. {@{An analytical formula of variable cost as a function of these factors}@} has been derived. It can be used to {@{assess how different factors impact variable cost and total return in an investment}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-04,255,330!2025-08-25,171,310!2025-11-12,235,330!2025-08-25,169,310-->

## examples

Some common examples include {@{sales commission, labor costs, and the costs of [raw materials](raw%20material.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-04,106,290-->

For {@{a [business which produces clothing](clothing%20industry.md)}@}, variable cost would include {@{the direct material, i.e., cloth, and the direct labor}@}. If the business uses {@{a room, a [sewing machine](sewing%20machine.md)}@}, and 8 hours of a laborer's time with 6 yards of cloth to make a shirt, then {@{the cost of labor and cloth increases if two shirts are produced}@}, and {@{those are the variable costs}@}. {@{The facility and equipment}@} are {@{fixed costs, incurred regardless of whether even one shirt is made}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-10,259,330!2025-08-22,166,310!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-08-23,167,310!2025-12-13,261,330!2025-12-09,258,330!2026-01-23,294,330-->

The amount of materials and labor that {@{goes into each shirt increases with the number of shirts produced}@}. In this sense, {@{the cost "varies" as production varies}@}. In {@{the long run}@}, if {@{the business planned to make 0 shirts, it would choose to have 0 machines and 0 rooms}@}, but {@{in the short run, even if it produces no shirts it has incurred those costs}@}. Similarly, even if {@{the total cost of producing 1 shirt is greater than the revenue from selling the shirt}@}, the business would {@{produce the shirt anyway if the revenue were greater than the variable cost}@}. If {@{the revenue that it is receiving is greater than its variable cost but less than its total cost}@}, it will {@{continue to operate while accruing an economic loss}@}. If {@{its total revenue is less than its variable cost in the short run}@}, {@{the business should shut down}@}. If {@{revenue is greater than total cost}@}, this firm will {@{have positive economic profit}@}.<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-03,213,310!2025-12-05,255,330!2025-11-27,248,330!2025-11-12,235,330!2025-11-10,234,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-11-21,243,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-11-23,245,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-11-24,246,330-->

{@{Over a one-day horizon}@}, a factory's costs might {@{largely consist of fixed costs, not variable}@}. The company must {@{pay for the building, the employee benefits, and the machinery regardless of whether anything is produced that day}@}. {@{The main variable cost}@} will be {@{materials and any energy costs actually used in production}@}. However, {@{over a six-month horizon}@}, the factory will be {@{better able to change the amount of labor to fit the desired output}@}, either by {@{using overtime hours, laying off employees, or hiring new employees}@}. Thus, {@{much of their labor}@} becomes {@{a variable cost - though not the cost of the managers, whose salaries are paid regardless of output}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-20,266,330!2025-11-08,232,330!2025-08-26,172,310!2025-11-13,236,330!2025-11-11,235,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-11-12,236,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-09-25,193,310-->

{@{Over a five-year horizon}@}, {@{all costs can become variable costs}@}. The business can {@{decide to shut down and sell off its buildings and equipment}@} if {@{long-run total cost exceeds their long-run total revenue}@}, or to {@{expand and increase the amount of both of them}@} if {@{their long-run total revenue exceeds their long-run total cost}@}, which would {@{include their variable costs}@}. It can {@{change its entire labor force, managerial as well as line workers}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-22,244,330!2025-12-03,254,330!2025-08-22,166,310!2025-12-21,268,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-12-03,254,330!2025-12-08,257,330-->

Thus, {@{which costs are classified as variable and which as fixed}@} {@{depends on the time horizon}@}, most {@{simply classified into short run and long run}@}, but really {@{with an entire range of time horizons}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-26,149,310!2025-11-11,234,330!2025-12-07,256,330!2025-11-14,237,330-->
