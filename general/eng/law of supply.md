# law of supply

The __law of supply__ is {@{a fundamental principle of [economic theory](economics.md#theory)}@} which states that, {@{keeping other factors constant, an increase in sales price results in an increase in quantity [supplied](supply%20(economics).md)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> In other words, there is {@{a direct relationship between price and quantity: quantities respond in the same direction as price changes}@}. This means that {@{producers and manufacturers are willing to offer more of a product for sale on the [market](market%20(economics).md) at higher prices}@}, as {@{increasing production is a way of increasing profits}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-19,288,330!2025-02-05,67,310!2025-11-13,283,330!2025-04-27,115,290!2025-11-09,280,330-->

In short, the law of supply is {@{a positive relationship between quantity supplied and price}@}, and is {@{the reason for the upward slope of the supply curve}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-05,67,310!2025-02-05,67,310-->

{@{Some [heterodox economists](heterodox%20economics.md)}@}, such as [Steve Keen](Steve%20Keen.md) and [Dirk Ehnts](Dirk%20Ehnts.md), {@{dispute the law of supply, arguing that the supply curve for mass-produced goods is often downward-sloping}@}: as {@{production increases, unit prices go down, and conversely, if demand is very low, unit prices go up}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup><sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-18,287,330!2025-02-05,67,310!2025-02-05,67,310-->

## definition

A supply is {@{a good or [service](service%20(economics).md) that [producers](production%20(economics).md) are willing to provide}@}. The law of supply determines {@{the quantity of supply at a given price}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-02-05,67,310!2025-02-05,67,310-->

{@{The [law of supply and demand](supply%20and%20demand.md)}@} states that, for a given product, if {@{the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, then the price increases, which decreases the demand ([law of demand](law%20of%20demand.md)) and increases the supply (law of supply)—and vice versa}@}—until {@{the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-17,286,330!2025-02-05,67,310!2025-11-18,287,330-->

For example, a job paying £20/hr attracts {@{more interest than a job paying £15/hr}@}, and a high [interest rate](interest%20rate.md) attracts {@{lenders and deters borrowers}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,285,330!2025-11-17,286,330-->

## affecting factors

There are {@{various non-price determinants that can cause a shift in a supply curve}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> For example, if {@{the costs of production, such as wages, decrease}@}, then {@{the manufacturers can produce more goods for the same price, so the quantity supplied will increase}@}. If {@{the number of suppliers increases, or if the capacity of a factory producing the goods increases}@}, {@{the quantity supplied will increase}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-28,173,310!2025-11-19,288,330!2025-11-20,289,330!2025-11-20,289,330!2025-11-21,290,330-->

Other factors can include {@{government policy}@}—{@{government subsidies to encourage certain products decreases the overall cost of production}@}. However, {@{government [taxation](tax.md) can cause the cost of production to rise}@}. For some products, such as {@{in agriculture, the quantity supplied is dependent on the weather}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,285,330!2025-02-05,67,310!2025-02-05,67,310!2025-02-05,67,310-->
