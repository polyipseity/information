# ellipse

In [mathematics](mathematics.md), an {@{__ellipse__}@} is {@{a [plane curve](plane%20curve.md) surrounding two [focal points](focus%20(geometry).md), such that for all points on the curve, the sum of the two distances to the focal points is a constant}@}. The elongation of an ellipse is measured by {@{its [eccentricity](eccntricity%20(mathematics).md) $e$, a number ranging from $e = 0$ (the [limiting case](limiting%20case%20(mathematics).md) of a [circle](circle.md)) to $e = 1$ (the limiting case of infinite elongation, no longer an ellipse but a [parabola](parabola.md))}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-23,310,330!2025-03-13,130,270!2025-03-05,163,310-->

[Analytically](analytic%20geometry.md), the equation of a standard ellipse {@{centered at the origin with width $2w$ and height $2h$}@} is: {@{$$\frac {x^2} {w^2} + \frac {y^2} {h^2} = 1$$}@}. Assuming $w \ge h$ for the rest of this paragraph, the foci are {@{$(\pm c, 0)$ for $c = \sqrt{w^2 - h^2}$}@}. The eccentricity $e$ is {@{$\frac c w$}@}. $w$ and $h$ are also called {@{respectively [semi-major axis](semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes.md) and [semi-minor axis](semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-30,569,310!2026-09-13,602,330!2025-07-19,142,250!2025-04-02,176,270!2025-03-16,171,310-->
