# classical element

## Hellenistic philosophy

### Aristotle

In his [_On Generation and Corruption_](On%20Generation%20and%20Corruption.md), [Aristotle](Aristotle.md) related each of the four elements, {@{fire, air, water, and earth}@}, to {@{two of the four sensible qualities}@}:

- [__fire__](../../../../../general/fire%20(classical%20element).md) ::@:: both hot and dry
- [__air__](../../../../../general/air%20(classical%20element).md) ::@:: both hot and wet (for air is vapor, ἀτμὶς)
- [__water__](../../../../../general/water%20(classical%20element).md) ::@:: both cold and wet
- [__earth__](../../../../../general/earth%20(classical%20element).md) ::@:: both cold and dry

#### aether

[Aristotle](Aristotle.md) added {@{a fifth element, [aether](aether%20(classical%20element).md#fifth%20element) (αἰθήρ _aither_), as the quintessence}@}, reasoning that {@{whereas fire, earth, air, and water were earthly and corruptible, since no changes had been perceived in the heavenly regions}@}, the [stars](star.md) {@{cannot be made out of any of the four elements but must be made of a different, unchangeable, heavenly substance}@}.
