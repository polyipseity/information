# mechanical equilibrium

## stability

### equilibrium equations

For a {@{2-dimensional body}@}, there are {@{3}@} equilibrium equations available: {@{$\sum F_x = 0$, $\sum F_y = 0$, and $\sum M_{\text{any point} } = 0$}@}. This means {@{at most 3 unknown forces of a 2-dimensional system can be solved}@}, assuming {@{there are no other constraining equations}@}. This can be extrapolated {@{to lower or higher dimensions}@}. <!--SR:!2025-05-26,285,330!2025-03-19,233,330!2027-10-26,976,350!2026-10-02,654,330!2027-08-06,882,330!2025-03-10,226,330-->

### statically indeterminate system

- [statically indeterminate](statically%20indeterminate.md)

Sometimes there are {@{not enough information to determine the internal forces and [reactions](reaction%20(physics).md) of a system in equilibrium}@}. Such a system is {@{[statically indeterminate](statically%20indeterminate.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-12-07,710,330!2026-12-21,722,330-->
