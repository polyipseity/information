# ideal gas law

The __ideal gas law__, also called the __general gas equation__, is {@{the [equation of state](equation%20of%20state.md) of an [ideal gas](ideal%20gas.md)}@}. It is a combination of {@{[Avogardo's law](Avogadro's%20law.md) ($V \propto n$), [Boyle's law](Boyle's%20law.md) ($p \propto \frac 1 V$), [Charles's law](Charles's%20law.md) ($V \propto T$), and [Gay-Lussac's law](Gay-Lussac's%20law.md) ($p \propto T$)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-06-20,965,330!2026-02-13,361,190-->

## energy associated with a gas

For an ideal [monoatomic gas](monoatomic%20gas.md), {@{its [potential energy](potential%20energy.md) is zero due to the lack of [intermolecular forces](intermolecular%20force.md). Therefore, all [internal energy](internal%20energy.md) possessed by the gas is [kinetic energy](kinetic%20energy.md): $E = K = \frac32 nRT$}@}. For [ideal gases](ideal%20gas.md) with extra non-translational [degrees of freedom](degrees%20of%20freedom%20(physics%20and%20chemistry).md), {@{its [kinetic energy](kinetic%20energy.md) is still the same as above: $K = \frac32 nRT$, but its [internal energy](internal%20energy.md) is higher}@}. <!--SR:!2026-11-20,554,270!2027-01-12,816,330-->

## deviations from behavior of real gases

The ideal gas law is most accurate for {@{[monoatomic gas](monoatomic%20gas.md) at high [temperature](temperature.md) and low [pressure](pressure.md) due to the neglect of [molecular size](molecule.md#molecular%20size) and [intermolecular forces](intermolecular%20forces.md)}@}. At low [temperatures](temperature.md), {@{the [pressure](pressure.md) of a [real gas](real%20gas.md) is often lower than that of an [ideal gas](ideal%20gas.md)}@}. At high [pressures](pressure.md), {@{the [volume](volume.md) of a [real gas](real%20gas.md) is often higher than that of an [ideal gas](ideal%20gas.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-09-05,520,270!2025-06-18,364,290!2027-04-05,893,310-->
