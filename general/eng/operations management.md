## history

The history of production and operation systems begins around 5000 B.C. when [Sumerian](Sumer.md) priests developed the ancient system of recording inventories, loans, taxes, and business transactions. The next major historical application of operation systems occurred in 4000 B.C., when the [Egyptians](Egyptians.md) started using [planning](planning.md), [organization](organization.md), and [control](control%20(management).md) in large [projects](projects.md) such as the construction of the pyramids. By 1100 B.C., labor was being specialized in [China](China.md); by about 370 B.C., [Xenophon](Xenophon.md) described the advantages of dividing the various operations necessary for the production of shoes among different individuals in [ancient Greece](Ancient%20Greece.md):<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup><sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup>

"...In large cities, on the other hand, inasmuch as many people have demands to make upon each branch of industry, one trade alone, and very often even less than a whole trade, is enough to support a man: one man, for instance, makes shoes for men, and another for women; and there are places even where one man earns a living by only stitching shoes, another by cutting them out, another by sewing the uppers together, while there is another who performs none of these operations but only assembles the parts. It follows, therefore, as a matter of course, that he who devotes himself to a very highly specialized line of work is bound to do it in the best possible manner."

In the [Middle Ages](Middle%20Ages.md), kings and queens ruled over large areas of land. Loyal noblemen maintained large sections of the monarch's territory. This hierarchical organization in which people were divided into classes based on social position and wealth became known as the [feudal system](feudalism.md). In the feudal system, [vassals](vassal.md) and [serfs](serfdom.md) produced for themselves and people of higher classes by using the ruler's land and resources. Although a large part of labor was employed in agriculture, [artisans](artisans.md) contributed to economic output and formed [guilds](guilds.md). The guild system, operating mainly between 1100 and 1500, consisted of two types: merchant guilds, who bought and sold goods, and craft guilds, which made goods. Although guilds were regulated as to the quality of work performed, the resulting system was rather rigid, [shoemakers](shoemakers.md), for example, were prohibited from tanning hides.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup>

Services were also performed in the Middle Ages by servants. They provided service to the nobility in the form of cooking, cleaning and providing entertainment. Court jesters were considered service providers. The medieval army could also be considered a service since they defended the nobility.<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup>

The [Industrial Revolution](Industrial%20Revolution.md) was facilitated by two elements: interchangeability of parts and division of labor. [Division of labor](division%20of%20labor.md) has been a feature from the beginning of [civilization](civilization.md), the extent to which the division is carried out varied considerably depending on period and location. Compared to the Middle Ages, the [Renaissance](renaissance.md) and the [Age of Discovery](Age%20of%20Discovery.md) were characterized by a greater specialization in labor, which was a characteristic of the growing cities and trade networks of Europe. An important leap in manufacturing efficiency came in the late eighteenth century as [Eli Whitney](Eli%20Whitney.md) popularized the concept of [interchangeability of parts](interchangeable%20parts.md) when he manufactured 10,000 muskets. Up to this point in the history of manufacturing, each product \(e.g. each musket\) was considered a special order, meaning that parts of a given musket were fitted only for that particular musket and could not be used in other muskets. Interchangeability of parts allowed the mass production of parts independent of the final products in which they would be used. An entire new market to fill the need for the sale and manufacturing of muskets began at this time.<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup>

In 1883, [Frederick Winslow Taylor](Frederick%20Winslow%20Taylor.md) introduced the [stopwatch](stopwatch.md) method for accurately measuring the time to perform each single task of a complicated job. He developed the scientific study of productivity and identifying how to coordinate different tasks to eliminate wasting of time and increase the quality of work. The next generation of scientific study occurred with the development of [work sampling](work%20sampling.md) and [predetermined motion time systems](predetermined%20motion%20time%20systems.md) \(PMTS\). Work sampling is used to measure the random variable associated with the time of each task. PMTS allows the use of standard predetermined tables of the smallest body movements \(e.g. turning the left wrist by 90°\), and integrating them to predict the time needed to perform a simple task. PMTS has gained substantial importance due to the fact that it can predict work measurements without observing the actual work. The foundation of PMTS was laid out by the research and development of [Frank B.](Frank%20Bunker%20Gilbreth,%20Sr..md) and [Lillian M. Gilbreth](Lillian%20Moller%20Gilbreth.md) around 1912. The Gilbreths took advantage of taking motion pictures at known time intervals while operators were performing the given task.<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup>

At the turn of the twentieth century, the services industries were already developed, but largely fragmented. In 1900 the U.S. service industry consisted of banks, professional services, schools, general stores, railroads and telegraph. Services were largely local in nature \(except for railroads and telegraph\) and owned by entrepreneurs and families. The U.S. in 1900 had 31% employment in services, 31% in manufacturing and 38% in agriculture.<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup>

The idea of the [production line](production%20line.md) has been used multiple times in history prior to Henry Ford: the [Venetian Arsenal](Venetian%20Arsenal.md) \(1104\); Smith's pin manufacturing, in the _[Wealth of Nations](Wealth%20of%20Nations.md)_ \(1776\) or Brunel's [Portsmouth Block Mills](Portsmouth%20Block%20Mills.md) \(1802\). [Ransom Olds](Ransom%20Olds.md) was the first to manufacture cars using the assembly line system, but [Henry Ford](Henry%20Ford.md) developed the first auto assembly system where a car chassis was moved through the assembly line by a [conveyor belt](conveyor%20belt.md) while workers added components to it until the car was completed. During [World War II](World%20War%20II.md), the growth of computing power led to further development of efficient manufacturing methods and the use of advanced mathematical and statistical tools. This was supported by the development of academic programs in [industrial](industrial%20engineering.md) and [systems engineering](systems%20engineering.md) disciplines, as well as fields of operations research and management science \(as multi-disciplinary fields of problem solving\). While systems engineering concentrated on the broad characteristics of the relationships between inputs and outputs of generic systems, operations researchers concentrated on solving specific and focused problems. The synergy of [operations research](operations%20research.md) and systems engineering allowed for the realization of solving large scale and complex problems in the modern era. Recently, the development of faster and smaller computers, [intelligent systems](artificial%20intelligence.md), and the [World Wide Web](World%20Wide%20Web.md) has opened new opportunities for operations, manufacturing, production, and service systems.<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup>

### Industrial Revolution

Before the [First Industrial Revolution](First%20Industrial%20Revolution.md), work was mainly done through two systems: [domestic system](domestic%20system.md) and [craft guilds](craft%20guilds.md). In the domestic system [merchants](merchants.md) took materials to homes where artisans performed the necessary work, craft guilds on the other hand were associations of [artisans](artisans.md) which passed work from one shop to another, for example: leather was tanned by a [tanner](tanner%20(occupation).md), passed to [curriers](curriers.md), and finally arrived at [shoemakers](shoemakers.md) and [saddlers](saddle.md).

The beginning of the industrial revolution is usually associated with the eighteenth-century English [textile industry](textile%20industry.md), with the invention of the [flying shuttle](flying%20shuttle.md) by [John Kay](John%20Kay%20(flying%20shuttle).md) in 1733, the [spinning jenny](spinning%20jenny.md) by [James Hargreaves](James%20Hargreaves.md) in 1765, the [water frame](water%20frame.md) by [Richard Arkwright](Richard%20Arkwright.md) in 1769 and the [steam engine](steam%20engine.md) by [James Watt](James%20Watt.md) in 1765. In 1851 at the [Crystal Palace Exhibition](Crystal%20Palace%20Exhibition.md) the term [American system of manufacturing](American%20system%20of%20manufacturing.md) was used to describe the new approach that was evolving in the [United States of America](United%20States%20of%20America.md) which was based on two central features: [interchangeable parts](interchangeable%20parts.md) and extensive use of [mechanization](mechanization.md) to produce them.

### Second Industrial Revolution and post-industrial society

Henry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the [Ford Motor Company](Ford%20Motor%20Company.md) in 1903, with \$28,000 capital from twelve investors. The [model T](Model%20T.md) car was introduced in 1908, however it was not until Ford implemented the assembly line concept, that his vision of making a popular car affordable by every middle-class American citizen would be realized. The first factory in which [Henry Ford](Henry%20Ford.md) used the concept of the [assembly line](assembly%20line.md) was [Highland Park](Highland%20Park%20Ford%20Plant.md) \(1913\), he characterized the system as follows:

"The thing is to keep everything in motion and take the work to the man and not the man to the work. That is the real principle of our production, and [conveyors](conveyors.md) are only one of many means to an end"<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup>

This became one of the central ideas that led to [mass production](mass%20production.md), one of the main elements of the [Second Industrial Revolution](Second%20Industrial%20Revolution.md), along with emergence of the [electrical industry](electrical%20industry.md) and [petroleum industry](petroleum%20industry.md).

The [post-industrial economy](post-industrial%20economy.md) was noted in 1973 by Daniel Bell.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> He stated that the future economy would provide more [GDP](gross%20domestic%20product.md) and employment from services than from manufacturing and have a great effect on society. Since all sectors are highly interconnected, this did not reflect less importance for manufacturing, agriculture, and mining but just a shift in the type of economic activity.

### operations management

Although productivity benefited considerably from technological inventions and division of labor, the problem of systematic measurement of performances and the calculation of these by the use of formulas remained somewhat unexplored until [Frederick Taylor](Frederick%20Winslow%20Taylor.md), whose early work focused on developing what he called a "differential piece-rate system"<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> and a series of experiments, measurements and formulas dealing with [cutting metals](machining.md)<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> and manual labor.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> The differential [piece-rate system](piece-rate%20system.md) consisted in offering two different pay rates for doing a job: a higher rate for workers with high productivity \(efficiency\) and who produced high quality goods \(effectiveness\) and a lower rate for those who fail to achieve the standard. One of the problems Taylor believed could be solved with this system was the problem of [soldiering](soldiering.md#soldiering): faster workers reducing their production rate to that of the slowest worker.

In 1911 Taylor published his "[The Principles of Scientific Management](The%20Principles%20of%20Scientific%20Management.md)",<sup>[\[16\]](#^ref-16)</sup> in which he characterized [scientific management](scientific%20management.md) \(also known as [Taylorism](Taylorism.md)\) as:

1. The development of a true [science](science.md);
2. The scientific selection of the worker;
3. The scientific education and development of the worker;
4. Intimate friendly [cooperation](cooperation.md) between the management and the workers.

Taylor is also credited for developing stopwatch [time study](time%20and%20motion%20study.md#time%20studies). This, combined with [Frank](Frank%20Bunker%20Gilbreth.md) and [Lillian](Lillian%20Moller%20Gilbreth.md) Gilbreth [motion study](time%20and%20motion%20study.md#motion%20studies), gave way to [time and motion study](time%20and%20motion%20study.md), which is centered on the concepts of standard method and [standard time](standard%20time%20(manufacturing).md). Frank Gilbreth is also responsible for introducing the [flow process chart](flow%20process%20chart.md) in 1921.<sup>[\[17\]](#^ref-17)</sup> Other contemporaries of Taylor worth remembering are [Morris Cooke](Morris%20Cooke.md) \(rural electrification in the 1920s and implementer of Taylor's principles of scientific management in the Philadelphia's Department of Public Works\), [Carl Barth](Carl%20Barth.md) \(speed-and-feed-calculating slide rules\) and [Henry Gantt](Henry%20Gantt.md) \(Gantt chart\). Also in 1910 [Hugo Diemer](Hugo%20Diemer.md) published the first [industrial engineering](industrial%20engineering.md) book: _Factory Organization and Administration_.

In 1913 [Ford Whitman Harris](Ford%20Whitman%20Harris.md) published a paper on "How many parts to make at once", in which he presented the idea of the [economic order quantity](economic%20order%20quantity.md) model. He described the problem as follows:

"[Interest](interest.md) on capital tied up in [wages](wages.md), material and [overhead](overhead%20(business).md) sets a maximum limit to the quantity of parts which can be profitably manufactured at one time; "[setup costs](setup%20cost.md#set-up)" on the job fix the minimum. Experience has shown one manager a way to determine the economical size of lots."<sup>[\[18\]](#^ref-18)</sup>

Harris described his theory as "reasonably correct", although "not rigorously accurate".<sup>[\[18\]](#^ref-18)</sup> His paper inspired a large body of [mathematical literature](inventory%20theory.md) focusing on the problem of [production planning](production%20planning.md) and [inventory control](inventory%20control.md).<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup>

In 1924 [Walter Shewhart](Walter%20Shewhart.md) introduced the [control chart](control%20chart.md) through a technical memorandum while working at [Bell Labs](Bell%20Labs.md), central to his method was the distinction between [common cause and special cause](common%20cause%20and%20special%20cause.md) of variation. In 1931 Shewhart published his Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product,<sup>[\[19\]](#^ref-19)</sup> the first systematic treatment<sup>[\[20\]](#^ref-20)</sup> of the subject of [statistical process control](statistical%20process%20control.md) \(SPC\). He defined control:

"For our present purpose a phenomenon will be said to be controlled when, through the use of past experience, we can predict, at least within [limits](control%20limits.md#control%20limits), how the phenomenon may be expected to vary in the future. Here it is understood that prediction within limits means that we can state, at least approximately, the [probability](probability.md) that the observed phenomenon will fall within the given limits."<sup>[\[19\]](#^ref-19)</sup>

In the 1940s [methods-time measurement](methods-time%20measurement.md) \(MTM\) was developed by [H.B. Maynard](Harold%20Bright%20Maynard.md), J.L. Schwab and G.J. Stegemerten. MTM was the first of a series of [predetermined motion time systems](predetermined%20motion%20time%20systems.md), predetermined in the sense that estimates of time are not determined in loco but are derived from an industry standard. This was explained by its originators in a book they published in 1948 called _Methods-Time Measurement_.

The methods-time measurement may be defined as follows:

Methods-time measurement is a procedure which analyzes any manual operation or method into the basic motions required to perform it and assigns to each [motion](motion.md) a predetermined time standard which is determined by the nature of the motion and the conditions under which it is made.

Thus it may be seen that methods-time measurement is basically a tool of method analysis that gives answers in terms of time without the necessity of making stop-watch time studies.<sup>[\[21\]](#^ref-21)</sup>

Up to this point in history, [optimization](optimization.md) techniques were known for a very long time, from the simple methods employed by Harris to the more elaborate techniques of the [calculus of variations](calculus%20of%20variations.md) developed by [Euler](Euler.md) in 1733 or the [multipliers](Lagrange%20multipliers.md) employed by [Lagrange](Lagrange.md) in 1811, and [computers](computers.md) were slowly being developed, first as [analog computers](analog%20computers.md) by [Sir William Thomson](Sir%20William%20Thomson.md) \(1872\) and [James Thomson](James%20Thomson%20(engineer).md) \(1876\) moving to the electromechanical computers of [Konrad Zuse](Konrad%20Zuse.md) \(1939 and 1941\). During [World War II](World%20War%20II.md) however, the development of [mathematical optimization](mathematical%20optimization.md) went through a major boost with the development of the [Colossus computer](colossus%20computer.md), the first electronic digital computer that was all programmable, and the possibility to computationally solve large [linear programming](linear%20programming.md) problems, first by [Kantorovich](Kantorovich.md)<sup>[\[22\]](#^ref-22)</sup> in 1939 working for the [Soviet government](soviet%20government.md) and later in 1947 with the [simplex method](simplex%20method.md) of [Dantzig](George%20Dantzig.md). These methods are known today as belonging to the field of [operations research](operations%20research.md).

From this point on, a curious development took place: while in the United States the possibility of applying the computer to business operations led to the development of management software architecture such as [MRP](material%20requirements%20planning.md) and successive modifications, and ever more sophisticated optimization techniques and [manufacturing simulation](simulation%20of%20production%20systems.md#production) software, in post-war Japan a series of events at Toyota Motor led to the development of the [Toyota Production System](Toyota%20Production%20System.md) \(TPS\) and [lean manufacturing](lean%20manufacturing.md).

In 1943, in Japan, [Taiichi Ohno](Taiichi%20Ohno.md) arrived at [Toyota Motor](Toyota%20Motor.md) company. Toyota evolved a unique manufacturing system centered on two complementary notions: [just in time](just%20in%20time%20(business).md) \(produce only what is needed\) and [autonomation](autonomation.md) \(automation with a human touch\). Regarding JIT, Ohno was inspired by American [supermarkets](supermarkets.md):<sup>[\[23\]](#^ref-23)</sup> workstations functioned like a supermarket shelf where the customer can get products they need, at the time they need and in the amount needed, the workstation \(shelf\) is then restocked. Autonomation was developed by [Toyoda Sakichi](Toyoda%20Sakichi.md) in Toyoda Spinning and Weaving: an automatically activated loom that was also foolproof, that is automatically detected problems. In 1983 J.N Edwards published his "MRP and Kanban-American style" in which he described JIT goals in terms of seven zeros:<sup>[\[24\]](#^ref-24)</sup> zero defects, zero \(excess\) lot size, zero setups, zero breakdowns, zero handling, zero lead time and zero surging. This period also marks the spread of [total quality management](total%20quality%20management.md) \(TQM\) in Japan, ideas initially developed by American authors such as [Deming](W.%20Edwards%20Deming.md), [Juran](Joseph%20M.%20Juran.md) and [Armand V. Feigenbaum](Armand%20V.%20Feigenbaum.md).<sup>[\[25\]](#^ref-25)</sup> TQM is a strategy for implementing and managing quality improvement on an organizational basis, this includes: participation, work culture, customer focus, supplier quality improvement and integration of the quality system with business goals.<sup>[\[20\]](#^ref-20)</sup> Schnonberger identified seven fundamentals principles essential to the Japanese approach:

1. Process control: SPC and worker responsibility over quality
2. Easy able-to-see quality: boards, gauges, meters, etc. and [poka-yoke](poka-yoke.md)
3. Insistence on compliance: "quality first"
4. Line stop: stop the line to correct quality problems
5. Correcting one's own errors: worker fixed a defective part if he produced it
6. The 100% check: automated inspection techniques and foolproof machines
7. Continual improvement: ideally zero defects.<sup>[\[26\]](#^ref-26)</sup>

Meanwhile, in the sixties, a different approach was developed by George W. Plossl and Oliver W. Wight,<sup>[\[27\]](#^ref-27)</sup> this approach was continued by Joseph Orlicky as a response to the TOYOTA Manufacturing Program which led to [material requirements planning](material%20requirements%20planning.md) \(MRP\) at [IBM](IBM.md), latter gaining momentum in 1972 when the American Production and Inventory Control Society launched the "MRP Crusade". One of the key insights of this management system was the distinction between [dependent demand](dependent%20demand.md#dependent%20demand%20vs%20independent%20demand) and [independent demand](independent%20demand.md#dependent%20demand%20vs%20independent%20demand). Independent demand is demand which originates outside of the production system, therefore not directly controllable, and dependent demand is demand for components of final products, therefore subject to being directly controllable by management through the [bill of materials](bill%20of%20materials.md), via [product design](product%20design.md). Orlicky wrote "Materials Requirement Planning" in 1975,<sup>[\[28\]](#^ref-28)</sup> the first hard cover book on the subject.<sup>[\[27\]](#^ref-27)</sup> [MRP II](MRP%20II.md) was developed by Gene Thomas at IBM, and expanded the original MRP software to include additional production functions. [Enterprise resource planning](enterprise%20resource%20planning.md) \(ERP\) is the modern software architecture, which addresses, besides production operations, [distribution](distribution%20(business).md), [accounting](accounting.md), [human resources](human%20resources.md) and [procurement](procurement.md).

Dramatic changes were occurring in the service industries as well. Beginning in 1955 [McDonald's](McDonald's.md) provided one of the first innovations in service operations. McDonald's is founded on the idea of the production-line approach to service.<sup>[\[29\]](#^ref-29)</sup> This requires a standard and limited menu, an assembly-line type of production process in the back-room, high customer service in the front-room with cleanliness, courtesy and fast service. While modeled after manufacturing in the production of the food in the back-room, the service in the front-room was defined and oriented to the customer. It was the McDonald's operations system of both production and service that made the difference. McDonald's also pioneered the idea of franchising this operation system to rapidly spread the business around the country and later the world.<sup>[\[30\]](#^ref-30)</sup>

[FedEx](FedEx.md) in 1971 provided the first overnight delivery of packages in the U.S. This was based on the innovative idea of flying all packages into the single airport in Memphis Tenn by midnight each day, resorting the packages for delivery to destinations and then flying them back out the next morning for delivery to numerous locations. This concept of a fast package delivery system created a whole new industry, and eventually allowed fast delivery of online orders by Amazon and other retailers.<sup>[\[31\]](#^ref-31)</sup>

[Walmart](Walmart.md) provided the first example of very low cost retailing through design of their stores and efficient management of their entire supply chain. Starting with a single store in Roger's Arkansas in 1962, Walmart has now become the world's largest company. This was accomplished by adhering to their system of delivering the goods and the service to the customers at the lowest possible cost. The operations system included careful selection of merchandise, low cost sourcing, ownership of transportation, cross-docking, efficient location of stores and friendly home-town service to the customer.<sup>[\[32\]](#^ref-32)</sup>

In 1987 the [International Organization for Standardization](International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization.md) \(ISO\), recognizing the growing importance of quality, issued the [ISO 9000](ISO%209000.md), a family of standards related to quality management systems. There standards apply to both manufacturing and service organizations. There has been some controversy regarding the proper procedures to follow and the amount of paperwork involved, but much of that has improved in current ISO 9000 revisions.

With the coming of the Internet, in 1994 [Amazon](amazon.com.md) devised a service system of on-line retailing and distribution. With this innovative system customers were able to search for products they might like to buy, enter the order for the product, pay online, and track delivery of the product to their location, all in two days. This required not only very large computer operations, but dispersed warehouses, and an efficient transportation system. Service to customers including a high merchandise assortment, return services of purchases, and fast delivery is at the forefront of this business.<sup>[\[33\]](#^ref-33)</sup> It is the customer being in the system during the production and delivery of the service that distinguishes all services from manufacturing.

Recent trends in the field revolve around concepts such as:

- [Business process re-engineering](business%20process%20re-engineering.md) \(launched by [Michael Hammer](Michael%20Martin%20Hammer.md) in 1993<sup>[\[34\]](#^ref-34)</sup>\): a business management strategy focusing on the analysis and design of workflows and business processes within an organization. BPR seeks to help companies radically restructure their organizations by focusing on the ground-up design of their business processes.
- Lean systems is a systemic method for the elimination of waste \("[Muda](muda%20(Japanese%20term).md)"\) within a manufacturing or service process. Lean also takes into account waste created through overburden \("[Muri](muri%20(Japanese%20term).md)"\) and waste created through unevenness in work loads \("[Mura](mura%20(Japanese%20term).md)"\). The term lean manufacturing was coined in the book _[The Machine that Changed the World](The%20Machine%20That%20Changed%20the%20World%20(book).md)_.<sup>[\[35\]](#^ref-35)</sup> Subsequently, [lean services](lean%20services.md) has been widely applied.
- [Six Sigma](Six%20Sigma.md) \(an approach to quality developed at [Motorola](Motorola.md) between 1985 and 1987\): Six Sigma refers to control limits placed at six [standard deviations](standard%20deviations.md) from the mean of a [normal distribution](normal%20distribution.md), this became very famous after [Jack Welch](Jack%20Welch.md) of [General Electric](General%20Electric.md) launched a company-wide initiative in 1995 to adopt this set of methods to all manufacturing, service and administrative processes.

#### classification

A first possible distinction in production systems \({@{technological classification}@}\) is between {@{continuous process production and discrete part production}@} \([manufacturing](manufacturing.md)\). <!--SR:!2025-12-22,246,330!2026-01-30,277,330-->

- {@{Process production}@} means that {@{the product undergoes physical-chemical transformations}@} and {@{lacks assembly operations}@}, and therefore {@{the original raw materials cannot easily be obtained from the final product}@}. Examples include: {@{[paper](paper.md), [cement](cement.md), [nylon](nylon.md) and [petroleum products](petroleum%20products.md)}@}.
- {@{Part production \(e.g. cars and ovens\)}@} comprises both {@{[fabrication](manufacturing.md) systems and [assembly](assembly%20line.md) systems}@}. In the first category are {@{[job shops](job%20shops.md), [manufacturing cells](manufacturing%20cells.md), [flexible manufacturing systems](flexible%20manufacturing%20systems.md) and [transfer lines](transfer%20lines.md)}@}. In the assembly category there are {@{[fixed position](fixed%20position.md) systems, [assembly lines](assembly%20lines.md) and [assembly shops](assembly%20shops.md) \(both manual and automated operations\)}@}.<sup>[\[37\]](#^ref-37)</sup><sup>[\[38\]](#^ref-38)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-07,234,330!2025-12-13,240,330!2025-12-06,233,330!2025-12-21,246,330!2026-02-06,283,330!2026-02-13,289,330!2025-12-30,254,330!2026-10-11,407,290!2026-12-19,512,310-->

Another possible classification<sup>[\[39\]](#^ref-39)</sup> is one based on {@{[lead time](lead%20time.md) \(manufacturing lead time vs delivery lead time\)}@}: {@{[engineer to order](engineer%20to%20order.md) \(ETO\), [purchase to order](purchase%20to%20order.md) \(PTO\), [make to order](make%20to%20order.md) \(MTO\)}@}, {@{[assemble to order](assemble%20to%20order.md) \(ATO\) and [make to stock](make%20to%20stock.md) \(MTS\)}@}. According to this classification {@{different kinds of systems}@} will have {@{different customer order decoupling points \(CODP\)}@}, meaning that {@{[work in progress](work%20in%20progress.md) \(WIP\) cycle stock levels}@} are {@{practically nonexistent regarding operations located after the CODP}@} \(except for {@{[WIP](work%20in%20process.md) due to queues}@}\). \(See [Order fulfillment](order%20fulfillment.md#options).\) <!--SR:!2026-01-25,274,330!2026-08-19,339,250!2026-02-13,289,330!2025-12-26,251,330!2025-12-23,247,330!2027-12-05,789,330!2025-12-24,249,330!2026-01-19,103,385-->

{@{The concept of production systems}@} can be {@{expanded to the [service sector](service%20sector.md) world}@} keeping in mind that services have {@{some fundamental differences in respect to material goods}@}: {@{intangibility, client always present during transformation processes, no stocks for "finished goods"}@}. Services can be classified according to {@{a service process matrix}@}:<sup>[\[40\]](#^ref-40)</sup> {@{degree of labor intensity \(volume\) vs degree of customization \(variety\)}@}. With {@{a high degree of labor intensity}@} there are {@{mass services \(e.g., [commercial banking](commercial%20banking.md) bill payments and [state schools](state%20schools.md)\)}@} and {@{professional services \(e.g., personal [physicians](physicians.md) and [lawyers](lawyers.md)\)}@}, while with {@{a low degree of labor intensity}@} there are {@{service factories \(e.g., [airlines](airlines.md) and [hotels](hotels.md)\)}@} and {@{service shops \(e.g., [hospitals](hospitals.md) and [auto mechanics](auto%20mechanics.md)\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,287,330!2026-01-28,274,330!2026-02-19,293,330!2026-10-28,469,310!2025-12-25,249,330!2026-02-13,289,330!2025-12-13,240,330!2026-01-14,264,330!2026-01-28,274,330!2026-01-17,268,330!2025-12-29,253,330!2025-12-30,254,330-->

The systems described above are {@{[ideal types](ideal%20types.md)}@}: real systems {@{may present themselves as hybrids of those categories}@}. Consider, for example, that {@{the production of [jeans](jeans.md)}@} involves {@{initially [carding](carding.md), [spinning](spinning%20(textiles).md), [dyeing](dyeing.md) and [weaving](weaving.md)}@}, then {@{cutting the fabric in different shapes and assembling the parts in pants or jackets by combining the fabric with thread, zippers and buttons}@}, finally {@{[finishing](finishing%20(textiles).md) and [distressing](distressing.md) the pants/jackets before being shipped to stores}@}.<sup>[\[41\]](#^ref-41)</sup> {@{The beginning}@} can be seen as {@{process production}@}, {@{the middle as part production and the end again as process production}@}: it is unlikely that a single company will {@{keep all the stages of production under a single roof}@}, therefore the problem of {@{[vertical integration](vertical%20integration.md) and [outsourcing](outsourcing.md) arises}@}. Most products require, {@{_from a [supply chain](supply%20chain.md) perspective_, both process production and part production}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-01,254,330!2026-01-08,260,330!2026-01-27,276,330!2027-04-23,564,310!2025-11-16,185,270!2026-02-05,282,330!2025-12-31,255,330!2025-12-19,245,330!2026-05-22,352,310!2025-12-23,247,330!2027-10-09,748,330!2028-01-11,819,330-->

##### service operations

- Main article: ::@:: [Operations management for services](operations%20management%20for%20services.md) <!--SR:!2026-01-28,274,330!2025-12-23,247,330-->

{@{[Service industries](service%20industries.md)}@} are {@{a major part of economic activity and employment in all industrialized countries}@} comprising {@{80 percent of employment and GDP}@} in {@{the U.S. Operations management of these services}@}, as distinct from {@{manufacturing}@}, has been {@{developing since the 1970s through publication of unique practices and academic research}@}.<sup>[\[42\]](#^ref-42)</sup> Please note that this section does not particularly include "Professional Services Firms" and the professional services practiced from this expertise \(specialized training and education within\). <!--SR:!2026-02-07,284,330!2026-02-06,283,330!2026-01-24,273,330!2025-12-18,244,330!2026-02-08,285,330!2027-12-29,809,330-->

According to Fitzsimmons, Fitzsimmons and Bordoloi \(2014\) {@{differences between manufactured goods and services}@} are as follows:<sup>[\[43\]](#^ref-43)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-10,286,330-->

- {@{_Simultaneous production and consumption._}@} {@{High contact services \(e.g. health care\)}@} must be {@{produced in the presence of the customer}@}, since {@{they are consumed as produced}@}. As a result, services cannot be {@{produced in one location and transported to another, like goods}@}. Service operations are therefore {@{highly dispersed geographically close to the customers}@}. Furthermore, {@{simultaneous production and consumption}@} allows {@{the possibility of self-service}@} involving {@{the customer at the point of consumption \(e.g. gas stations\)}@}. {@{Only low-contact services produced in the "backroom" \(e.g., check clearing\)}@} can be {@{provided away from the customer}@}.
- {@{_Perishable._}@} Since {@{services are perishable}@}, they cannot be {@{stored for later use}@}. In {@{manufacturing companies}@}, inventory can be {@{used to buffer supply and demand}@}. Since {@{buffering is not possible in services}@}, {@{highly variable demand}@} must be {@{met by operations or demand modified to meet supply}@}.
- {@{_Ownership._}@} In {@{manufacturing}@}, ownership is {@{transferred to the customer}@}. Ownership is {@{not transferred for service}@}. As a result, services cannot be {@{owned or resold}@}.
- {@{_Tangibility._}@} {@{A service is intangible}@} making it {@{difficult for a customer to evaluate the service in advance}@}. In {@{the case of a manufactured good}@}, customers can {@{see it and evaluate it}@}. {@{Assurance of quality service}@} is often {@{done by licensing, government regulation, and branding}@} to {@{assure customers they will receive a quality service}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-06,283,330!2026-01-26,275,330!2025-12-05,232,330!2025-12-02,229,330!2025-12-21,246,330!2025-12-13,240,330!2025-12-27,251,330!2025-12-22,247,330!2025-12-31,255,330!2027-12-16,794,330!2026-02-03,280,330!2025-12-20,246,330!2026-02-18,292,330!2026-02-14,290,330!2026-02-18,292,330!2026-01-01,254,330!2026-02-10,286,330!2025-12-27,251,330!2026-02-03,281,330!2026-02-09,285,330!2026-02-01,278,330!2025-12-11,238,330!2026-02-09,285,330!2026-02-11,287,330!2026-01-29,276,330!2025-12-27,251,330!2026-02-07,284,330!2026-02-15,289,330!2026-02-12,288,330!2026-01-31,278,330!2026-02-10,286,330!2025-12-20,246,330-->

These four comparisons indicate {@{how management of service operations are quite different from manufacturing regarding}@} such issues as {@{capacity requirements \(highly variable\), quality assurance \(hard to quantify\)}@}, {@{location of facilities \(dispersed\), and interaction with the customer during delivery of the service \(product and process design\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-06,283,330!2028-01-02,809,330!2026-05-18,335,290-->

While there are differences {@{there are also many similarities}@}. For example, {@{quality management approaches used in manufacturing}@} such as {@{the Baldrige Award, and [Six Sigma](Six%20Sigma.md)}@} have been {@{widely applied to services}@}. Likewise, {@{[lean service](lean%20services.md) principles and practices}@} have {@{also been applied in service operations}@}. {@{The important difference}@} being {@{the customer is in the system while the service is being provided}@} and needs to be {@{considered when applying these practices}@}.<sup>[\[44\]](#^ref-44)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-20,294,330!2026-01-31,277,330!2028-01-18,825,330!2026-02-01,278,330!2026-02-15,289,330!2026-02-02,279,330!2026-01-27,276,330!2025-12-21,245,330!2026-01-24,273,330-->

One important difference is {@{service recovery}@}. When {@{an error occurs in service delivery}@}, the recovery must be {@{delivered on the spot by the service provider}@}. If {@{a waiter in a restaurant spills soup on the customer's lap}@}, then the recovery could include {@{a free meal and a promise of free dry cleaning}@}. Another difference is {@{in planning capacity}@}. Since {@{the product cannot be stored}@}, {@{the service facility}@} must be {@{managed to peak demand which requires more flexibility than manufacturing}@}. {@{Location of facilities}@} must be {@{near the customers and scale economics can be lacking}@}. Scheduling must consider {@{the customer can be waiting in line}@}. {@{Queuing theory}@} has been devised to {@{assist in design of service facilities waiting lines}@}. {@{Revenue management}@} is {@{important for service operations}@}, since {@{empty seats on an airplane are lost revenue}@} when {@{the plane departs and cannot be stored for future use}@}.<sup>[\[45\]](#^ref-45)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-04,281,330!2026-01-02,255,330!2026-01-27,276,330!2026-02-17,291,330!2026-01-25,274,330!2026-01-26,275,330!2026-02-09,285,330!2025-12-12,239,330!2026-01-27,276,330!2026-01-10,260,330!2026-01-28,274,330!2026-02-12,288,330!2025-12-24,248,330!2025-12-20,246,330!2026-01-30,276,330!2026-01-28,275,330!2026-02-11,287,330!2026-01-30,276,330-->

### metrics: efficiency and effectiveness

{@{Operations strategy}@} concerns {@{policies and plans of use of the firm productive resources}@} with the aim of {@{supporting long term competitive strategy}@}. {@{Metrics in operations management}@} can be broadly classified into {@{[efficiency](efficiency.md) metrics and [effectiveness](effectiveness.md) metrics}@}. {@{Effectiveness metrics}@} involve: \(annotation: 6 items: {@{price, quality, time}@}, {@{flexibility, stock availability, ecological soundness}@}\) <!--SR:!2026-02-14,290,330!2026-02-08,285,330!2025-12-30,254,330!2026-01-30,276,330!2025-12-27,251,330!2026-10-26,408,270!2026-01-19,103,385!2026-01-19,103,385-->

4.

A more recent approach, introduced by Terry Hill,<sup>[\[46\]](#^ref-46)</sup> involves {@{distinguishing competitive variables in order winner and order qualifiers when defining operations strategy}@}. {@{Order winners}@} are {@{variables which permit differentiating the company from competitors}@}, while {@{order qualifiers}@} are {@{prerequisites for engaging in a transaction}@}. This view can be seen as {@{a unifying approach}@} between {@{operations management and [marketing](marketing.md)}@} \(see [segmentation](market%20segment.md) and [positioning](positioning%20(marketing).md)\). <!--SR:!2027-05-28,588,310!2026-01-31,277,330!2028-01-05,814,330!2026-01-24,273,330!2026-02-08,285,330!2026-01-01,254,330!2026-01-27,276,330-->

{@{[Productivity](productivity.md)}@} is {@{a standard efficiency metric for evaluation of production systems}@}, broadly speaking {@{a ratio between outputs and inputs}@}, and can {@{assume many specific forms}@},<sup>[\[47\]](#^ref-47)</sup> for example: {@{machine productivity, workforce productivity, raw material productivity, warehouse productivity \(=[inventory turnover](inventory%20turnover.md)\)}@}. It is also useful to {@{break up productivity}@} in {@{use U \(productive percentage of total time\) and yield η \(ratio between produced volume and productive time\)}@} to {@{better evaluate production systems performances}@}. {@{Cycle times}@} can be {@{modeled through [manufacturing](manufacturing.md) engineering}@} if {@{the individual operations are heavily automated}@}, if {@{the manual component is the prevalent one}@}, methods used include: {@{[time and motion study](time%20and%20motion%20study.md), [predetermined motion time systems](predetermined%20motion%20time%20systems.md) and [work sampling](work%20sampling.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-01,278,330!2026-01-29,276,330!2025-12-29,253,330!2026-01-29,276,330!2026-02-03,264,290!2026-02-05,282,330!2026-08-08,413,310!2027-12-06,788,330!2026-02-11,285,330!2027-12-28,805,330!2026-02-03,280,330!2026-01-25,274,330!2027-11-29,781,330-->
