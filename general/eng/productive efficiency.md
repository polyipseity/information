In {@{[microeconomic theory](microeconomics.md)}@}, {@{__productive efficiency__ \(or __production efficiency__\)}@} is {@{a situation in which the [economy](economy.md) or an [economic system](economic%20system.md) \(e.g., bank, hospital, industry, country\) operating within the constraints of current [industrial technology](industrial%20technology.md)}@} {@{cannot increase [production](production%20(economics).md) of one [good](goods.md) without sacrificing production of another good}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> In simple terms, the concept is illustrated on {@{a [production possibility frontier](production–possibility%20frontier.md) \(PPF\)}@}, where {@{all points on the curve are points of productive efficiency}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> {@{An [equilibrium](economic%20equilibrium.md)}@} may be {@{productively efficient without being [allocatively efficient](allocative%20efficiency.md)}@} — i.e. it may result in {@{a distribution of goods where [social welfare](welfare%20spending.md) is not maximized}@} \(bearing in mind that {@{social welfare}@} is {@{a nebulous [objective function](loss%20function.md) subject to political controversy}@}\). <!--SR:!2026-09-30,501,310!2029-03-22,1237,350!2027-09-09,773,330!2025-11-15,282,330!2027-08-27,763,330!2025-11-18,284,330!2029-03-25,1240,350!2025-11-11,20,361!2025-11-10,19,361!2025-11-11,20,361!2025-11-11,20,361-->

Productive efficiency is {@{an aspect of [economic efficiency](economic%20efficiency.md)}@} that focuses on {@{how to maximize output of a chosen product portfolio, without concern for whether your product portfolio is making goods in the right proportion}@}; in misguided application, it will aid in {@{manufacturing the wrong basket of outputs faster and cheaper than ever before}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-03,1055,350!2028-01-08,865,330!2027-05-31,708,330-->

{@{Productive efficiency of an industry}@} requires that {@{all firms operate using best-practice technological and [managerial](management.md) processes}@} and that there is {@{no further reallocation that bring more output with the same inputs and the same production technology}@}. By {@{improving these processes}@}, an economy or business can {@{extend its production possibility frontier outward}@}, so that {@{efficient production yields more output than previously}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-20,654,330!2028-11-23,1145,350!2027-06-16,719,330!2025-11-05,275,330!2027-03-09,645,330!2028-12-07,1155,350-->

{@{Productive inefficiency, with the economy operating below its production possibilities frontier}@}, can occur because {@{the productive inputs [physical capital](physical%20capital.md) and [labor](workforce.md) are underutilized}@}—that is, {@{some capital or labor is left sitting idle—or because these inputs are allocated in inappropriate combinations to the different industries that use them}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-27,292,330!2029-03-26,1240,350!2026-11-03,528,310-->

In {@{[long-run equilibrium](long%20run%20and%20short%20run.md) for perfectly competitive markets}@}, productive efficiency occurs at {@{[the base](perfect%20competition.md#results) of the [average total cost curve](average%20cost.md)}@} — i.e. where {@{[marginal cost](marginal%20cost.md) equals average total cost — for each good}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-08,275,330!2027-03-18,653,330!2027-03-01,639,330-->

Due to {@{the nature and culture of [monopolistic](monopoly.md) companies}@}, they may {@{not be productively efficient because of [X-inefficiency](X-inefficiency.md)}@}, whereby {@{companies operating in a monopoly have less of an incentive to maximize output due to lack of competition}@}. However, due to {@{[economies of scale](economies%20of%20scale.md)}@} it can be possible for {@{the profit-maximizing level of output of monopolistic companies to occur}@} with {@{a lower price to the consumer than perfectly competitive companies}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-16,282,330!2027-06-21,709,330!2026-03-17,138,310!2027-06-02,707,330!2028-09-24,1097,350!2025-11-03,273,330-->

## theoretical measures

{@{Many theoretical measures of production efficiency}@} have been proposed in the literature as well as {@{many approaches to estimate them}@}. <!--SR:!2029-03-15,1231,350!2028-09-16,1090,350-->

{@{The most popular measures of efficiency}@} include {@{Farrell measure<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> (also known as Debreu–Farrell measure, since Debreu (1951) has similar ideas<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup>)}@}. This measure is also {@{the reciprocal of the Shephard's distance function}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> These can be defined with either {@{the input orientation (fix outputs and measure maximal possible reduction in inputs)}@} or {@{the output orientation (fix inputs and measure maximal possible expansion in outputs)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-28,293,330!2026-06-15,351,250!2026-07-24,451,310!2025-11-29,294,330!2025-11-04,274,330-->

{@{A generalisation of these}@} is {@{the so-called directional distance function}@}, where {@{one can select any direction (or orientation) for measuring the production efficiency}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-24,1071,350!2025-11-28,293,330!2025-11-17,283,330-->

{@{The most popular for estimating production efficiency}@} are {@{[data envelopment analysis](data%20envelopment%20analysis.md)<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> and [stochastic frontier analysis](stochastic%20frontier%20analysis.md)}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-06,276,330!2026-02-08,323,290-->

See the recent book by Sickles and Zelenyuk (2019) for comprehensive coverage of the theory<!-- <sup>[_[which?](Wikipedia:Manual%20of%20Style_Words%20to%20watch.md#unsupported%20attributions)_]</sup> --> and related estimation and many references therein.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup>
