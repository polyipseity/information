# inclusion–exclusion principle

In [combinatorics](combinatorics.md), a branch of [mathematics](mathematics.md), the __inclusion–exclusion principle__ is {@{a counting technique}@} which {@{generalizes the familiar method of obtaining the number of elements in the [union](union%20(set%20theory).md) of two [finite sets](finite%20set.md)}@}; symbolically expressed as {@{$$|A\cup B|=|A|+|B|-|A\cap B|$$}@} where {@{_A_ and _B_ are two finite sets and |_S_| indicates the [cardinality](cardinality.md) of a set _S_}@} (which may be {@{considered as the number of elements of the set, if the set is [finite](finite%20set.md)}@}). The formula expresses the fact that {@{the sum of the sizes of the two sets may be too large since some elements may be counted twice}@}. The double-counted elements are {@{those in the [intersection](intersection%20(set%20theory).md) of the two sets}@} and the count is {@{corrected by subtracting the size of the intersection}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-31,349,351!2029-12-02,1472,360!2025-12-24,342,351!2029-12-03,1473,360!2030-02-18,1533,360!2025-12-28,346,351!2025-12-24,342,351!2027-04-01,670,320-->

The inclusion-exclusion principle, being {@{a generalization of the two-set case}@}, is perhaps more clearly seen in the case of three sets, which for the sets _A_, _B_ and _C_ is given by {@{$$|A\cup B\cup C|=|A|+|B|+|C|-|A\cap B|-|A\cap C|-|B\cap C|+|A\cap B\cap C|$$}@} This formula can be verified by {@{counting how many times each region in the [Venn diagram](Venn%20diagram.md) figure is included in the right-hand side of the formula}@}. In this case, when {@{removing the contributions of over-counted elements}@}, the number of elements in {@{the mutual intersection of the three sets has been subtracted too often}@}, so {@{must be added back in to get the correct total}@}. <!--SR:!2029-11-09,1454,360!2026-01-02,351,351!2025-12-25,343,351!2029-09-06,1395,350!2026-01-01,350,351!2025-12-26,345,351-->

{@{Generalizing the results of these examples}@} gives the principle of inclusion–exclusion. To {@{find the cardinality of the union of _n_ sets}@}: <!--SR:!2030-03-16,1554,360!2025-12-31,349,351-->

1. Include the cardinalities of the sets.
2. Exclude the cardinalities of the pairwise intersections.
3. Include the cardinalities of the triple-wise intersections.
4. Exclude the cardinalities of the quadruple-wise intersections.
5. Include the cardinalities of the quintuple-wise intersections.
6. Continue, until the cardinality of the _n_-tuple-wise intersection is included (if _n_ is odd) or excluded (_n_ even).

The name comes from the idea that {@{the principle is based on over-generous _inclusion_, followed by compensating _exclusion_}@}. This concept is attributed to [Abraham de Moivre](Abraham%20de%20Moivre.md) (1718),<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> although it first appears in a paper of [Daniel da Silva](Daniel%20da%20Silva%20(mathematician).md) (1854)<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> and later in a paper by [J. J. Sylvester](James%20Joseph%20Sylvester.md) (1883).<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> Sometimes the principle is referred to as the formula of Da Silva or Sylvester, due to these publications. The principle can be viewed as {@{an example of the [sieve method](sieve%20theory.md) extensively used in [number theory](number%20theory.md) and is sometimes referred to as the _sieve formula_}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-30,348,351!2028-11-29,1161,351-->

As {@{finite probabilities are computed as counts relative to the cardinality of the [probability space](probability%20space.md)}@}, the formulas for the principle of inclusion–exclusion {@{remain valid when the cardinalities of the sets are replaced by finite probabilities}@}. More generally, both versions of the principle can be {@{put under the common umbrella of [measure theory](measure%20(mathematics).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-01,350,351!2029-08-26,1386,350!2025-12-21,340,351-->

In a very abstract setting, the principle of inclusion–exclusion can be expressed as {@{the calculation of the inverse of a certain matrix}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> This inverse has {@{a special structure}@}, making the principle {@{an extremely valuable technique in combinatorics and related areas of mathematics}@}. As [Gian-Carlo Rota](Gian-Carlo%20Rota.md) put it:<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-30,348,351!2030-02-14,1530,360!2027-05-01,694,320-->

> "One of the most useful principles of enumeration in discrete probability and combinatorial theory is the celebrated principle of inclusion–exclusion. When skillfully applied, this principle has yielded the solution to many a combinatorial problem."

## formula

In its general formula, the principle of inclusion–exclusion states that for {@{finite sets _A_<sub>1</sub>, ..., _A<sub>n</sub>_}@}, one has {@{the identity $$\left|\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\right|=\sum _{i=1}^{n}|A_{i}|-\sum _{1\leqslant i<j\leqslant n}|A_{i}\cap A_{j}|+\sum _{1\leqslant i<j<k\leqslant n}|A_{i}\cap A_{j}\cap A_{k}|-\cdots +(-1)^{n+1}\left|A_{1}\cap \cdots \cap A_{n}\right|. \qquad \textbf{(1)}$$ <a id="math_1"></a>}@} This can be compactly written as {@{$$\left|\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\right|=\sum _{k=1}^{n}(-1)^{k+1}\left(\sum _{1\leqslant i_{1}<\cdots <i_{k}\leqslant n}|A_{i_{1} }\cap \cdots \cap A_{i_{k} }|\right)$$}@} or {@{$$\left|\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\right|=\sum _{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,\ldots ,n\} }(-1)^{|J|+1}\left|\bigcap _{j\in J}A_{j}\right|.$$}@} In words, to {@{count the number of elements in a finite union of finite sets}@}, first {@{sum the cardinalities of the individual sets, then subtract the number of elements that appear in at least two sets, then add back the number of elements that appear in at least three sets, then subtract the number of elements that appear in at least four sets, and so on}@}. This process always {@{ends since there can be no elements that appear in more than the number of sets in the union}@}. (For example, if $n=4,$ there can be no elements that appear in more than $4$ sets; equivalently, there can be no elements that appear in at least $5$ sets.) <!--SR:!2029-11-29,1471,360!2027-05-12,718,331!2029-05-16,1246,320!2025-12-23,342,351!2029-12-09,1478,360!2025-12-24,343,351!2028-10-17,1062,340-->

In applications it is common to see {@{the principle expressed in its complementary form}@}. That is, letting {@{_S_ be a finite [universal set](universal%20set.md) containing all of the _A<sub>i</sub>_ and letting ${\bar {A_{i} } }$ denote the complement of _A<sub>i</sub>_ in _S_}@}, by {@{[De Morgan's laws](De%20Morgan's%20laws.md)}@} we have {@{$$\left|\bigcap _{i=1}^{n}{\bar {A_{i} } }\right|=\left|S-\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\right|=|S|-\sum _{i=1}^{n}|A_{i}|+\sum _{1\leqslant i<j\leqslant n}|A_{i}\cap A_{j}|-\cdots +(-1)^{n}|A_{1}\cap \cdots \cap A_{n}|.$$}@} As another variant of the statement, let {@{_P_<sub>1</sub>, ..., _P<sub>n</sub>_ be a list of properties that elements of a set _S_ may or may not have}@}, then the principle of inclusion–exclusion provides a way to {@{calculate the number of elements of _S_ that have none of the properties}@}. Just let {@{_A<sub>i</sub>_ be the subset of elements of _S_ which have the property _P<sub>i</sub>_ and use the principle in its complementary form}@}. This variant is due to [J. J. Sylvester](James%20Joseph%20Sylvester.md).<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-01,350,351!2026-01-04,353,351!2029-08-28,1387,350!2025-12-29,347,351!2025-12-22,341,351!2025-12-29,347,351!2028-08-01,1081,351-->

Notice that if {@{you take into account only the first _m<n_ sums on the right (in the general form of the principle)}@}, then {@{you will get an overestimate if _m_ is odd and an underestimate if _m_ is even}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-04,353,351!2028-03-04,931,330-->

## examples

### counting derangements

A more complex example is the following.

Suppose there is {@{a deck of _n_ cards numbered from 1 to _n_}@}. Suppose a card numbered _m_ is {@{in the correct position if it is the _m<sup>th</sup>_ card in the deck}@}. How many ways, _W_, can {@{the cards be shuffled with at least 1 card being in the correct position}@}? <!--SR:!2028-10-01,1050,340!2029-11-19,1462,360!2029-11-13,1457,360-->

Begin by {@{defining set _A_<sub>_m_</sub>, which is all of the orderings of cards with the _m<sup>th</sup>_ card correct}@}. Then {@{the number of orders, _W_, with _at least_ one card being in the correct position, _m_}@}, is {@{$$W=\left|\bigcup _{m=1}^{n}A_{m}\right|.$$}@} Apply the principle of inclusion–exclusion, {@{$$W=\sum _{m_{1}=1}^{n}|A_{m_{1} }|-\sum _{1\leqslant m_{1}<m_{2}\leqslant n}|A_{m_{1} }\cap A_{m_{2} }|+\cdots +(-1)^{p-1}\sum _{1\leqslant m_{1}<\cdots <m_{p}\leqslant n}|A_{m_{1} }\cap \cdots \cap A_{m_{p} }|+\cdots$$}@} Each value $A_{m_{1} }\cap \cdots \cap A_{m_{p} }$ represents {@{the set of shuffles having at least _p_ values _m_<sub>1</sub>, ..., _m<sub>p</sub>_ in the correct position}@}. Note that the number of shuffles with at least _p_ values correct only {@{depends on _p_, not on the particular values of $m$}@}. For example, {@{the number of shuffles having the 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 17<sup>th</sup> cards in the correct position is the same as the number of shuffles having the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 13<sup>th</sup> cards in the correct positions}@}. It only matters that {@{of the _n_ cards, 3 were chosen to be in the correct position}@}. Thus there are {@{${n \choose p}$ equal terms in the _p<sup>th</sup>_ summation}@} (see [combination](combination.md)). {@{$$W={n \choose 1}|A_{1}|-{n \choose 2}|A_{1}\cap A_{2}|+\cdots +(-1)^{p-1}{n \choose p}|A_{1}\cap \cdots \cap A_{p}|+\cdots$$}@} $|A_{1}\cap \cdots \cap A_{p}|$ is {@{the number of orderings having _p_ elements in the correct position}@}, which is {@{equal to the number of ways of ordering the remaining _n_ − _p_ elements, or (_n_ − _p_)!}@}. Thus we finally get: {@{$${\begin{aligned}W&={n \choose 1}(n-1)!-{n \choose 2}(n-2)!+\cdots +(-1)^{p-1}{n \choose p}(n-p)!+\cdots \\&=\sum _{p=1}^{n}(-1)^{p-1}{n \choose p}(n-p)!\\&=\sum _{p=1}^{n}(-1)^{p-1}{\frac {n!}{p!(n-p)!} }(n-p)!\\&=\sum _{p=1}^{n}(-1)^{p-1}{\frac {n!}{p!} }\end{aligned} }$$}@} {@{A permutation where _no_ card is in the correct position}@} is {@{called a [derangement](derangement.md)}@}. Taking {@{_n_! to be the total number of permutations}@}, {@{the probability _Q_ that a random shuffle produces a derangement}@} is given by {@{$$Q=1-{\frac {W}{n!} }=\sum _{p=0}^{n}{\frac {(-1)^{p} }{p!} },$$}@} {@{a truncation to _n_ + 1 terms of the [Taylor expansion](taylor%20series.md) of _e_<sup>−1</sup>}@}. Thus {@{the probability of guessing an order for a shuffled deck of cards and being incorrect about every card}@} is {@{approximately _e_<sup>−1</sup> or 37%}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-22,340,351!2030-05-28,1623,371!2029-11-14,1458,360!2029-11-21,1464,360!2026-01-04,353,351!2025-12-31,349,351!2025-12-19,338,351!2029-12-10,1479,360!2027-04-19,688,331!2027-02-28,655,320!2028-01-20,915,330!2030-04-12,1577,360!2026-08-09,445,290!2025-12-24,343,351!2029-12-04,1474,360!2029-09-12,1399,350!2025-12-26,344,351!2028-01-01,857,311!2026-01-03,352,351!2028-01-08,901,330!2026-01-05,354,351-->

## a special case

The situation that appears in the derangement example above {@{occurs often enough to merit special attention}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> Namely, when {@{the size of the intersection sets appearing in the formulas for the principle of inclusion–exclusion depend only on the number of sets in the intersections and not on which sets appear}@}.

## formula generalization

Given {@{a [family (repeats allowed) of subsets](family%20of%20sets.md) _A_<sub>1</sub>, _A_<sub>2</sub>, ..., _A_<sub>n</sub> of a universal set _S_}@}, the principle of inclusion–exclusion calculates {@{the number of elements of _S_ in none of these subsets}@}.

Let {@{_N_ = [_n_] = {1,2,...,_n_} be the index set}@}. If we define {@{$A_{\emptyset }=S$}@}, then the principle of inclusion–exclusion can be written as, using the notation of the previous section; {@{the number of elements of _S_ contained in none of the _A_<sub>i</sub>}@} is: {@{$$\left\lvert S \smallsetminus \bigcup_{i = 1}^n A_i \right\rvert = \sum _{J\subseteq [n]}(-1)^{|J|}|A_{J}|.$$ (Example of interpreting $A_J$: $A_{\set{1, 4, 5} } = A_1 \cap A_4 \cap A_5$)}@} If {@{_I_ is a fixed subset of the index set _N_ (choose fixed _m_ subsets from a family of subsets)}@}, then {@{the number of elements which belong to _A_<sub>i</sub> for all _i_ in _I_ and for no other values is}@}:<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> {@{$$\left\lvert A_I \smallsetminus \bigcup_{i \in N \smallsetminus I} A_i \right\rvert = \sum _{I\subseteq J}(-1)^{|J|-|I|}|A_{J}|.$$ (Note that $J \subseteq [n]$.)}@} Define the sets {@{$$B_{k}=A_{I\cup \{k\} }{\text{ for } }k\in N\smallsetminus I.$$}@} (annotation: This definition is {@{reframing $A_I$ as the new "universal set" $S$}@}.) We seek {@{the number of elements in none of the _B_<sub>k</sub>}@} which, by {@{the principle of inclusion–exclusion}@} (with $B_{\emptyset }=A_{I}$), is {@{$$\left\lvert B_\emptyset \smallsetminus \bigcup_{i \in N \smallsetminus I} B_i \right\rvert = \sum _{K\subseteq N\smallsetminus I}(-1)^{|K|}|B_{K}|.$$ (Example of interpreting $B_K$: $B_{\set{1, 4, 5} } = B_1 \cap B_4 \cap B_5$)}@} (annotation: This is {@{simply repeating the first equation in this section but with $B_\emptyset = A_I$ as the "universal set" $S$ instead}@}.) {@{The correspondence _K_ ↔ _J_ = _I_ ∪ _K_ between subsets of _N_ \ _I_ and subsets of _N_ containing _I_}@} is {@{a bijection}@} and if {@{_J_ and _K_ correspond under this map}@} then {@{_B_<sub>_K_</sub> = _A_<sub>_J_</sub>, showing that the result is valid}@}. <!--SR:!2030-02-19,1534,360!2029-10-05,1416,350!2025-12-23,342,351!2026-01-05,354,351!2029-06-30,1338,350!2025-12-27,346,351!2027-01-06,598,310!2029-11-28,1470,360!2028-02-04,927,330!2029-12-06,1477,360!2029-07-30,1363,350!2028-05-06,988,340!2028-03-26,948,330!2026-01-01,350,351!2028-11-28,1160,351!2027-01-20,609,310!2025-12-24,342,351-->

Equivalently, each element {@{does not belong to the sets indexed by $S$ and _only_ does not belong to the sets indexed by $S$}@}. For example, if $\underline m = \set{1, 2}$ and $S = \set{1}$, then each element {@{belongs to $A_2$ and to $A_2$ only}@}. So {@{an element that does not belong to $A_2$}@} is excluded. An element {@{that belongs to $A_1$, no matter if it belongs to $A_2$}@}, is also excluded.)

(annotation: Consider this from {@{the perspective of an element}@}. Each element can {@{belong to 0 or more sets}@}. So we can assign each element a _membership_ property that is {@{the index set of the sets it belongs to}@}. Then, $f(S)$, which uses the $\cap \smallsetminus \cup$ formula, is {@{counting the number of elements with a specific membership property value}@}. This cannot {@{double count}@} because an element {@{cannot have multiple values for its membership property}@}. So $g(S)$, which sums $f(S)$ over all possible subsets of $S$, properly yields {@{the size of elements that at least belong to all sets not indexed by $S$}@}.

## applications

The inclusion–exclusion principle is widely used and only a few of its applications can be mentioned here.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD024 -->
### counting derangements

- see: [derangement](derangement.md)

<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD059 -->

A well-known application of the inclusion–exclusion principle is to {@{the combinatorial problem of counting all [derangements](derangement.md) of a finite set}@}. A _derangement_ of a set _A_ is {@{a [bijection](bijection.md) from _A_ into itself that has no fixed points}@}. Via the inclusion–exclusion principle one can show that if {@{the cardinality of _A_ is _n_}@}, then {@{the number of derangements is [_n_! / _e_] where [_x_] denotes the [nearest integer](rounding.md#rounding%20to%20the%20nearest%20integer) to _x_}@}; a detailed proof is available [here](random%20permutation%20statistics.md#number%20of%20permutations%20that%20are%20derangements) and also see [the examples section](#examples) above. <!--SR:!2025-12-26,345,351!2025-12-28,346,351!2030-03-20,1557,360!2028-01-08,904,330-->

<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

The first occurrence of the problem of counting the number of derangements is in an early book on games of chance: _Essai d'analyse sur les jeux de hazard_ by P. R. de Montmort (1678 – 1719) and was known as either "Montmort's problem" or by the name he gave it, "_problème des rencontres_."<sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> The problem is also known as the _hatcheck problem._

The number of derangements is also known as {@{the [subfactorial](derangement.md) of _n_, written !_n_}@}. It follows that if {@{all bijections are assigned the same probability}@} then {@{the probability that a random bijection is a derangement quickly approaches 1/_e_ as _n_ grows}@}. <!--SR:!2030-04-01,1568,360!2028-03-21,944,330!2026-01-02,351,351-->

### counting intersections

The principle of inclusion–exclusion, combined with {@{[De Morgan's law](De%20Morgan's%20laws.md)}@}, can be used to {@{count the cardinality of the intersection of sets as well}@}. Let ${\overline {A_{k} } }$ represent {@{the complement of _A<sub>k</sub>_ with respect to some universal set _A_ such that $A_{k}\subseteq A$ for each _k_}@}. Then we have {@{$$\bigcap _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}={\overline {\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}{\overline {A_{i} } } } }$$}@} thereby {@{turning the problem of finding an intersection into the problem of finding a union}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-29,348,351!2028-06-25,1051,351!2028-08-18,1095,351!2028-01-25,918,330!2025-12-29,348,351-->

### graph coloring

The inclusion exclusion principle forms {@{the basis of algorithms for a number of NP-hard graph partitioning problems, such as graph coloring}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> <!--SR:!2027-03-06,660,320-->

A well known application of the principle is {@{the construction of the [chromatic polynomial](chromatic%20polynomial.md) of a graph}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-03,352,351-->

### bipartite graph perfect matchings

{@{The number of [perfect matchings](perfect%20matching.md) of a [bipartite graph](bipartite%20graph.md)}@} can be calculated using the principle.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> <!--SR:!2027-09-17,767,351-->

### number of onto functions

Given {@{finite sets _A_ and _B_}@}, how many {@{[surjective functions](surjective%20function.md) (onto functions) are there from _A_ to _B_}@}? [Without any loss of generality](without%20loss%20of%20generality.md) we may {@{take _A_ = {1, ..., _k_} and _B_ = {1, ..., _n_}<!-- flashcard separator -->}@}, since {@{only the cardinalities of the sets matter}@}. By using {@{_S_ as the set of all [functions](function%20(mathematics).md) from _A_ to _B_}@}, and defining, {@{for each _i_ in _B_, the property _P<sub>i</sub>_ as "the function misses the element _i_ in _B_" (_i_ is not in the [image](image%20(mathematics).md) of the function)}@}, the principle of inclusion–exclusion gives {@{the number of onto functions between _A_ and _B_}@} as:<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> {@{$$\sum _{j=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{j} }(-1)^{j}(n-j)^{k}.$$}@} (annotation: Direct enumeration is difficult because {@{each element of the co-domain may be mapped to by one or more elements in the domain}@}. {@{$(n - j)^k$}@} counts {@{the number of ways to assign $k$ inputs to $(n - j)$ outputs}@}.) <!--SR:!2029-11-11,1456,360!2025-12-21,340,351!2028-01-04,901,330!2029-11-17,1461,360!2026-12-11,588,310!2026-01-01,350,351!2030-02-12,1528,360!2027-08-05,713,320!2025-12-25,344,351!2026-01-03,352,351!2029-11-06,1452,360-->

### permutations with forbidden positions

{@{A [permutation](permutation.md) of the set _S_ = {1, ..., _n_} where each element of _S_ is restricted to not being in certain positions (here the permutation is considered as an ordering of the elements of _S_)}@} is {@{called a _permutation with forbidden positions_}@}. For example, with _S_ = {1,2,3,4}, the permutations with the restriction that the element 1 can not be in positions 1 or 3, and the element 2 can not be in position 4 are: 2134, 2143, 3124, 4123, 2341, 2431, 3241, 3421, 4231 and 4321. By letting {@{_A<sub>i</sub>_ be the set of positions that the element _i_ is not allowed to be in}@}, and the property _P_<sub>_i_</sub> to be {@{the property that a permutation puts element _i_ into a position in _A<sub>i</sub>_}@}, the principle of inclusion–exclusion can be used to {@{count the number of permutations which satisfy all the restrictions}@}.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-12-20,339,351!2029-11-24,1467,360!2026-01-05,354,351!2026-01-03,352,351!2029-12-06,1476,360-->

In the given example, there are {@{12 = 2(3!) permutations with property _P_<sub>1</sub>, 6 = 3! permutations with property _P_<sub>2</sub>}@} and no permutations have properties _P_<sub>3</sub> or _P_<sub>4</sub> as {@{there are no restrictions for these two elements}@}. The number of permutations satisfying the restrictions is thus: <p> {@{4! − (12 + 6 + 0 + 0) + (4) = 24 − 18 + 4 = 10}@}. <!--SR:!2029-10-31,1446,360!2028-01-30,853,331!2026-11-24,531,311-->

### Stirling numbers of the second kind

{@{The [Stirling numbers of the second kind](Stirling%20numbers%20of%20the%20second%20kind.md), _S_(_n_,_k_)}@} count {@{the number of [partitions](partition%20of%20a%20set.md) of a set of _n_ elements into _k_ non-empty subsets (indistinguishable _boxes_)}@}. {@{An explicit formula for them}@} can be obtained by applying {@{the principle of inclusion–exclusion to a very closely related problem}@}, namely, counting {@{the number of partitions of an _n_-set into _k_ non-empty but distinguishable boxes ([ordered](partially%20ordered%20set.md) non-empty subsets)}@}. Using the universal set {@{consisting of all partitions of the _n_-set into _k_ (possibly empty) distinguishable boxes, _A_<sub>1</sub>, _A_<sub>2</sub>, ..., _A<sub>k</sub>_}@}, and {@{the properties _P<sub>i</sub>_ meaning that the partition has box _A<sub>i</sub>_ empty}@}, the principle of inclusion–exclusion gives an answer for the related result.

The board _B_ is {@{any subset of the squares of a rectangular board with _n_ rows and _m_ columns}@}; we think of it as {@{the squares in which one is allowed to put a rook}@}. {@{The [coefficient](coefficient.md), _r<sub>k</sub>_(_B_) of _x<sup>k</sup>_}@} in the rook polynomial _R<sub>B</sub>_(_x_) is {@{the number of ways _k_ rooks, none of which attacks another, can be arranged in the squares of _B_}@}. For any board _B_, there is {@{a complementary board $B'$ consisting of the squares of the rectangular board that are not in _B_}@}.

It is sometimes convenient to be able to {@{calculate the highest coefficient of a rook polynomial in terms of the coefficients of the rook polynomial of the complementary board}@}.

## diluted inclusion–exclusion principle

In {@{many cases where the principle could give an exact formula}@} (in particular, {@{counting [prime numbers](prime%20number.md) using the [sieve of Eratosthenes](sieve%20of%20Eratosthenes.md)}@}), the formula arising {@{does not offer useful content because the number of terms in it is excessive}@}.

In [number theory](number%20theory.md), this difficulty was addressed by [Viggo Brun](Viggo%20Brun.md). After a slow start, {@{his ideas were taken up by others, and a large variety of [sieve methods](sieve%20theory.md)}@} developed.

The only important difference is that {@{the intersection term is multiplied by $p_{i_1} \cdots p_{i_j}$}@}. Clearly, the above inequality {@{holds when all $p_{i_k} = 1$}@}.

## proof of main statement

Choose {@{an element contained in the union of all sets}@} and let {@{$A_{1},A_{2},\dots ,A_{t}$ be the individual sets containing it}@}. (Note that {@{_t_ > 0}@}.) Since {@{the element is counted precisely once by the left-hand side of equation (__[1](#math_1)__)}@}, we need to show that {@{it is counted precisely once by the right-hand side}@}. On the right-hand side, {@{the only non-zero contributions occur}@} when {@{all the subsets in a particular term contain the chosen element}@}, that is, {@{all the subsets are selected from $A_{1},A_{2},\dots ,A_{t}$}@}. The contribution is {@{one for each of these sets (plus or minus depending on the term)}@} and therefore is {@{just the (signed) number of these subsets used in the term}@}. We then have: {@{$${\begin{aligned} & \phantom = |\{A_{i}\mid 1\leqslant i\leqslant t\}|-|\{A_{i}\cap A_{j}\mid 1\leqslant i<j\leqslant t\}|+\cdots +(-1)^{t+1}|\{A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap \cdots \cap A_{t}\}| \\ & ={\binom {t}{1} }-{\binom {t}{2} }+\cdots +(-1)^{t+1}{\binom {t}{t} }.\end{aligned} }$$}@} By {@{the [binomial theorem](binomial%20theorem.md)}@}, {@{$$0=(1-1)^{t}={\binom {t}{0} }-{\binom {t}{1} }+{\binom {t}{2} }-\cdots +(-1)^{t}{\binom {t}{t} }.$$}@} Using {@{the fact that ${\binom {t}{0} }=1$ and rearranging terms}@}, we have {@{$$1={\binom {t}{1} }-{\binom {t}{2} }+\cdots +(-1)^{t+1}{\binom {t}{t} },$$}@} and so, {@{the chosen element is counted only once by the right-hand side of equation (__[1](#math_1)__)}@}. <!--SR:!2029-11-05,1451,360!2030-03-10,1549,360!2030-02-25,1538,360!2026-01-02,351,351!2025-12-31,349,351!2029-11-08,1453,360!2026-11-04,562,310!2029-12-03,1474,360!2025-12-22,340,351!2029-11-20,1463,360!2029-11-10,1455,360!2026-01-05,354,351!2030-03-04,1544,360!2025-12-21,340,351!2028-03-28,972,340!2025-12-19,338,351-->
