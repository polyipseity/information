# Earth's circumference

## history

### Eratosthenes

The measure of Earth's circumference is the most famous among the results obtained by {@{[Eratosthenes](Eratosthenes.md) in 240 BC}@}, who estimated that the meridian has {@{a length of 252&nbsp;000 [stadia](stadion%20(unit).md), with an error on the real value (40&nbsp;007.863 km) between −2.4% and +0.8%}@} (assuming {@{a value for the stadion between 155 and 160 metres}@}; the exact value of the stadion remains a subject of debate to this day; see [stadion](stadion%20(unit).md)). <!--SR:!2026-01-24,381,290!2025-02-14,121,250!2026-01-20,374,290-->

Eratosthenes described his technique in {@{a book entitled _On the measure of the Earth_, which has not been preserved}@}; what has been preserved is {@{the simplified version described by [Cleomedes](Cleomedes.md) to popularise the discovery}@}. Cleomedes invites his reader to consider two Egyptian cities, {@{[Alexandria](Alexandria.md) and Syene (modern [Assuan](Aswan.md))}@}. Using {@{two poles perpendicular to the ground in the two cities respectively during the [summer solstice](summer%20solstice.md)}@}, the angle of {@{the [Sun](Sun.md)'s rays is measured to be about 7.2°}@}. <!--SR:!2026-11-19,654,330!2025-12-02,337,290!2025-04-04,194,310!2025-11-09,339,290!2026-08-18,584,330-->
