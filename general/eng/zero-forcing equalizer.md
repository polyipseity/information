# zero-forcing equalizer

{@{The __zero-forcing equalizer__}@} is {@{a form of linear [equalization](equalization%20(communications).md) [algorithm](algorithm.md) used in [communication systems](telecommunications.md)}@} which {@{applies the inverse of the [frequency response](frequency%20response.md) of the channel}@}. {@{This form of equalizer}@} was first proposed by {@{[Robert Lucky](Robert%20Lucky.md)}@}.

{@{The zero-forcing equalizer}@} applies {@{the inverse of the channel frequency response to the received signal}@}, to {@{restore the signal after the channel}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> It has {@{many useful applications}@}. For example, it is studied heavily for {@{[IEEE 802.11n](IEEE%20802.11n.md) \(MIMO\)}@} where {@{knowing the channel allows recovery of the two or more streams}@} which will be {@{received on top of each other on each antenna}@}. {@{The name _zero-forcing_}@} corresponds to {@{bringing down the [intersymbol interference](intersymbol%20interference.md) \(ISI\) to zero}@} in {@{a noise-free case}@}. {@{This will be useful}@} when {@{ISI is significant compared to noise}@}.

For {@{a channel with [frequency response](frequency%20response.md) $F(f)$}@} {@{the zero-forcing equalizer $C(f)$}@} is constructed by {@{$C(f)=1/F(f)$}@}. Thus {@{the combination of channel and equalizer}@} gives {@{a flat frequency response and linear phase $F(f)C(f)=1$}@}.

In {@{reality}@}, {@{zero-forcing equalization}@} {@{does not work in most applications}@}, for {@{the following reasons}@}:

1. Even though {@{the channel impulse response has finite length}@}, {@{the impulse response of the equalizer}@} needs to {@{be infinitely long}@} \(annotation: {@{The inverse of an casual FIR filter}@} is {@{an IRR filter}@}.\)
2. At {@{some frequencies}@} {@{the received signal may be weak}@}. To {@{compensate}@}, {@{the magnitude of the zero-forcing filter \("gain"\)}@} {@{grows very large}@}. As a consequence, {@{any noise added after the channel}@} gets {@{boosted by a large factor}@} and destroys {@{the overall signal-to-noise ratio}@}. Furthermore, the channel may have {@{zeros in its frequency response}@} that {@{cannot be inverted at all}@}. \({@{Gain \* 0}@} still {@{equals 0}@}\).

{@{This second item \(annotation: noise amplification and zeros\)}@} is {@{often the more limiting condition}@}. {@{These problems are addressed}@} in {@{the linear [MMSE](minimum%20mean-square%20error.md) equalizer}@}<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> by {@{making a small modification to the denominator of $C(f)$}@}: {@{$C(f)=1/(F(f)+k)$}@}, where k is {@{related to the channel response and the signal [SNR](signal-to-noise%20ratio.md)}@}.

## algorithm

If {@{the channel response \(or [channel transfer function](transfer%20function.md)\) for a particular channel}@} is {@{H\(s\)}@} then {@{the input signal}@} is {@{multiplied by the [reciprocal](multiplicative%20inverse.md) of it}@}. This is intended to {@{remove the effect of channel from the received signal}@}, in particular {@{the [intersymbol interference](intersymbol%20interference.md) \(ISI\)}@}.

{@{The zero-forcing equalizer}@} {@{removes all ISI}@}, and is {@{ideal when the channel is noiseless}@}. However, when {@{the channel is noisy}@}, the zero-forcing equalizer will {@{amplify the noise greatly at frequencies _f_}@} where {@{the channel response H\(j2Ï€<!-- markdown separator -->_f_\) has a small magnitude}@} \(i.e. {@{near zeroes of the channel}@}\) in the attempt to {@{invert the channel completely}@}. {@{A more balanced linear equalizer}@} in this case is {@{the __[minimum mean-square error](minimum%20mean-square%20error.md) equalizer__}@}, which {@{does not usually eliminate ISI completely}@} but instead {@{minimizes the total power of the noise and ISI components in the output}@}.
