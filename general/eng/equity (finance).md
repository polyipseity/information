# equity

In finance, __equity__ is {@{an ownership interest in [property](property.md) that may be offset by [debts](debt.md) or other [liabilities](liability%20(financial%20accounting).md)}@}. Equity is measured {@{for [accounting](accounting.md) purposes by subtracting liabilities from the value of the [assets](asset.md) owned}@}. For example, if {@{someone owns a car worth $24&nbsp;000 and owes $10&nbsp;000 on the loan used to buy the car}@}, {@{the difference of $14&nbsp;000}@} is equity. Equity can apply to {@{a single asset, such as a car or house, or to an entire business}@}. A business that {@{needs to start up or expand its operations}@} can {@{sell its equity in order to raise cash that does not have to be repaid on a set schedule}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2027-04-11,713,330!2027-02-17,674,330!2025-10-09,296,330!2025-07-02,201,310!2027-09-27,845,330!2025-08-06,246,330!2027-12-13,897,330-->

When {@{liabilities attached to an asset exceed its value}@}, the difference is called {@{a deficit and the asset is informally said to be "underwater" or "upside-down"}@}. In {@{government finance or other non-profit settings}@}, equity is known as {@{"net position" or "net assets"}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-10,249,330!2027-11-17,878,330!2025-07-13,225,330!2025-09-01,267,330-->
