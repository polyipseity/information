# neutrino detector

A __neutrino detector__ is {@{a physics apparatus which is designed to study [neutrinos](neutrino.md)}@}. Because neutrinos only [weakly interact](weak%20interaction.md) with other particles of matter, {@{neutrino detectors must be very large to detect a significant number of neutrinos}@}. Neutrino detectors are often built {@{underground, to isolate the detector from [cosmic rays](cosmic%20ray.md) and other background radiation}@}.
