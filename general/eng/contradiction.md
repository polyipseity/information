# contradiction

In [traditional logic](term%20logic.md), a __contradiction__ occurs when {@{a [proposition](proposition.md) conflicts either with itself or established [fact](fact.md)}@}. It is often used as a tool to {@{detect [disingenuous](deception.md) beliefs and [bias](bias.md)}@}. Illustrating a general tendency in applied logic, {@{[Aristotle](aristotle.md)'s [law of noncontradiction](law%20of%20noncontradiction.md)}@} states that {@{"It is impossible that the same thing can at the same time both belong and not belong to the same object and in the same respect."}@} <!--SR:!2028-06-13,986,330!2027-06-23,762,330!2028-11-29,1200,350!2027-07-11,784,330-->

In {@{modern [formal logic](logic.md#formal%20logic) and [type theory](type%20theory.md)}@}, the term is {@{mainly used instead for a _single_ proposition, often denoted by the [falsum](up%20tack.md) symbol [$\bot$](bottom%20type.md)}@}; a proposition is a contradiction if {@{[false](false%20(logic).md) can be derived from it, using the rules of the logic}@}. It is a proposition that is {@{unconditionally false (i.e., a self-contradictory proposition)}@}. This can be generalized to {@{a collection of propositions, which is then said to "contain" a contradiction}@}. <!--SR:!2026-05-09,451,310!2029-03-26,1289,350!2027-01-04,641,330!2027-04-14,723,330!2028-07-11,1089,350-->
