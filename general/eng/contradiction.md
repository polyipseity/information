# contradiction

In [traditional logic](term%20logic.md), a __contradiction__ occurs when {@{a [proposition](proposition.md) conflicts either with itself or established [fact](fact.md)}@}. It is often used as a tool to {@{detect [disingenuous](deception.md) beliefs and [bias](bias.md)}@}. Illustrating a general tendency in applied logic, {@{[Aristotle](aristotle.md)'s [law of noncontradiction](law%20of%20noncontradiction.md)}@} states that {@{"It is impossible that the same thing can at the same time both belong and not belong to the same object and in the same respect."}@} <!--SR:!2025-10-01,297,330!2025-05-21,178,310!2025-08-17,263,330!2025-05-17,183,310-->

In {@{modern [formal logic](logic.md#formal%20logic) and [type theory](type%20theory.md)}@}, the term is {@{mainly used instead for a _single_ proposition, often denoted by the [falsum](up%20tack.md) symbol [$\bot$](bottom%20type.md)}@}; a proposition is a contradiction if {@{[false](false%20(logic).md) can be derived from it, using the rules of the logic}@}. It is a proposition that is {@{unconditionally false (i.e., a self-contradictory proposition)}@}. This can be generalized to {@{a collection of propositions, which is then said to "contain" a contradiction}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-12,112,290!2025-09-14,283,330!2025-04-03,150,310!2025-04-21,169,310!2025-07-18,239,330-->
