# calorimeter

```Python
# pytextgen generate module
# import ../../../tools/utility.py.md
```

A __calorimeter__ is {@{an object used for [calorimetry](calorimetry.md)}@}. It can be used to {@{measure the [heat](heat.md) of [physical changes](physical%20change.md) or [chemical reactions](chemical%20reaction.md)}@}.

A simple calorimeter consists of {@{a [thermometer](thermometer.md) attached to a [metal](metal.md) container filled with [water](water.md) above a [combustion](combustion.md) chamber}@}. For more accurate measurements, {@{a bomb calorimeter can be used}@}.

## errors

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects('aa02', '2845'),
  (
    'conditions are not standard conditions',
    'heat capacities of equipment are not accounted for',
    'heat loss to the surroundings',
    'reaction is incomplete',
  ),
)
```

[Measurement errors](observational%20error.md) may be caused by:
