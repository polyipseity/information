# equalization

In {@{[telecommunication](telecommunication.md)}@}, {@{__equalization__}@} is {@{the reversal of distortion incurred by a signal transmitted through a [channel](channel%20(communications).md)}@}. {@{__Equalizers__}@} are used to {@{render the [frequency response](frequency%20response.md)—for instance of a telephone line}@}—<!-- markdown separator -->{@{_flat_ from end-to-end}@}. When {@{a [channel](communication%20channel.md) has been equalized}@} {@{the [frequency domain](frequency%20domain.md) attributes of the signal at the input}@} are {@{faithfully reproduced at the output}@}. {@{Telephones, [DSL](DSL.md) lines and television cables}@} use {@{equalizers to prepare data signals for transmission}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-20,15,290!2025-09-20,15,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-20,15,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-21,16,290-->

Equalizers are {@{critical to the successful operation of electronic systems}@} such as {@{[analog broadcast television](analog%20television.md)}@}. In this application {@{the actual [waveform](waveform.md) of the transmitted signal}@} must {@{be preserved, not just its frequency content}@}. {@{Equalizing filters}@} must {@{cancel out any [group delay and phase delay](group%20delay%20and%20phase%20delay.md) between different frequency components}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-20,15,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-19,14,290-->

## analog telecommunications

### audio lines

{@{Early telephone systems}@} used {@{equalization}@} to {@{correct for the reduced level of high frequencies in long cables}@}, typically using {@{[Zobel networks](Zobel%20network.md)}@}. {@{These kinds of equalizers}@} can also be used to {@{produce a circuit with a wider bandwidth}@} than {@{the standard telephone band of 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz}@}. This was {@{particularly useful for broadcasters}@} who needed {@{"music" quality, not "telephone" quality on landlines carrying program material}@}. It is necessary to {@{remove or cancel any [loading coils](loading%20coil.md) in the line}@} before {@{equalization can be successful}@}. Equalization was also applied to {@{correct the response of the transducers}@}, for example, {@{a particular [microphone](microphone.md)}@} might be {@{more sensitive to low [frequency](frequency.md) sounds than to high frequency sounds}@}, so {@{an equalizer would be used}@} to {@{increase the volume of the higher frequencies \(_boost_\)}@}, and {@{reduce the volume of the low frequency sounds \(_cut_\)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-20,15,290-->

### television lines

{@{A similar approach to audio}@} was taken with {@{television landlines with two important additional complications}@}. {@{The first of these}@} is that {@{the television signal}@} is {@{a wide bandwidth covering many more octaves than an audio signal}@}. {@{A television equalizer}@} consequently {@{typically requires more filter sections than an audio equalizer}@}. To {@{keep this manageable}@}, {@{television equalizer sections}@} were often {@{combined into a single network using [ladder topology](ladder%20topology.md#ladder%20topologies)}@} to form {@{a [Cauer equalizer](Cauer%20equaliser.md#Cauer%20equaliser)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-20,15,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-20,15,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-20,15,290-->

{@{The second issue}@} is that {@{phase equalization is essential}@} for {@{an analog television signal}@}. {@{Without it [dispersion](material%20dispersion.md)}@} causes {@{the loss of integrity of the original wave-shape}@} and is seen as {@{smearing of what were originally sharp edges in the picture}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-20,15,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-10-22,37,290-->

## digital telecommunications

{@{Modern digital telephone systems}@} have {@{less trouble in the voice frequency range}@} as {@{only the local line to the subscriber}@} now {@{remains in analog format}@}, but {@{[DSL](digital%20subscriber%20line.md) circuits}@} operating {@{in the [MHz](megahertz.md) range on those same wires}@} may suffer {@{severe [attenuation distortion](attenuation%20distortion.md)}@}, which is dealt with by {@{automatic equalization or by abandoning the worst frequencies}@}. {@{[Picturephone](videophone.md) circuits}@} also {@{had equalizers}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-20,15,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-19,14,290!2025-09-20,15,290!2025-09-20,15,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-21,16,290-->

In {@{[digital communications](digital%20communications.md)}@}, {@{the equalizer's purpose}@} is to {@{reduce [intersymbol interference](intersymbol%20interference.md)}@} to allow {@{recovery of the transmit symbols}@}. It may be {@{a simple [linear filter](linear%20filter.md) or a complex algorithm}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-21,16,290!2025-09-20,15,290!2025-09-20,15,290-->
