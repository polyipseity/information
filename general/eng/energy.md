# energy

In [physics](physics.md), __energy__ (from {@{[Ancient Greek](Ancient%20Greek.md) ἐνέργεια (_enérgeia_) 'activity'}@}) is {@{the [quantitative property](physical%20property.md) that is transferred to a [body](physical%20object.md) or to a [physical system](physical%20system.md), recognizable in the performance of [work](work%20(physics).md) and in the form of [heat](heat.md) and [light](light.md)}@}. Energy is {@{a [conserved quantity](conservation%20law.md)—the law of [conservation of energy](conservation%20of%20energy.md) states that energy can be [converted](energy%20transformation.md) in form, but not created or destroyed}@}; [matter](matter.md) and energy {@{may also be converted to one another}@}. The unit of [measurement](measurement.md) for energy in {@{the [International System of Units](International%20System%20of%20Units.md) (SI) is the [joule](joule.md) (J)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-29,192,310!2025-03-04,163,310!2025-06-08,234,310!2025-05-04,222,330!2025-03-14,180,310-->
