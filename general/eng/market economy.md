# market economy

A __market economy__ is {@{an [economic system](economic%20system.md) in which the decisions regarding [investment](fixed%20investment.md), [production](production%20(economics).md), and [distribution](distribution%20(economics).md) to the consumers are guided by the [price signals](price%20signal.md) created by the forces of [supply and demand](supply%20and%20demand.md)}@}. The major characteristic of a market economy is {@{the existence of [factor markets](factor%20market.md) that play a dominant role in the allocation of [capital](capital%20(economics).md)}@} and {@{the [factors of production](factors%20of%20production.md)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-04-20,150,310!2025-03-22,132,310!2025-10-14,296,330-->

Market economies range from {@{minimally regulated [free-market](free%20market.md) and _[laissez-faire](laissez-faire.md)_ systems}@} where {@{state activity is restricted to providing [public goods](public%20good%20(economics).md) and [services](public%20service.md) and safeguarding private ownership}@},<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> to {@{[interventionist](market%20intervention.md) forms}@} where {@{the government plays an active role in correcting [market failures](market%20failure.md) and promoting [social welfare](welfare%20spending.md)}@}. {@{State-directed or [dirigist](dirigisme.md) economies}@} are those where {@{the state plays a directive role in guiding the overall development of the market through [industrial policies](industrial%20policy.md) or [indicative planning](indicative%20planning.md)}@}—which {@{guides yet does not substitute the market for [economic planning](economic%20planning.md)}@}—a form sometimes referred to as {@{a [mixed economy](mixed%20economy.md)}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup><sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-07-30,233,330!2025-05-07,164,310!2025-07-01,196,310!2025-10-13,295,330!2025-03-03,104,290!2025-11-08,316,330!2025-07-23,213,310!2025-09-17,274,330-->

Market economies are contrasted with {@{[planned economies](planned%20economy.md) where investment and production decisions are embodied in an integrated economy-wide economic plan}@}. In {@{a [centrally planned economy](planned%20economy.md#central%20planning)}@}, economic planning is {@{the principal allocation mechanism between firms rather than markets}@}, with {@{the economy's [means of production](means%20of%20production.md)}@} being {@{owned and operated by a single organizational body}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-23,85,290!2025-09-16,273,330!2025-02-16,104,290!2025-09-03,263,330!2025-07-31,234,330-->

## characteristics

### property rights

For {@{market economies to function efficiently}@}, governments must {@{establish clearly defined and enforceable [property rights](right%20to%20property.md) for assets and capital goods}@}. However, property rights do not {@{specifically mean private property rights}@} and market economies do not {@{logically presuppose the existence of [private ownership](private%20property.md) of the [means of production](means%20of%20production.md)}@}. Market economies {@{can and often do include various types of [cooperatives](cooperative.md) or autonomous [state-owned enterprises](state-owned%20enterprise.md)}@} that {@{acquire [capital goods](capital%20(economics).md) and raw materials in [capital markets](capital%20market.md)}@}. These enterprises utilize {@{a market-determined free price system to allocate capital goods and labor}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> In addition, there are {@{many variations of [market socialism](market%20socialism.md)}@} where {@{the majority of capital assets are socially owned with markets allocating resources between socially owned firms}@}. These models range from {@{systems based on [employee-owned enterprises](worker%20cooperative.md) based on [self-management](workers'%20self-management.md)}@} to {@{a combination of public ownership of the [means of production](means%20of%20production.md) with [factor markets](factor%20market.md)}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-06,314,330!2025-05-04,161,310!2025-05-21,179,310!2025-08-28,257,330!2025-04-23,140,290!2025-08-08,224,310!2025-08-03,237,330!2025-10-16,298,330!2025-01-21,82,270!2025-06-21,189,310!2025-07-24,214,310-->

### supply and demand

{@{Supply and demand}@} supposedly {@{work in tandem}@}. The economic theory is that {@{supply slopes upwards as people buy more and demand drops as prices rise and people buy less}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-08-02,236,330!2025-04-09,147,310!2025-10-17,299,330-->

Market economies rely upon {@{a price system to signal market actors to adjust production and investment}@}. Price formation relies on {@{the interaction of supply and demand to reach or approximate an equilibrium}@} where {@{the unit price for a particular good or service is at a point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-05,313,330!2025-09-02,262,330!2025-10-15,297,330-->

{@{The price data point where the supply and demand lines intersect}@} is called {@{the [market-clearing price](market%20clearing.md)}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-08-04,238,330!2025-11-04,312,330-->

Governments can {@{intervene by establishing [price ceilings](price%20ceiling.md) or price floors in specific markets (such as [minimum wage](minimum%20wage.md) laws in the labor market)}@}, or {@{use [fiscal policy](fiscal%20policy.md) to discourage certain consumer behavior or to address market externalities generated by certain transactions ([Pigovian taxes](pigouvian%20tax.md))}@}. Different perspectives exist on {@{the role of government in both regulating and guiding market economies and in addressing social inequalities produced by markets}@}. Fundamentally, a market economy requires that {@{a price system affected by supply and demand exists as the primary mechanism for allocating resources irrespective of the level of regulation}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-22,190,310!2025-01-31,82,270!2025-02-25,109,290!2025-04-22,139,290-->
