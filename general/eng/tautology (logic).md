# tautology

- This article is about tautology in formal logic. For other uses, see [tautology (disambiguation)](tautology.md).

In [mathematical logic](mathematical%20logic.md), a __tautology__ (from [Ancient Greek](Ancient%20Greek.md): ταυτολογία) is {@{a [formula](well-formed%20formula.md) or [assertion](judgment%20(mathematical%20logic).md) that is true for every possible assignment of [values](truth%20value.md) to its [variables](propositional%20variable.md)}@}. An example is "x=y or x≠y". Similarly, "either the ball is green, or the ball is not green" is {@{always true, regardless of the colour of the ball}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,126,290!2025-03-07,133,310-->

{@{The philosopher [Ludwig Wittgenstein](Ludwig%20Wittgenstein.md)}@} first applied the term to {@{redundancies of [propositional logic](propositional%20calculus.md) in 1921, borrowing from [rhetoric](rhetoric.md), where a [tautology](tautology%20(language).md) is a repetitive statement}@}. In logic, a formula is {@{[satisfiable](satisfiability.md) if it is true under at least one interpretation}@}, and thus a tautology is {@{a formula whose negation is unsatisfiable. In other words, it cannot be false}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-10,135,310!2025-03-12,135,290!2025-12-15,339,310!2025-10-21,312,330-->

{@{Unsatisfiable statements, both through negation and affirmation}@}, are known formally as {@{[contradictions](contradiction.md)}@}. {@{A formula that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction}@} is {@{said to be [logically contingent](contingency%20(philosophy).md)}@}. Such a formula can be made {@{either true or false based on the values assigned to its propositional variables}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-10,332,290!2025-07-23,242,330!2025-07-22,242,330!2025-07-29,247,330!2025-05-04,176,310-->

{@{The [double turnstile](double%20turnstile.md) notation $\vDash S$}@} is used to indicate that _S_ is a tautology. Tautology is sometimes symbolized by {@{"V<!-- markdown separator -->_pq_", and contradiction by "O<!-- markdown separator -->_pq_"}@}. {@{The [tee](tee%20(symbol).md) symbol $\top$}@} is sometimes used to {@{denote an arbitrary tautology}@}, with {@{the dual symbol $\bot$ ([falsum](up%20tack.md)) representing an arbitrary contradiction}@}; in any symbolism, a tautology may be {@{substituted for the truth value "[true](logical%20truth.md)", as symbolized, for instance, by "1"}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-22,168,310!2026-09-04,552,330!2025-08-22,265,330!2025-04-20,166,310!2025-08-16,259,330!2025-09-03,275,330-->

Tautologies are a key concept in {@{[propositional logic](propositional%20calculus.md)}@}, where a tautology is {@{defined as a propositional formula that is true under any possible [Boolean valuation](interpretation%20(logic).md#interpretations%20for%20propositional%20logic) of its [propositional variables](propositional%20variable.md)}@}. A key property of tautologies in propositional logic is that {@{an [effective method](effective%20method.md) exists for testing whether a given formula is always satisfied (equiv., whether its negation is unsatisfiable)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-08-27,269,330!2025-03-26,148,310!2025-05-18,177,310-->

The definition of tautology can be extended to {@{sentences in [predicate logic](first-order%20logic.md)}@}, which may {@{contain [quantifiers](quantifier%20(logic).md)—a feature absent from sentences of propositional logic}@}. Indeed, in propositional logic, there is {@{no distinction between a tautology and a [logically valid](validity%20(logic).md) formula}@}. In the context of predicate logic, many authors define a tautology to be {@{a sentence that can be obtained by taking a tautology of propositional logic, and uniformly replacing each propositional variable by a first-order formula (one formula per propositional variable)}@}. The set of such formulas is {@{a [proper subset](subset.md) of the set of logically valid sentences of predicate logic (i.e., sentences that are true in every [model](structure%20(mathematical%20logic).md))}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-17,161,310!2025-04-29,172,310!2025-07-27,226,310!2025-05-16,150,250!2025-03-28,129,270-->
