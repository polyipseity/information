# Doppler effect

## general

> - {@{$f_r$}@} is {@{the received [frequency](frequency.md)}@}, $f_s$ is {@{the source [frequency](frequency.md)}@}, and $c$ is {@{the [phase velocity](phase%20velocity.md) of the [wave](wave.md) in the [medium](transmission%20medium.md)}@}
> - {@{$v_r$}@} is {@{the [speed](speed.md) of the receiver relative to the [medium](transmission%20medium.md)}@}, {@{negative when moving towards the source and positive when moving away from the source}@}; $v_s$ is {@{the [speed](speed.md) of the source relative to the [medium](transmission%20medium.md)}@}, {@{positive when moving away from the receiver and negative when moving towards the receiver}@}; for memorization: {@{positive when moving away, negative moving towards}@}

>   - {@{the speeds}@} are {@{negligible compared to the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md) in [vacuum](vacuum.md)}@}, otherwise {@{only the [relativistic Doppler effect](relativistic%20Doppler%20effect.md) is accurate for this situation}@} <!--SR:!2026-05-15,566,270!2026-06-08,622,310!2026-03-01,453,230!2027-02-18,832,330-->
