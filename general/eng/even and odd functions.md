# even and odd functions

- Not to be confused with {@{[even and odd numbers](parity%20(mathematics).md)}@}.

In [mathematics](mathematics.md), {@{an __even function__}@} is {@{a [real function](function%20of%20a%20real%20variable.md) such that $f(-x) = f(x)$ for every $x$ in its [domain](domain%20of%20a%20function.md)}@}. Similarly, {@{an __odd function__}@} is {@{a function such that $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for every $x$ in its domain}@}.

They are named for {@{the [parity](parity%20(mathematics).md) of the powers of the [power functions](exponentiation.md#power%20functions)}@} which satisfy each condition: {@{the function $f(x) = x^n$ is even if _n_ is an [even integer](parity%20(mathematics).md), and it is odd if _n_ is an odd integer}@}.

Even functions are those real functions whose [graph](graph%20of%20a%20function.md) is {@{[self-symmetric](symmetry%20(geometry).md) with respect to the y-axis, and odd functions are those whose graph is self-symmetric with respect to the [origin](origin%20(mathematics).md)}@}.

If {@{the domain of a real function is self-symmetric with respect to the origin}@}, then the function can be {@{uniquely decomposed as the sum of an even function and an odd function}@}.
