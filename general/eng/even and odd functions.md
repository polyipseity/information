# even and odd functions

- Not to be confused with {@{[even and odd numbers](parity%20(mathematics).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-09-19,314,330-->

In [mathematics](mathematics.md), {@{an __even function__}@} is {@{a [real function](function%20of%20a%20real%20variable.md) such that $f(-x) = f(x)$ for every $x$ in its [domain](domain%20of%20a%20function.md)}@}. Similarly, {@{an __odd function__}@} is {@{a function such that $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for every $x$ in its domain}@}. <!--SR:!2028-05-13,1065,350!2028-05-24,1076,350!2029-01-20,1265,350!2028-02-02,987,350-->

They are named for {@{the [parity](parity%20(mathematics).md) of the powers of the [power functions](exponentiation.md#power%20functions)}@} which satisfy each condition: {@{the function $f(x) = x^n$ is even if _n_ is an [even integer](parity%20(mathematics).md), and it is odd if _n_ is an odd integer}@}. <!--SR:!2028-10-08,1183,350!2025-09-18,314,330-->

Even functions are those real functions whose [graph](graph%20of%20a%20function.md) is {@{[self-symmetric](symmetry%20(geometry).md) with respect to the y-axis, and odd functions are those whose graph is self-symmetric with respect to the [origin](origin%20(mathematics).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-08-27,525,310-->

If {@{the domain of a real function is self-symmetric with respect to the origin}@}, then the function can be {@{uniquely decomposed as the sum of an even function and an odd function}@}. <!--SR:!2026-12-03,649,330!2028-06-09,1087,350-->
