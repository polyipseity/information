### two port network transfer function

{@{Transfer functions, in general, in control theory}@} are {@{given the symbol H\(s\)}@}.

Sometimes the analyst is {@{only interested in the magnitude of the gain and not the phase angle}@}. In this case {@{the complex numbers can be eliminated from the transfer function}@} and it might then be written as; {@{$$A(\omega )=\left|{\frac {V_{o} }{V_{i} } }\right|$$}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-26,267,330!2026-03-03,271,330!2025-06-11,67,310!2026-01-27,242,330!2026-02-10,255,330!2025-06-14,70,329-->

#### two port parameters

- Main article: ::@:: [Two-port network](two-port%20network.md) <!--SR:!2025-06-13,69,329!2025-06-25,79,340-->

{@{The concept of a two-port network}@} can be {@{useful in network analysis as a [black box](black%20box.md) approach to analysis}@}. {@{The behaviour of the two-port network in a larger network}@} can be {@{entirely characterised without necessarily stating anything about the internal structure}@}. However, to do this it is necessary to {@{have more information than just the A\(jω\) described above}@}. It can be shown that {@{four such parameters are required to fully characterise the two-port network}@}. These could be {@{the forward transfer function, the input impedance, the reverse transfer function \(i.e., the voltage appearing at the input when a voltage is applied to the output\) and the output impedance}@}. There are {@{many others \(see the main article for a full listing\)}@}, one of these {@{expresses all four parameters as impedances}@}. It is usual to {@{express the four parameters as a matrix}@}; {@{$${\begin{bmatrix}V_{1}\\V_{0}\end{bmatrix} }={\begin{bmatrix}z(j\omega )_{11}&z(j\omega )_{12}\\z(j\omega )_{21}&z(j\omega )_{22}\end{bmatrix} }{\begin{bmatrix}I_{1}\\I_{0}\end{bmatrix} }$$}@} The matrix may be {@{abbreviated to a representative element}@}; {@{$\left[z(j\omega )\right]$ or just $\left[z\right]$}@} <!--SR:!2026-02-01,247,330!2025-06-23,77,340!2025-06-21,75,329!2025-06-26,80,340!2026-02-06,251,330!2025-06-17,71,329!2025-11-03,172,310!2025-06-15,71,329!2025-06-22,76,329!2025-06-14,70,329!2025-10-12,150,309!2025-06-22,76,329!2025-06-21,75,329-->

These concepts are {@{capable of being extended to networks of more than two ports}@}. However, this is {@{rarely done in reality}@} because, {@{in many practical cases, ports are considered either purely input or purely output}@}. If {@{reverse direction transfer functions are ignored}@}, {@{a multi-port network can always be decomposed into a number of two-port networks}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-21,75,329!2025-06-15,71,329!2025-06-15,71,329!2025-06-09,66,329!2025-06-18,72,329-->

#### distributed components

Where {@{a network is composed of discrete components}@}, {@{analysis using two-port networks}@} is {@{a matter of choice, not essential}@}. The network can always {@{alternatively be analysed in terms of its individual component transfer functions}@}. However, if {@{a network contains [distributed components](distributed-element%20model.md)}@}, such as {@{in the case of a [transmission line](transmission%20line.md)}@}, then it is {@{not possible to analyse in terms of individual components since they do not exist}@}. {@{The most common approach}@} to this is to {@{model the line as a two-port network and characterise it using two-port parameters \(or something equivalent to them\)}@}.

There are {@{many other ways that non-linearity can appear in a network}@}. {@{All methods utilising linear superposition}@} will {@{fail when non-linear components are present}@}. There are {@{several options for dealing with non-linearity}@} depending on {@{the type of circuit and the information the analyst wishes to obtain}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-29,83,340!2025-06-24,78,340!2025-06-18,72,329!2026-01-29,244,330!2026-01-27,242,330-->

### existence, uniqueness and stability

{@{An important consideration in non-linear analysis}@} is {@{the question of uniqueness}@}. For {@{a network composed of linear components}@} there will {@{always be one, and only one, unique solution for a given set of boundary conditions}@}. This is {@{not always the case in non-linear circuits}@}. For instance, {@{a linear resistor with a fixed current applied to it}@} has {@{only one solution for the voltage across it}@}. On the other hand, {@{the non-linear [tunnel diode](tunnel%20diode.md)}@} has {@{up to three solutions for the voltage for a given current}@}. That is, {@{a particular solution for the current through the diode is not unique}@}, there may be {@{others, equally valid}@}. In some cases there may {@{not be a solution at all: the question of existence of solutions must be considered}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-22,76,329!2025-06-26,80,340!2026-01-31,246,330!2025-06-18,72,329!2025-06-24,78,340!2025-06-26,80,340!2025-06-25,79,340!2026-01-18,236,330!2025-06-14,70,329!2026-02-27,268,330!2025-06-16,70,329!2025-06-26,80,340-->

Another important consideration is {@{the question of stability}@}. {@{A particular solution may exist}@}, but {@{it may not be stable, rapidly departing from that point at the slightest stimulation}@}. It can be shown that {@{a network that is absolutely stable for all conditions}@} must {@{have one, and only one, solution for each set of conditions}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-06-21,75,329!2026-02-21,263,330!2025-06-20,74,329!2025-06-12,68,329!2025-06-24,78,340-->

### methods

#### boolean analysis of switching networks

{@{A switching device}@} is {@{one where the non-linearity is utilised to produce two opposite states}@}. {@{CMOS devices in digital circuits}@}, for instance, have {@{their output connected to either the positive or the negative supply rail}@} and are {@{never found at anything in between except during a transient period when the device is switching}@}. Here {@{the non-linearity is designed to be extreme}@}, and {@{the analyst can take advantage of that fact}@}. These kinds of networks can be {@{analysed using [Boolean algebra](Boolean%20algebra%20(logic).md)}@} by {@{assigning the two states \("on"/"off", "positive"/"negative" or whatever states are being used\) to the Boolean constants "0" and "1"}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-22,76,329!2025-06-24,78,340!2025-06-21,75,329!2026-02-20,262,330!2025-06-25,79,340!2025-06-18,72,329!2025-06-06,63,310!2025-06-17,71,329!2025-06-10,67,329-->

{@{The transients are ignored in this analysis}@}, along with {@{any slight discrepancy between the state of the device and the nominal state assigned to a Boolean value}@}. For instance, {@{Boolean "1" may be assigned to the state of +5V}@}. The output of the device {@{may be +4.5V but the analyst still considers this to be Boolean "1"}@}. Device manufacturers will usually {@{specify a range of values in their data sheets that are to be considered undefined \(i.e. the result will be unpredictable\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-23,238,330!2025-11-02,171,310!2025-06-25,79,340!2026-02-02,247,330!2025-06-23,77,340-->

The transients are {@{not entirely uninteresting to the analyst}@}. {@{The maximum rate of switching}@} is determined by {@{the speed of transition from one state to the other}@}. Happily for the analyst, for {@{many devices most of the transition occurs in the linear portion of the devices transfer function}@} and {@{linear analysis can be applied to obtain at least an approximate answer}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-26,80,340!2025-06-18,72,329!2025-06-22,76,329!2025-06-09,66,329!2025-06-20,74,329-->

It is mathematically possible to {@{derive [Boolean algebras](Boolean%20algebra%20(structure).md) that have more than two states}@}. There is {@{not too much use found for these in electronics}@}, although {@{three-state devices are passingly common}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-17,71,329!2025-06-28,82,340!2025-06-22,76,329-->

#### separation of bias and signal analyses

This technique is used where {@{the operation of the circuit is to be essentially linear}@}, but {@{the devices used to implement it are non-linear}@}. {@{A transistor amplifier}@} is {@{an example of this kind of network}@}. {@{The essence of this technique}@} is to {@{separate the analysis into two parts}@}. Firstly, {@{the dc [biases](biasing%20(electronics).md) are analysed using some non-linear method}@}. This {@{establishes the [quiescent](biasing.md) operating point of the circuit}@}. Secondly, {@{the [small signal](small%20signal.md) characteristics of the circuit are analysed using linear network analysis}@}. Examples of methods that {@{can be used for both these stages are given below}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-28,243,330!2025-06-23,77,340!2025-06-19,73,329!2025-06-25,79,340!2025-06-09,66,329!2025-06-24,78,340!2025-06-19,73,329!2025-06-22,76,329!2025-06-20,74,329!2025-06-19,73,329-->

#### graphical method of dc analysis

In {@{a great many circuit designs}@}, {@{the dc bias}@} is {@{fed to a non-linear component via a resistor \(or possibly a network of resistors\)}@}. Since {@{resistors are linear components}@}, it is {@{particularly easy to determine the quiescent operating point of the non-linear device from a graph of its transfer function}@}. The method is as follows: from {@{linear network analysis}@} {@{the output transfer function \(that is output voltage against output current\) is calculated for the network of resistor\(s\) and the generator driving them}@}. This will be {@{a straight line \(called the [load line](load%20line%20(electronics).md)\)}@} and can {@{readily be superimposed on the transfer function plot of the non-linear device}@}. {@{The point where the lines cross}@} is {@{the quiescent operating point}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-08,253,330!2025-06-12,68,329!2026-02-05,251,330!2025-06-20,74,329!2025-12-15,205,329!2026-01-23,238,330!2025-10-29,167,320!2026-02-08,253,330!2025-06-25,79,340!2026-02-03,248,330!2026-02-01,247,330-->

Perhaps the easiest practical method is to {@{calculate the \(linear\) network open circuit voltage and short circuit current}@} and {@{plot these on the transfer function of the non-linear device}@}. {@{The straight line joining these two point}@} is {@{the transfer function of the network}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-28,166,320!2025-10-23,161,320!2025-11-05,174,310!2025-06-21,75,329-->

In reality, the designer of the circuit would {@{proceed in the reverse direction to that described}@}. Starting from {@{a plot provided in the manufacturers data sheet for the non-linear device}@}, the designer would {@{choose the desired operating point and then calculate the linear component values required to achieve it}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,81,340!2025-06-22,76,329!2026-02-16,259,330-->

It is {@{still possible to use this method}@} if {@{the device being biased has its bias fed through another device which is itself non-linear, a diode for instance}@}. In this case however, {@{the plot of the network transfer function onto the device being biased}@} would {@{no longer be a straight line and is consequently more tedious to do}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-29,83,340!2025-06-20,74,329!2025-06-14,70,329!2026-01-30,245,330-->

#### small signal equivalent circuit

- Main article: ::@:: [Small-signal model](small-signal%20model.md) <!--SR:!2025-06-29,83,340!2025-06-18,72,329-->

This method can be used where {@{the deviation of the input and output signals in a network stay within a substantially linear portion of the non-linear devices transfer function}@}, or else {@{are so small that the curve of the transfer function can be considered linear}@}. Under {@{a set of these specific conditions}@}, the non-linear device can be {@{represented by an equivalent linear network}@}. It must be remembered that {@{this equivalent circuit is entirely notional and only valid for the small signal deviations}@}. It is entirely {@{inapplicable to the dc biasing of the device}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-24,78,340!2025-06-23,77,340!2025-06-27,81,340!2026-01-23,238,330!2025-06-25,79,340!2025-06-09,66,329-->

For {@{a simple two-terminal device}@}, {@{the small signal equivalent circuit may be no more than two components}@}: {@{A resistance equal to the slope of the v/i curve at the operating point \(called the dynamic resistance\)}@}, and {@{tangent to the curve}@}; {@{A generator}@}, because {@{this tangent will not, in general, pass through the origin}@}. With {@{more terminals, more complicated equivalent circuits are required}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-22,76,329!2026-02-05,251,330!2025-10-27,165,320!2025-06-17,71,329!2025-06-27,81,340!2025-06-24,78,340!2026-02-18,260,330-->

A popular form of {@{specifying the small signal equivalent circuit amongst transistor manufacturers}@} is to {@{use the two-port network parameters known as [\[h\] parameters](two-port%20network.md#hybrid%20parameters%20(h-parameters))}@}. These are {@{a matrix of four parameters as with the \[z\] parameters}@} but in the case of {@{the \[h\] parameters they are a hybrid mixture of impedances, admittances, current gains and voltage gains}@}. In this model {@{the three terminal transistor is considered to be a two port network}@}, {@{one of its terminals being common to both ports}@}. The \[h\] parameters are {@{quite different depending on which terminal is chosen as the common one}@}. {@{The most important parameter for transistors}@} is {@{usually the forward current gain, h<sub>21</sub>, in the common emitter configuration}@}. This is {@{designated h<sub>fe</sub> on data sheets}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-11,67,310!2025-06-21,75,329!2025-06-14,70,329!2025-06-27,81,340!2025-06-29,83,340!2025-06-22,76,329!2025-06-24,78,340!2025-06-10,67,329!2025-06-25,79,340!2025-06-12,68,329-->

{@{The small signal equivalent circuit in terms of two-port parameters}@} leads to {@{the concept of dependent generators}@}. That is, {@{the value of a voltage or current generator}@} {@{depends linearly on a voltage or current elsewhere in the circuit}@}. For instance {@{the \[z\] parameter model leads to dependent voltage generators}@} as shown in this diagram; <!--SR:!2025-06-19,73,329!2025-06-11,67,310!2025-06-06,63,310!2025-06-17,71,329!2025-06-10,67,329-->

> {@{\[z\] parameter equivalent circuit showing dependent voltage generators}@} <!--SR:!2025-10-18,151,309!2025-06-10,67,329-->

There will {@{always be dependent generators in a two-port parameter equivalent circuit}@}. This applies to {@{the \[h\] parameters as well as to the \[z\] and any other kind}@}. These dependencies {@{must be preserved when developing the equations in a larger linear network analysis}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-20,74,329!2025-06-17,71,329!2025-12-03,193,310-->

#### piecewise linear method

In this method, {@{the transfer function of the non-linear device}@} is {@{broken up into regions}@}. Each of these regions is {@{approximated by a straight line}@}. Thus, the transfer function will be {@{linear up to a particular point where there will be a discontinuity}@}. Past this point {@{the transfer function will again be linear but with a different slope}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-20,74,329!2026-01-30,245,330!2026-01-25,240,330!2025-06-09,66,329!2025-06-23,77,340-->

{@{A well known application of this method}@} is {@{the approximation of the transfer function of a pn junction diode}@}. {@{The transfer function of an ideal diode}@} has been {@{given at the top of this \(non-linear\) section}@}. However, this formula is {@{rarely used in network analysis, a piecewise approximation being used instead}@}. It can be seen that {@{the diode current rapidly diminishes to -I<sub>o</sub> as the voltage falls}@}. This current, {@{for most purposes, is so small it can be ignored}@}. With {@{increasing voltage, the current increases exponentially}@}. The diode is modelled as {@{an open circuit up to the knee of the exponential curve}@}, then {@{past this point as a resistor equal to the [bulk resistance](bulk%20resistance.md) of the semiconducting material}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,81,340!2025-06-09,66,329!2025-06-10,67,329!2025-06-25,79,340!2026-02-13,256,330!2026-02-02,248,330!2026-01-28,243,330!2025-06-21,75,329!2026-02-27,268,330!2025-07-22,81,270-->

{@{The commonly accepted values for the transition point voltage}@} are {@{0.7V for silicon devices and 0.3V for germanium devices}@}. {@{An even simpler model of the diode, sometimes used in switching applications}@}, is {@{short circuit for forward voltages and open circuit for reverse voltages}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-27,81,340!2026-01-24,239,330!2025-06-10,67,329!2025-06-10,67,329-->

{@{The model of a forward biased pn junction having an approximately constant 0.7V}@} is also {@{a much used approximation for transistor base-emitter junction voltage in amplifier design}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-19,73,329!2025-12-14,208,340-->

The piecewise method is {@{similar to the small signal method}@} in that {@{linear network analysis techniques can only be applied if the signal stays within certain bounds}@}. If {@{the signal crosses a discontinuity point then the model is no longer valid for linear analysis purposes}@}. The model does {@{have the advantage over small signal}@} however, in that it is {@{equally applicable to signal and dc bias}@}. These can therefore {@{both be analysed in the same operations and will be linearly superimposable}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-22,76,329!2025-06-19,73,329!2025-06-28,82,340!2026-01-29,244,330!2026-01-29,244,330!2025-06-22,76,329-->

### time-varying components

In linear analysis, {@{the components of the network are assumed to be unchanging}@}, but {@{in some circuits this does not apply}@}, such as {@{sweep oscillators, [voltage controlled amplifiers](voltage%20controlled%20amplifier.md), and variable [equalisers](electronic%20filter.md)}@}. In many circumstances {@{the change in component value is periodic}@}. {@{A non-linear component excited with a periodic signal}@}, for instance, can be {@{represented as a periodically varying _linear_ component}@}. {@{[Sidney Darlington](Sidney%20Darlington.md) disclosed a method}@} of {@{analysing such periodic time varying circuits}@}. He developed {@{canonical circuit forms}@} which are {@{analogous to the canonical forms of [Ronald M. Foster](Ronald%20M.%20Foster.md) and [Wilhelm Cauer](Wilhelm%20Cauer.md) used for analysing linear circuits}@}.<sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-02-10,255,330!2025-06-25,79,340!2026-02-04,250,330!2025-06-23,77,340!2026-02-23,263,340!2025-06-10,67,329!2025-06-13,69,329!2026-02-26,267,330!2025-06-12,68,329!2025-06-29,83,340-->

{@{Generalization of circuit theory based on scalar quantities to vectorial currents}@} is {@{a necessity for newly evolving circuits such as spin circuits}@}.<sup>\[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please%20clarify)_\]</sup> {@{Generalized circuit variables}@} consist of {@{four components: scalar current and vector spin current in x, y, and z directions}@}. {@{The voltages and currents}@} each become {@{vector quantities with conductance described as a 4x4 spin conductance matrix}@}.<sup>\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation%20needed)_\]</sup> <!--SR:!2025-06-27,81,340!2025-06-28,82,340!2025-11-22,186,310!2025-06-06,63,310!2026-01-25,240,330!2025-06-11,67,310-->
