# apparent retrograde motion

__Apparent retrograde motion__ is {@{the apparent motion of a [planet](planet.md) in a direction opposite to that of other bodies within its system, as observed from a particular vantage point}@}. {@{__Direct motion__ or __prograde motion__}@} is {@{motion in the same direction as other bodies}@}. From [Earth](Earth.md), {@{the [Moon](Moon.md)'s eastward motion day after day is the direction of direct motion}@}. <!--SR:!2027-01-01,638,310!2028-04-06,1065,350!2026-10-11,630,330!2027-03-15,738,330-->

## apparent motion

### from Earth

All [stars](star.md) and [planets](planet.md) appear to {@{move from [east](east.md) to [west](west.md) due to [Earth](Earth.md)'s rotation, called [diurnal motion](diurnal%20motion.md)}@}. Excluding this motion (by {@{comparing the change in position in the [sky](sky.md) at the same time of each day}@}), all other [planetary bodies](planetary-mass%20object.md) in the [Solar System](Solar%20System.md) also {@{appear to move from the east to west as they cross Earth's sky, but periodically switch direction}@}. <!--SR:!2027-01-19,707,330!2028-06-19,1119,350!2025-11-13,351,290-->

The outer planets generally {@{drift slowly eastward relative to the stars}@}, but [asteroids](asteriod.md) and [Kuiper belt](Kuiper%20belt.md) objects (including [Pluto](Pluto.md)) exhibit {@{apparent retrograde motion}@}. As the eastward motion is {@{normal for the planets, and so is considered direct motion}@}. However, since Earth {@{completes its orbit in a shorter period of time than the planets outside its orbit, it periodically overtakes them, like a faster car on a multi-lane highway}@}. When this occurs, the planet being passed will {@{first appear to stop its eastward drift, and then drift back toward the west}@}. Then, as Earth {@{swings past the planet in its orbit, it appears to resume its normal motion west to east}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-27,400,290!2026-02-07,388,290!2028-03-20,1053,350!2027-02-04,721,330!2027-05-26,789,330!2025-10-18,346,310-->

Inner planets {@{[Venus](Venus.md) and [Mercury](Mercury%20(planet).md)}@} appear to {@{move in retrograde in a similar mechanism}@}, but as {@{they can never be in opposition to the [Sun](Sun.md) as seen from [Earth](Earth.md), their retrograde cycles are tied to their inferior [conjunctions](conjunction%20(astronomy).md) with the Sun}@}. They, when in retrograde motion, are likely {@{unobservable in the Sun's glare and in their "new" phase, with mostly their dark sides toward Earth}@}; they occur in the transition {@{from evening star to morning star (for Venus; reversed for Mercury)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-07-30,520,310!2026-08-26,547,310!2027-05-27,743,290!2025-12-01,376,310!2025-06-15,219,270-->
