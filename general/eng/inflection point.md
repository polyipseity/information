# inflection point

An __inflection point__, __point of inflection__, __flex__, __inflection__, or __inflexion__ is {@{a [point](point%20(geometry).md) of a [smooth plane curve](plane%20curve.md#smooth%20plane%20curve) at which the [curvature](curvature.md) changes sign}@}. Particularly, in the [graph of a function](graph%20of%20a%20function.md), an inflection point is {@{a point at which the [function](function%20(mathematics).md) changes from [convex](convex%20function.md) to [concave](concave%20function.md) or [concave](concave%20function.md) to [convex](convex%20function.md)}@}.

For functions of [differentiability class](smoothness.md#differentiability%20class) $C^2$, an inflection point {@{[necessities](necessity%20and%20sufficiency.md) $f''=0$, but the converse is not true}@}. A point where {@{$f''=0$ but the [curvature](curvature.md) does not change is called an __undulation point__ or __point of undulation__}@}.
