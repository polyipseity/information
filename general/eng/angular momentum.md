# angular momentum

In [physics](physics.md), __angular momentum__ (sometimes called {@{__moment of momentum__ or __rotational momentum__}@}) is {@{the [rotational](rotation.md) analog of [linear momentum](momentum.md)}@}. Likewise, it is also {@{a [conserved quantity](conservation%20law.md)–the total angular momentum of a [closed system](closed%20system.md) remains constant}@}.

## conservation of angular momentum

### general considerations

The conservation of angular momentum is used in {@{analyzing [_central force motion_](classical%20central-force%20problem.md)}@}. If {@{the [net force](net%20force.md) on some body is directed always toward some point, the center}@}, then {@{there is no [torque](torque.md) on the body with respect to the center}@}, as {@{all of the force is directed along the [radius vector](position%20(geometry).md), and none is [perpendicular](perpendicular) to the [radius](radius.md)}@}. Mathematically, torque {@{$\mathbf \tau = \mathbf r \times \mathbf F = \mathbf 0$, because $\mathbf r$ and $\mathbf F$ are parallel vectors}@} in this case. Therefore, the angular momentum of the body {@{about the center is constant}@}. This is the case with {@{[gravitational attraction](gravity.md) in the [orbits](orbit.md) of [planets](planet.md) and [satellites](natural%20satellite.md)}@}, where {@{the gravitational force is always directed toward the [primary body](primary%20body.md)}@}. Intuitively, the orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by {@{exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary}@}. Central force motion is also used in {@{the analysis of the [Bohr model](Bohr%20model.md) of the [atom](atom.md)}@}.
