# carbon monoxide

## occurrence

### astronomy

Beyond Earth, carbon monoxide is {@{the second-most common diatomic molecule in the [interstellar medium](interstellar%20medium.md), after [molecular hydrogen](hydrogen.md)}@}. Because of {@{its asymmetry}@}, this [polar molecule](chemical%20polarity.md#polar%20molecules) produces {@{far brighter [spectral lines](spectral%20line.md) than the hydrogen molecule, making CO much easier to detect}@}. Interstellar CO was first detected with {@{[radio telescopes](radio%20telescope.md) in 1970}@}. It is now {@{the most commonly used tracer of molecular gas in general in the interstellar medium of galaxies}@}, as {@{molecular hydrogen can only be detected using ultraviolet light, which requires [space telescopes](space%20telescope.md)}@}. Carbon monoxide observations provide {@{much of the information about the [molecular clouds](molecular%20cloud.md) in which most [stars form](star%20formation.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-07-27,819,330!2029-07-25,1415,350!2028-08-14,1067,310!2027-02-15,565,230!2028-10-20,1038,290!2027-01-06,639,290!2027-02-13,704,330-->
