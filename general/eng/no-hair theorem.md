# no-hair theorem

The __no-hair theorem__ (which is {@{a hypothesis}@}) states that {@{all stationary [black hole](black%20hole.md) solutions of the [Einsteinâ€“Maxwell equations](einstein%20field%20equations.md#Einstein%E2%80%93Maxwell%20equations) of [gravitation](gravity.md) and [electromagnetism](electromagnetism.md) in [general relativity](general%20relativity.md)}@} can be {@{completely characterized by only three independent _externally_ observable [classical](classical%20physics.md) parameters}@}: {@{[mass](mass.md), [electric charge](electric%20charge.md), and [angular momentum](angular%20momentum.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2028-08-12,1143,350!2026-08-24,403,250!2025-08-26,162,317!2025-07-27,4,287-->
