> Decomposing {@{[total costs](total%20cost.md) as fixed costs plus variable costs}@}. Quantity of output is {@{measured on the horizontal axis}@}. Along with variable costs, {@{fixed costs make up one of the two components of total cost}@}: {@{total cost is equal to fixed costs plus variable costs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-19,291,330!2026-01-02,276,330-->

In {@{[accounting](accounting.md) and [economics](economics.md)}@}, {@{__fixed costs__, also known as __indirect costs__ or __overhead costs__}@}, are {@{business [expenses](expenses.md) that are not dependent on the level of goods or services produced by the business}@}. They tend {@{to be recurring}@}, such as {@{interest or rents being paid per month}@}. These costs also tend {@{to be capital costs}@}. This is in contrast to {@{[variable costs](variable%20costs.md)}@}, which are {@{volume-related \(and are paid per quantity produced\) and unknown at the beginning of the accounting year}@}. Fixed costs have {@{an effect on the nature of certain variable costs}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-08,280,330!2025-12-04,254,330!2025-10-30,209,310!2025-12-31,276,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-21,293,330!2026-01-11,285,330!2025-12-14,262,330!2026-01-23,294,330-->

For example, a [retailer](retail.md) must {@{pay rent and utility bills irrespective of sales}@}. As another example, for a [bakery](bakery.md) {@{the monthly rent and phone line are fixed costs}@}, irrespective of {@{how much bread is produced and sold}@}; on the other hand, {@{the wages are variable costs}@}, as {@{more workers would need to be hired for the production to increase}@}. For any factory, the fix cost should be {@{all the money paid on capitals and land}@}. Such fixed costs as {@{buying machines and land}@} {@{cannot be changed no matter how much they produce or even not produce}@}. {@{Raw materials}@} are {@{one of the variable costs, depending on the quantity produced}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-09,281,330!2027-11-14,780,330!2026-01-09,281,330!2026-01-13,285,330!2026-01-19,291,330!2026-01-09,283,330!2026-01-07,280,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-12,284,330!2027-08-01,709,330-->

Fixed costs are {@{considered an [entry barrier](barriers%20to%20entry.md)}@} for new [entrepreneurs](entrepreneurs.md). In {@{[marketing](marketing.md)}@}, it is {@{necessary to know how costs divide between variable and fixed costs}@}. This distinction is crucial in {@{forecasting the [earnings](earnings.md) generated by various changes in unit sales and thus the financial impact of proposed marketing campaigns}@}. In {@{a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers}@}, 60 percent responded that {@{they found the "variable and fixed costs" metric very useful}@}. These costs {@{affect each other}@} and are {@{both extremely important}@} to entrepreneurs. <sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-14,286,330!2026-01-04,278,330!2025-11-29,250,330!2026-09-25,457,310!2026-01-20,292,330!2025-12-31,276,330!2025-12-13,260,330!2026-01-10,282,330-->

In {@{economics}@}, there is {@{a fixed cost for a factory in the short run}@}, and {@{the fixed cost is immutable}@}. But {@{in the long run, there are only variable costs}@}, because {@{they control all factors of production}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-10,283,330!2025-10-14,196,310!2026-01-10,282,330!2026-01-05,279,330!2025-12-12,259,330-->

## description

Fixed costs are {@{not permanently fixed}@}; they will {@{change over time, but are fixed}@}, by {@{contractual obligation, in relation to the quantity of production for the relevant period}@}. In other words, there is {@{a recurring cost}@}, but {@{the value of this cost is not permanently fixed}@}. For example, a company may {@{have unexpected and unpredictable expenses unrelated to production}@}, such as {@{warehouse costs and the like that are fixed only over the time period of the lease}@}. By definition, there are {@{no fixed costs in the long run}@}, because {@{the long run is a sufficient period of time for all short-run fixed inputs to become variable}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> {@{Investments in facilities, equipment, and the basic organization}@} that {@{cannot be significantly reduced in a short period of time}@} are referred to as {@{committed fixed costs}@}. {@{Discretionary fixed costs}@} usually arise from {@{annual decisions by management to spend on certain fixed cost items}@}. Examples of discretionary costs are {@{advertising, insurance premia, machine maintenance, and research & development expenditures}@}. Discretionary fixed costs can be {@{expensive}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-01-06,280,330!2027-04-28,586,310!2026-01-09,282,330!2026-01-11,284,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-21,293,330!2025-12-05,255,330!2025-12-31,276,330!2025-12-21,267,330!2025-10-19,200,310!2027-02-03,552,310!2025-12-09,258,330!2026-01-08,280,330!2026-07-27,420,310!2027-11-26,802,330!2025-10-18,25,367-->

In {@{economics}@}, the most commonly spoken about fixed costs are {@{those that have to do with capital}@}. Capital can be {@{the fixed price for buying a warehouse for production, machines}@} \(which can be {@{paid once at the beginning and not depend on quantity or time of production}@}\), and it can be {@{a certain total for the salaries of a certain quantity of unskilled labor}@}. Many things are included in fixed costs {@{depending on the product and market}@} - some firms may {@{decide to hold some resources at fixed rates that other companies may not}@} - but {@{these unexpected or predictable short term fixed costs}@} can be {@{the reason a firm doesn't enter the market \(if the costs are too high\)}@}. {@{These costs and variable costs}@} have to be taken into account when {@{a firm wants to determine if they can enter a market}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-08,282,330!2026-09-16,409,290!2026-01-10,284,330!2025-12-31,276,330!2025-12-19,265,330!2025-09-26,195,310!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-11-19,240,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-12-09,94,385-->

In {@{business planning and management accounting}@}, {@{usage of the terms fixed costs, variable costs and others}@} will {@{often differ from usage in economics, and may depend on the context}@}. {@{Some [cost accounting](cost%20accounting.md) practices}@} such as {@{[activity-based costing](activity-based%20costing.md)}@} will allocate fixed costs to {@{business activities for profitability measures}@}. This can {@{simplify decision-making, but can be confusing and controversial}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup><sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup> In {@{accounting terminology}@}, fixed costs will {@{broadly include almost all costs \(expenses\) which are not included in [cost of goods sold](cost%20of%20goods%20sold.md)}@}, and variable costs are {@{those captured in costs of goods sold under the variable costing method}@}. Under {@{full \(absorption\) costing}@} fixed costs will be included in {@{both the cost of goods sold and in the operating expenses}@}. The implicit assumption required to {@{make the equivalence between the accounting and economics terminology}@} is that {@{the accounting period is equal to the period in which fixed costs do not vary in relation to production}@}. In practice, {@{this equivalence does not always hold}@}, and depending on {@{the period under consideration by management}@}, {@{some overhead expenses \(e.g., sales, general and administrative expenses\) can be adjusted by management}@}, and {@{the specific allocation of each expense to each category}@} will be decided {@{under [cost accounting](cost%20accounting.md)}@}. In recent years, {@{fixed costs gradually exceed variable costs}@} for many companies. There are {@{two reasons}@}. Firstly, {@{automatic production increases the cost of investment equipment}@}, including {@{the depreciation and maintenance of old equipment}@}. Secondly, {@{labor costs are often considered as long-term costs}@}. It is {@{difficult to adjust human resources according to the actual work needs in short term}@}. As a result, {@{direct labor costs are now regarded as fixed costs}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-12,259,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-12-10,259,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-15,287,330!2026-08-11,433,310!2027-07-14,700,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-12-08,257,330!2027-11-27,802,330!2025-12-18,264,330!2026-07-26,420,310!2026-01-11,283,330!2026-04-30,340,290!2026-01-23,294,330!2026-01-03,277,330!2026-01-18,290,330!2026-01-16,288,330!2026-01-22,294,330!2026-01-23,294,330!2025-09-29,186,310!2025-12-02,252,330!2026-01-20,292,330!2027-12-19,819,330!2025-10-31,210,310!2026-01-17,289,330-->
