# substitution effect

In {@{[economics](economics.md) and particularly in [consumer choice theory](consumer%20choice.md)}@}, the __substitution effect__ is {@{one component of the effect of a change in the price of a good upon the amount of that good demanded by a consumer}@}, the other being {@{the [income effect](consumer%20choice.md#income%20effect)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-10,256,332!2026-11-17,517,312!2025-11-30,294,332-->

When {@{a good's price decreases, if hypothetically the same consumption bundle were to be retained}@}, income would be {@{freed up which could be spent on a combination of more of each of the goods}@}. Thus {@{the new total consumption bundle chosen}@}, compared to the old one, reflects both {@{the effect of the changed [relative prices](relative%20price.md) of the two goods (one unit of one good can now be traded for a different quantity of the other good than before as the ratio of their prices has changed) _and_ the effect of the freed-up income}@}. {@{The effect of the relative price change is called the _substitution effect_}@}, while {@{the effect due to income having been freed up is called the _[income effect](consumer%20choice.md#income%20effect)_}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-11,281,332!2025-12-03,297,332!2025-10-05,252,332!2026-04-02,339,292!2025-12-05,299,332!2025-08-17,196,312-->

If {@{income is altered in response to the price change such that a new budget line}@} is {@{drawn passing through the old consumption bundle but with the slope determined by the new prices and the consumer's optimal choice is on this budget line}@}, {@{the resulting change in consumption}@} is {@{called the __Slutsky substitution effect__}@}. The idea is that {@{the consumer is given enough money to purchase his old bundle at the new prices}@}, and {@{his choice changes are seen}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-14,259,332!2026-09-03,392,272!2025-12-04,298,332!2026-08-28,479,312!2027-09-20,786,332!2025-12-04,298,332-->

If instead, {@{a new budget line is found with the slope determined by the new prices}@} but {@{tangent to the indifference curve going through the old bundle}@}, {@{the difference between the new point of tangency and the old bundle}@} is {@{the __Hicks substitution effect__}@}. The idea now is that {@{the consumer is given just enough income to achieve his old utility at the new prices}@}, and {@{how his choice changes is seen}@}. {@{The Hicks substitution effect}@} is illustrated in the next section. <!--SR:!2026-05-08,272,292!2026-04-15,349,292!2025-11-05,276,332!2026-04-03,340,292!2025-12-05,299,332!2025-10-09,255,332!2025-11-02,274,332-->

Some authors refer to {@{one of these two concepts as simply the substitution effect}@}. {@{The popular textbook by [Varian](Hal%20Varian.md)}@}<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> describes {@{the Slutsky variant as the primary one, but also gives a good explanation of the distinction}@}. <!--SR:!2025-11-02,274,332!2025-11-30,294,332!2026-11-20,539,312-->

The same concepts also apply if {@{the price of one good goes up instead of down}@}, with {@{the substitution effect reflecting the change in relative prices}@} and {@{the income effect reflecting the fact the income has been soaked up into additional spending on the retained units of the now-pricier good}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-03,297,332!2027-09-30,802,332!2027-10-16,815,332-->

For example, consider {@{[coffee](coffee.md) and [tea](tea.md)}@}. If {@{the price of coffee increased}@}, consumers {@{of hot drinks may decide to start drinking tea instead}@}. This will {@{cause the demand for tea to increase}@}. Likewise, if {@{the price of coffee was to decrease}@}, {@{tea-drinkers may decide to shift their drinking habits and substitute coffee for their daily drinking habits}@}, causing {@{the demand for tea to decrease}@}. <!--SR:!2027-10-02,803,332!2025-12-01,295,332!2025-11-01,273,332!2027-08-24,773,332!2025-12-04,298,332!2027-04-15,673,332!2025-12-01,295,332-->

Economists had {@{long understood that changes in price could lead to two main responses by consumers}@}, {@{initial work on this subject}@} had been done by {@{[Vilfredo Pareto](Vilfredo%20Pareto.md) in the 1890s}@}, but it {@{wasn't until [Eugen Slutsky](Eugen%20Slutsky.md)'s 1915 article}@} that {@{rigor was brought to the subject}@}. Because {@{Slutsky's original paper was published during World War I in Italian}@}, {@{economists in the Anglo-American world did not become aware of Slutsky's contributions until the 1930s}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> The English world was {@{fully introduced to Slutsky's ideas in 1934}@} when {@{"A Reconsideration of the Theory of Value" was published by [John Hicks](John%20Hicks.md) and [RGD Allen](R.%20G.%20D.%20Allen.md)}@}, this paper built upon {@{work by Pareto and came to conclusions Slutsky had realized two decades prior}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-07,278,332!2025-12-03,297,332!2026-07-04,441,312!2025-09-09,212,312!2025-12-02,296,332!2025-12-01,295,332!2025-09-08,211,312!2026-11-16,535,312!2026-02-22,337,292!2026-07-03,440,312-->

Suppose {@{the initial situation is given by the graph (with good Y plotted horizontally)}@} with {@{the indicated (and never-changing) [indifference curves](indifference%20curve.md) shown and with [budget constraint](budget%20constraint.md) BC1}@} and with {@{the consumer choosing point A because it puts him on the highest possible indifference curve consistent with BC1}@}. {@{The position and slope of the budget constraint}@} are based on {@{the consumer's income and on the prices of the two goods X and Y}@}. If {@{the price of Y falls}@}, {@{the budget constraint pivots to BC2, with a greater intercept of good Y}@} because {@{if all income were spent on Y more of it could be purchased at the now-lower price}@}. {@{The overall effect of the price change}@} is that {@{the consumer now chooses the consumption bundle at point C}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-15,764,332!2025-12-06,300,332!2026-02-23,311,292!2025-12-06,300,332!2025-10-27,269,332!2025-11-30,294,332!2026-11-02,502,312!2027-10-09,809,332!2025-11-10,280,332!2025-10-15,260,332-->

But {@{the move from A to C can be decomposed into two parts}@}. {@{The __substitution effect__}@} is {@{the change that would occur if the consumer were required to remain on the original indifference curve}@}; this is the move from A to B. {@{The income effect}@} is {@{the simultaneous move from B to C that occurs}@} because {@{the lower price of one good in fact allows movement to a higher indifference curve}@}. (In this graph {@{Y is an inferior good}@} since {@{C is to the left of B so Y<sub>2</sub> < Y<sub>s</sub>}@}.) <!--SR:!2025-12-02,296,332!2025-11-09,279,332!2025-12-05,299,332!2027-04-14,672,332!2025-12-05,299,332!2025-10-25,267,330!2025-11-11,281,332!2026-04-04,340,292-->

## elasticity of substitution

{@{The concept of the elasticity of substitution}@} was {@{developed by two different economists}@}, each with {@{their own focus}@}. One of these economists was {@{[John Hicks](John%20Hicks.md)}@}, who defined elasticity of substitution as {@{the change in percentage in the relative number of factors of production used, given a particular change in percentage in relative prices or marginal products}@}. This definition is also known as {@{the direct elasticity of substitution}@}. The other economist was {@{[Joan Robinson](Joan%20Robinson.md)}@}, who defined elasticity of substitution as {@{the change in proportion of the ratio of the number of factors used divided by the change in proportion of the ratio of each factor's prices}@}. {@{These two definitions function in the same way}@} when {@{limited to two factors of production}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-11-06,277,332!2027-09-25,798,332!2025-10-26,268,332!2025-11-12,282,332!2025-08-21,160,232!2026-02-16,331,292!2026-05-26,416,312!2026-04-11,346,292!2027-03-14,652,332!2025-12-06,300,332-->
