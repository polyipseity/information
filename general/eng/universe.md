# universe

The __universe__ is {@{all of [space](space.md) and [time](time.md) and their contents}@}.

## composition

- see: [galaxy cluster](galaxy%20cluster.md), [galaxy formation and evolution](galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md), [nebula](nebula.md)

The universe is composed {@{almost completely of dark energy, dark matter, and [ordinary matter](matter.md)}@}. Other contents are {@{[electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) (estimated to constitute from 0.005% to close to 0.01% of the total [mass–energy](mass–energy%20equivalence.md) of the universe) and [antimatter](antimatter.md)}@}.

{@{The proportions of all types of matter and energy}@} have {@{changed over the history of the universe}@}. {@{The total amount of electromagnetic radiation generated within the universe}@} has {@{decreased by 1/2 in the past 2 billion years}@}. Today, {@{ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and [life](life.md)}@}, accounts for {@{only 4.9% of the contents of the universe}@}. The present overall [density](density.md) of this type of matter is {@{very low, roughly 4.5×10<sup>−31</sup> grams per cubic centimeter, corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic metres of volume}@}. {@{The nature of both dark energy and dark matter}@} is {@{unknown}@}. {@{Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified}@}, accounts for {@{26.8% of the cosmic contents}@}. {@{Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate}@}, accounts for {@{the remaining 68.3% of the contents}@}.
