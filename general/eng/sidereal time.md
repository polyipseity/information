# sidereal time

__Sidereal time__ is {@{a calculation of the passage of [time](time.md) based on the positions of the [fixed stars](fixed%20stars.md)}@}. The fundamental unit of sidereal time is {@{the __sidereal day__, which is not the "day" most people are familiar with}@}. <!--SR:!2027-08-25,865,330!2025-06-24,274,330-->

A sidereal day on [Earth](Earth.md) is {@{approximately 86&nbsp;164.0905 seconds (23 h 56 min 4.0905 s or 23.934&nbsp;4696 h)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-12-15,263,210-->

## comparison to solar time

[Earth](Earth.md) makes {@{one rotation around its axis each sidereal day}@}; during that time {@{it moves a short distance (about 1Â°) along its [orbit](orbit.md) around the [Sun](Sun.md)}@}. So after a sidereal day has passed, Earth {@{still needs to rotate slightly more before the Sun reaches local noon according to [solar time](solar%20time.md)}@}. A mean solar day is, therefore, {@{nearly 3 minutes 56 seconds longer than a sidereal day}@}. <!--SR:!2026-10-08,630,330!2025-07-02,282,330!2027-02-16,729,330!2027-08-24,814,290-->

## sidereal days compared to solar days on other planets

For [prograde rotation](prograde%20motion.md), the formula relating the lengths of the sidereal and [solar days](synodic%20day.md) is: {@{$$\text{number of sidereal days per orbital period} = \text{number of solar days per orbital period} + 1$$}@}. Equivalently in terms of length, {@{$$\begin{aligned} \text{length of sidereal day} & = \frac {\text{length of solar day} } {1 + \frac {\text{length of solar day} } {\text{orbital period} } } \\ \text{length of solar day} & = \frac {\text{length of sidereal day} } {1 - \frac {\text{length of sidereal day} } {\text{orbital period} } } \end{aligned}$$}@}. The reasons for above formulas are {@{similar to those for the [coin rotation paradox](coin%20rotation%20paradox.md)}@}. The same analogy for [retrograde rotation](retrograde%20motion.md) {@{would require the coin to slip at a particular speed, so does not exist sensibly}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-18,742,330!2027-01-24,628,290!2026-09-17,596,310!2025-06-30,280,330-->

For [retrograde rotation](prograde%20motion.md), the formula has {@{the sign of $1$ negated}@}: {@{$$\text{number of sidereal days per orbital period} = \text{number of solar days per orbital period} - 1$$}@}. Equivalently in terms of length, the formula has {@{the operator sign in the denominator negated}@}: {@{$$\begin{aligned} \text{length of sidereal day} & = \frac {\text{length of solar day} } {1 - \frac {\text{length of solar day} } {\text{orbital period} } } \\ \text{length of solar day} & = \frac {\text{length of sidereal day} } {1 + \frac {\text{length of sidereal day} } {\text{orbital period} } } \end{aligned}$$}@}. <!--SR:!2028-07-10,1141,350!2028-06-13,1119,350!2028-09-12,1194,350!2026-07-23,478,270-->
