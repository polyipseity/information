# direct labour cost variance

{@{__Direct labour cost [variance](variance%20(accounting).md)__}@} is {@{the difference between the standard [cost](cost.md) for actual [production](manufacturing.md)}@} and {@{the actual cost in production}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-08-22,16,290!2025-10-16,57,310!2025-10-19,59,310-->

There are {@{two kinds of labour variances}@}. {@{_Labour Rate Variance_}@} is {@{the difference between the standard cost}@} and {@{the actual cost paid for the actual number of hours}@}. {@{_Labour efficiency variance_}@} is {@{the difference between the standard [labour](labour%20(economics).md) hour that should have been worked for the actual number of units produced}@} and {@{the actual number of hours worked when the labour hours are valued at the standard rate}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-20,60,310!2025-08-22,16,290!2025-10-15,56,310!2025-08-22,16,290!2025-10-14,55,310!2025-10-20,60,310!2025-10-17,58,310-->

## labour efficiency variance

Difference between {@{the amount of labor time that should have been used}@} and {@{the labor that was actually used}@}, multiplied by {@{the standard rate}@}. For example, assume that {@{the standard cost of direct labor per unit of product A}@} is {@{2.5 hours x \$14 = \$35}@}. Assume further that during the month of March the company {@{recorded 4500 hours of direct labor time}@}. {@{The actual cost of this labor time}@} was {@{\$64,800, or an average of \$14.40 per hour}@}. The company {@{produced 2000 units of product A during the month}@}. {@{The labor efficiency variance}@} is {@{\(5000 - 4500\) x \$14 = \$7000 \(annotation: F\)}@}, where {@{5000 hours = 2.5 hours x 2000 units of output}@}. {@{This variance is favorable}@} since {@{the actual hours used are less than the standard hours allowed}@}. This may be the result of {@{efficient use of labor time due to automation or the use of improved production methods}@}. <!--SR:!2025-10-20,60,310!2025-08-22,16,290!2025-10-19,59,310!2025-10-17,58,310!2025-08-22,16,290!2025-10-20,60,310!2025-10-19,59,310!2025-08-22,16,290!2025-08-22,16,290!2025-08-22,16,290!2025-10-19,59,310!2025-10-13,54,310!2025-08-22,16,290!2025-10-14,55,310!2025-10-15,56,310-->
