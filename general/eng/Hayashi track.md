# Hayashi track

The __Hayashi track__ is {@{a luminosity–temperature relationship obeyed by infant stars of less than 3 [M<sub>☉</sub>](solar%20mass.md) in the [pre-main-sequence phase](pre-main-sequence%20star.md) (PMS phase) of stellar evolution}@}. It is named after {@{Japanese astrophysicist [Chushiro Hayashi](Chushiro%20Hayashi.md)}@}. On the [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md), which {@{plots luminosity against temperature, the track is a nearly vertical curve}@}. After a [protostar](protostar.md) {@{ends its phase of rapid contraction and becomes a [T Tauri star](T%20Tauri%20star.md)}@}, it is {@{extremely luminous}@}. The star {@{continues to contract, but much more slowly}@}. While {@{slowly contracting}@}, the star {@{follows the Hayashi track downwards, becoming several times less luminous but staying at roughly the same surface temperature}@}, until {@{either a [radiative zone](radiation%20zone.md) develops, at which point the star starts following the [Henyey track](Henyey%20track.md), or nuclear fusion begins, marking its entry onto the [main sequence](main%20sequence.md)}@}.
