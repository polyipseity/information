# main sequence turnoff

The __turnoff point__ for a [star](star.md) refers to {@{the point on the [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md) where it leaves the main sequence after its main fuel is exhausted – the __main sequence turnoff__}@}. <!--SR:!2027-06-03,784,330-->

By {@{plotting the turnoff points of individual [stars](star.md)}@} in a [star cluster](star%20cluster.md) one can {@{[estimate the cluster's age](main%20sequence.md#evolutionary%20tracks.md)}@}. The graph would look like {@{a diagonal candle burning from top-left to bottom-right, with subgiant stars starting to shift up-right (looking like "smoke"; initially there is no "smoke" as no stars are dying) over (extremely long) time}@}. The turnoff point for the cluster is {@{the topmost star in the HR diagram that has not yet shifted up-right from the main sequence strip at all}@}. <!--SR:!2027-10-21,897,330!2027-03-09,716,330!2026-07-07,452,270!2027-01-09,617,310-->
