__Zorn's lemma__, also known as the {@{__Kuratowski–Zorn lemma__}@}, is {@{a proposition of [set theory](set%20theory.md)}@}.

## motivation

To prove {@{the existence of a mathematical object}@} that can be {@{viewed as a maximal element in some [partially ordered set](partially%20ordered%20set.md) in some way}@}, one can try {@{proving the existence of such an object}@} by {@{assuming there is no maximal element and using [transfinite induction](transfinite%20induction.md) and the assumptions of the situation to get a contradiction}@}. Zorn's lemma tidies up {@{the conditions a situation needs to satisfy in order for such an argument to work}@} and enables mathematicians to {@{not have to repeat the transfinite induction argument by hand each time}@}, but {@{just check the conditions of Zorn's lemma}@}. <!--SR:!2027-06-17,499,330!2029-02-11,1121,310!2030-07-13,1603,370!2028-01-12,857,338!2030-02-11,1480,370!2026-03-24,138,400!2026-03-24,138,400-->

## statement of the lemma

Preliminary notions:

- {@{A [set](set%20(mathematics).md) _P_}@} equipped with {@{a [binary relation](binary%20relation.md) ≤ that is [reflexive](reflexive%20relation.md) \(_x_ ≤ _x_ for every _x_\), [antisymmetric](antisymmetric%20relation.md) \(if both _x_ ≤ _y_ and _y_ ≤ _x_ hold, then _x_ = _y_\), and [transitive](transitive%20relation.md) \(if _x_ ≤ _y_ and _y_ ≤ _z_ then _x_ ≤ _z_\)}@} is said to be {@{[\(partially\) ordered](partially%20ordered%20set.md) by ≤}@}. Given {@{two elements _x_ and _y_ of _P_ with _x_ ≤ _y_}@}, _y_ is said to be {@{[greater than or equal to](inequality%20(mathematics).md) _x_}@}. {@{The word "partial"}@} is meant to {@{indicate that not every pair of elements of a partially ordered set is required to be [comparable](comparability.md) under the order relation}@}, that is, in {@{a partially ordered set _P_ with order relation ≤}@} there {@{may be elements _x_ and _y_ with neither _x_ ≤ _y_ nor _y_ ≤ _x_}@}. {@{An ordered set in which every pair of elements is comparable}@} is called {@{[totally ordered](total%20order.md)}@}.
- {@{Every subset _S_ of a partially ordered set _P_}@} can itself {@{be seen as partially ordered by [restricting](binary%20relation.md#restriction) the order relation inherited from _P_ to _S_}@}. {@{A subset _S_ of a partially ordered set _P_}@} is called {@{a [chain](total%20order.md#chains) \(in _P_\)}@} if {@{it is totally ordered in the inherited order}@}.
- {@{An element _m_ of a partially ordered set _P_ with order relation ≤}@} is {@{[maximal](maximal%20and%20minimal%20elements.md) \(with respect to ≤\)}@} if {@{there is no other element of _P_ greater than _m_}@}, that is, if {@{there is no _s_ in _P_ with _s_ ≠ _m_ and _m_ ≤ _s_}@}. Depending on the order relation, a partially ordered set {@{may have any number of maximal elements}@}. However, a totally ordered set {@{can have at most one maximal element}@}.
- Given {@{a subset _S_ of a partially ordered set _P_}@}, {@{an element _u_ of _P_ is an [upper bound](upper%20and%20lower%20bounds.md) of _S_}@} if {@{it is greater than or equal to every element of _S_}@}. Here, {@{_S_ is not required to be a chain}@}, and _u_ is {@{required to be comparable to every element of _S_ but need not itself be an element of _S_}@}. <!--SR:!2030-08-11,1627,370!2028-06-15,983,350!2028-10-10,1078,350!2028-07-26,1019,350!2026-03-06,343,350!2027-11-25,817,330!2030-06-15,1581,370!2030-08-02,1619,370!2030-06-24,1587,370!2026-03-09,346,350!2027-06-26,500,330!2030-01-26,1470,370!2029-04-28,1180,310!2026-03-16,352,350!2027-09-08,706,330!2028-05-15,960,350!2028-05-19,965,350!2028-06-19,987,350!2030-06-19,1583,370!2026-03-07,344,350!2028-01-10,856,338!2030-08-07,1623,370!2028-02-24,901,350!2028-08-23,1037,350!2028-06-08,978,350!2028-07-04,1001,350!2027-06-02,669,330-->

## example applications

### every vector space has a basis

Zorn's lemma can be used to {@{show that every [vector space](vector%20space.md) _V_ has a [basis](basis%20(linear%20algebra).md)}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-03-11,348,350-->

If {@{_V_ = {__0__}, then the empty set is a basis for _V_}@}. Now, {@{suppose that _V_ ≠ {__0__}<!-- flashcard separator -->}@}. Let {@{_P_ be the set consisting of all [linearly independent](linear%20independence.md) subsets of _V_}@}. Since {@{_V_ is not the [zero vector space](zero%20object%20(algebra).md#vector%20space)}@}, there {@{exists a nonzero element __v__ of _V_}@}, so {@{_P_ contains the linearly independent subset {__v__}<!-- flashcard separator -->}@}. Furthermore, {@{_P_ is partially ordered by [set inclusion](subset.md) \(see [inclusion order](inclusion%20order.md)\)}@}. Finding {@{a maximal linearly independent subset of _V_ is the same as finding a maximal element in _P_}@}. <!--SR:!2030-07-15,1605,370!2029-05-01,1245,358!2026-03-03,340,350!2029-05-08,1251,358!2026-03-16,352,350!2027-02-24,608,330!2030-07-16,1606,370!2027-01-21,571,330-->

To {@{apply Zorn's lemma}@}, take {@{a chain _T_ in _P_ \(that is, _T_ is a subset of _P_ that is totally ordered\)}@}. If {@{_T_ is the empty set}@}, then {@{<!-- flashcard separator -->{__v__} is an upper bound for _T_ in _P_}@}. Suppose {@{then that _T_ is non-empty}@}. We need to {@{show that _T_ has an upper bound, that is, there exists a linearly independent subset _B_ of _V_ containing all the members of _T_}@}. <!--SR:!2030-07-27,1615,370!2027-05-25,631,330!2028-12-25,1140,350!2028-08-01,1022,350!2027-01-18,568,330!2028-05-22,827,290-->

Take {@{_B_ to be the [union](union%20(set%20theory).md) of all the sets in _T_}@}. We wish to {@{show that _B_ is an upper bound for _T_ in _P_}@}. To do this, it {@{suffices to show that _B_ is a linearly independent subset of _V_}@}. <!--SR:!2028-09-24,1065,350!2026-03-05,343,350!2030-06-22,1586,370-->

Suppose {@{otherwise, that _B_ is not linearly independent}@}. Then {@{there exists vectors __v__<sub>1</sub>, __v__<sub>2</sub>, ..., __v__<sub>k</sub> ∈ _B_ and [scalars](scalar%20(mathematics).md) _a_<sub>1</sub>, _a_<sub>2</sub>, ..., _a_<sub>k</sub>, not all zero}@}, such that {@{$$a_{1}\mathbf {v} _{1}+a_{2}\mathbf {v} _{2}+\cdots +a_{k}\mathbf {v} _{k}=\mathbf {0} .$$}@} Since {@{_B_ is the union of all the sets in _T_}@}, there are {@{some sets _S_<sub>1</sub>, _S_<sub>2</sub>, ..., _S_<sub>k</sub> ∈ _T_ such that __v__<sub>i</sub> ∈ _S_<sub>i</sub> for every _i_ = 1, 2, ..., _k_}@}. As {@{_T_ is totally ordered}@}, {@{one of the sets _S_<sub>1</sub>, _S_<sub>2</sub>, ..., _S_<sub>k</sub> must contain the others}@}, so {@{there is some set _S_<sub>i</sub> that contains all of __v__<sub>1</sub>, __v__<sub>2</sub>, ..., __v__<sub>k</sub>}@}. This tells us {@{there is a linearly dependent set of vectors in _S_<sub>i</sub>}@}, {@{contradicting that _S_<sub>i</sub> is linearly independent \(because it is a member of _P_\)}@}. <!--SR:!2026-03-12,348,350!2026-04-26,366,310!2026-03-12,348,350!2028-01-28,870,338!2026-12-09,491,310!2030-06-05,1572,370!2026-03-05,342,350!2027-02-11,596,330!2028-03-07,827,330!2026-08-12,447,318-->

{@{The hypothesis of Zorn's lemma}@} has been checked, and thus {@{there is a maximal element in _P_}@}, in other words {@{a maximal linearly independent subset _B_ of _V_}@}. <!--SR:!2028-02-12,879,338!2029-05-22,1264,358!2026-03-09,346,350-->

Finally, we show that {@{_B_ is indeed a basis of _V_}@}. It {@{suffices to show that _B_ is a [spanning set](linear%20span.md) of _V_}@}. Suppose {@{for the sake of contradiction that _B_ is not spanning}@}. Then {@{there exists some __v__ ∈ _V_ not covered by the span of _B_}@}. This says that {@{_B_ ∪ {__v__} is a linearly independent subset of _V_ that is larger than _B_}@}, contradicting {@{the maximality of _B_}@}. Therefore, {@{_B_ is a spanning set of _V_, and thus, a basis of _V_}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-07,575,330!2027-05-28,665,330!2026-03-03,341,350!2026-03-15,351,350!2026-06-29,403,310!2030-02-15,1484,370!2029-01-05,1078,350-->

Let {@{_P_ be the set consisting of all _proper_ [ideals](ideal%20(ring%20theory).md) in _R_}@} \(that is, {@{all ideals in _R_ except _R_ itself}@}\).

{@{A sketch of the proof of Zorn's lemma}@} follows, assuming {@{the [axiom of choice](axiom%20of%20choice.md)}@}. Suppose {@{the lemma is false}@}. Then {@{there exists a partially ordered set, or poset, _P_}@} such that {@{every totally ordered subset has an upper bound, and that for every element in _P_ there is another element bigger than it}@}. For {@{every totally ordered subset _T_ we may then define a bigger element _b_\(_T_\)}@}, because {@{_T_ has an upper bound, and that upper bound has a bigger element}@}. To {@{actually define the [function](function%20(mathematics).md) _b_}@}, we need to {@{employ the axiom of choice}@} \(explicitly: let {@{$B(T)=\{b\in P:\forall t\in T,b\geq t\}$, that is, the set of upper bounds for _T_}@}. {@{The axiom of choice}@} {@{furnishes $b:b(T)\in B(T)$}@}\). \(annotation: {@{Defining the function _b_\(_T_\)}@} requires {@{picking an element from _B_\(_T_\) for each _T_}@}, and {@{the set of _T_ may be arbitrarily large}@}.\) <!--SR:!2030-03-03,1500,370!2029-09-18,1346,358!2030-06-18,1582,370!2026-03-06,343,350!2027-01-26,582,330!2027-01-09,563,318!2027-04-21,644,330!2028-05-10,956,350!2026-03-07,344,350!2030-07-30,1617,370!2027-06-04,640,330!2028-02-14,732,417!2028-02-21,738,417!2028-03-03,747,417!2028-02-22,738,417-->

The above proof can be formulated {@{without explicitly referring to ordinals}@} by {@{considering the initial segments {_a_<sub>_v_</sub> : _v_ \< _w_} as subsets of _P_}@}.

\(Note that, strictly speaking, {@{\(1\) is redundant since \(2\) implies the empty set is in $F$ (annotation: the union of no sets is an empty set)}@}.\) Note {@{the above is a weak form of Zorn's lemma}@} since Zorn's lemma says in particular that {@{any set of subsets satisfying the above \(1\) and \(2\) has a maximal element \(\(3\) is not needed\)}@}. The point is that, {@{conversely, Zorn's lemma follows from this weak form}@}.<sup>[\[15\]](#^ref-15)</sup> Indeed, let {@{$F$ be the set of all chains in $P$}@}. Then {@{it satisfies all of the above properties \(it is nonempty since the empty subset is a chain\)}@}. Thus, by {@{the above weak form}@}, we {@{find a maximal element $C$ in $F$; i.e., a maximal chain in $P$}@}. By {@{the hypothesis of Zorn's lemma}@}, {@{$C$ has an upper bound $x$ in $P$}@}. Then {@{this $x$ is a maximal element}@} since {@{if $y\geq x$, then ${\widetilde {C} }=C\cup \{y\}$ is larger than or equal to $C$ and so ${\widetilde {C} }=C$.

The proof of the weak form is given in {@{[Hausdorff maximal principle\#Proof](Hausdorff%20maximal%20principle.md#proof)}@}.

For that end, consider {@{the set <p> $P=\{f:X'\to U\mid X'\subseteq X,f(S)\in S\}$}@}. (annotation: In other words, it is {@{the set of all functions matching the above criteria but the domain may be smaller (a subset of $X$)}@}.) <p> It is {@{partially ordered by extension}@}; i.e., {@{$f\leq g$ if and only if $f$ is the restriction of $g$}@}.

The function $f$ is {@{also an element of $P$ and is a common extension of all $f_{i}$<!-- LaTeX separator -->'s}@}. Thus, we have shown that {@{each chain in $P$ has an upper bound in $P$}@}.

### analogs under weakenings of the axiom of choice

- See also: [Axiom of dependent choice](axiom%20of%20dependent%20choice.md)

{@{A weakened form of Zorn's lemma}@} can be {@{proven from ZF + DC \(Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice replaced by the [axiom of dependent choice](axiom%20of%20dependent%20choice.md)\)}@}. Zorn's lemma can be {@{expressed straightforwardly}@} by observing that {@{the set having no maximal element}@} would be equivalent to stating that {@{the set's ordering relation would be entire}@} \(annotation: {@{each element $x$ in the set}@} has {@{an another element $y$ in the same set larger than $x$}@}\), which would allow us to apply {@{the axiom of dependent choice to construct a countable chain}@}. As a result, {@{any partially ordered set with exclusively finite chains}@} must have {@{a maximal element}@}.<sup>[\[28\]](#^ref-28)</sup> <!--SR:!2026-03-11,348,350!2028-04-19,856,290!2026-03-04,341,350!2028-01-08,751,290!2028-06-28,996,350!2027-07-12,697,330!2026-06-16,131,403!2026-05-10,95,383!2026-06-08,124,403!2026-06-25,139,403-->
