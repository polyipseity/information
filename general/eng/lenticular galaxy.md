# lenticular galaxy

A {@{__lenticular galaxy__}@} (denoted {@{S0}@}) is {@{a [type of galaxy](galaxy%20morphological%20classification.md) intermediate between an [elliptical](elliptical%20galaxy.md) (denoted E) and a [spiral galaxy](spiral%20galaxy.md) in [galaxy morphological classification](galaxy%20morphological%20classification.md) schemes}@}. It contains {@{a large-scale disc but does not have large-scale spiral arms}@}. Lenticular galaxies are {@{[disc galaxies](disc%20galaxy.md) that have used up or lost most of their [interstellar matter](interstellar%20medium.md) and therefore have very little ongoing [star formation](star%20formation.md)}@}. They may, however, {@{retain significant dust in their disks}@}. As a result, they consist {@{mainly of aging stars (like elliptical galaxies)}@}. Despite the morphological differences, {@{lenticular and elliptical galaxies share common properties like spectral features and scaling relations}@}. Both can be considered {@{early-type galaxies that are passively evolving, at least in the local part of the [universe](universe.md)}@}. Connecting the E galaxies with the S0 galaxies are {@{the ES galaxies with intermediate-scale discs}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-26,729,330!2028-01-12,970,350!2026-10-19,560,310!2027-12-18,955,350!2028-04-27,927,270!2028-08-23,1150,350!2026-06-11,471,310!2028-11-29,1038,290!2028-07-15,977,270!2028-12-08,1047,290-->
