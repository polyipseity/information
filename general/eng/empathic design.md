# empathic design

## characteristics

Empathy is the foundation of {@{a human-centered design process}@}. <!--SR:!2028-03-16,1093,350-->

### difference from sympathy

Empathy is {@{to understand or feel another person from their frame of perspective, i.e. placing one in others' shoes}@}, while sympathy is {@{simply expressing understanding or care for others' feeling}@}. In terms of effect, empathy can drive {@{connections while sympathy can do the opposite}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-03,729,290!2028-07-31,1134,310!2027-03-17,781,330-->

For example, a sympathetic person seeing a homeless person might {@{feel bad, donate some money, and go away}@}, while an empathic person might {@{spend time and attempt to connect with the person}@}. <!--SR:!2029-01-05,1324,350!2027-11-23,966,310-->

## process

In an empathic design process, we need to {@{observe, immerse, engage, and understand}@}. <!--SR:!2031-08-25,2029,330-->

Observe {@{views users and their behavior in the context of their lives}@}. <!--SR:!2028-06-27,1120,310-->

Immerse is {@{experiencing in your users' shoes}@}. <!--SR:!2028-03-30,1105,350-->

Engage is {@{interacting and interviewing users}@}. When {@{choosing people to interview}@}, {@{apart from normal users}@}, also {@{choose extreme users}@}, as they can {@{magnify the needs and potential solutions}@}. For example, for {@{a knife handle}@}, {@{apart from housewives and cooks}@}, also {@{interview people having problems holding a knife and master chefs}@}. There are {@{several methods to interview}@}, such as {@{interview or ethnographic research, focus group}@}, {@{survey or questionnaire, and other new methods like social media}@}. Before the interview, {@{prepare thoroughly}@}, such as {@{deciding on a goal, research user background, and prepare and prioritize questions}@}. During interviews, one can use {@{[5W1H](Five%20Ws.md): when, where, who, what, why, how}@}; and {@{draw a table}@}. After interviewing, one can {@{write the findings on sticky notes and paste it onto the [empathy map](empathy%20map.md)}@}. Additionally, we can add {@{2 new sections, pains and gains, to the map}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-10,522,310!2026-12-06,648,310!2026-02-20,174,270!2029-02-09,1179,270!2026-05-28,444,250!2027-11-03,989,350!2026-05-21,556,310!2030-05-11,1557,290!2026-12-21,378,371!2027-02-05,415,371!2027-01-23,403,371!2027-01-26,406,371!2027-01-25,405,371!2027-01-01,387,371!2026-12-25,381,371!2027-01-02,388,371!2027-01-24,404,371-->

Understand is {@{understanding the _real_ problems the users have}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-26,491,310-->
