# empathic design

## characteristics

Empathy is the foundation of {@{a human-centered design process}@}. <!--SR:!2028-03-16,1093,350-->

### difference from sympathy

Empathy is {@{to understand or feel another person from their frame of perspective, i.e. placing one in others' shoes}@}, while sympathy is {@{simply expressing understanding or care for others' feeling}@}. In terms of effect, empathy can drive {@{connections while sympathy can do the opposite}@}. <!--SR:!2027-03-03,729,290!2025-06-23,280,290!2027-03-17,781,330-->

For example, a sympathetic person seeing a homeless person might {@{feel bad, donate some money, and go away}@}, while an empathic person might {@{spend time and attempt to connect with the person}@}. <!--SR:!2029-01-05,1324,350!2027-11-23,966,310-->

## process

In an empathic design process, we need to {@{observe, immerse, engage, and understand}@}. <!--SR:!2026-01-31,473,310-->

Observe {@{views users and their behavior in the context of their lives}@}. <!--SR:!2028-06-27,1120,310-->

Immerse is {@{experiencing in your users' shoes}@}. <!--SR:!2028-03-30,1105,350-->

Engage is {@{interacting and interviewing users}@}. When choosing people to interview, {@{apart from normal users, also choose extreme users, as they can magnify the needs and potential solutions}@}. For example, for a knife handle, {@{apart from housewives and cooks, also interview people having problems holding a knife and master chefs}@}. There are several methods to interview, such as {@{interview or ethnographic research, focus group, survey or questionnaire, and other new methods like social media}@}. Before the interview, {@{prepare thoroughly, such as deciding on a goal, research user background, and prepare and prioritize questions}@}. During interviews, one can use {@{[5W1H](Five%20Ws.md): when, where, who, what, why, how; and draw a table}@}. After interviewing, one can {@{write the findings on sticky notes and paste it onto the [empathy map](empathy%20map.md)}@}. Additionally, we can add {@{2 new sections, pains and gains, to the map}@}. <!--SR:!2026-06-10,522,310!2026-12-06,648,310!2025-08-30,342,290!2025-11-18,336,250!2026-05-28,444,250!2027-11-03,989,350!2026-05-21,556,310!2026-02-04,413,270-->

Understand is {@{understanding the _real_ problems the users have}@}. <!--SR:!2026-02-26,491,310-->
