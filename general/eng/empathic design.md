# empathic design

## characteristics

Empathy is the foundation of {@{a human-centered design process}@}.

### difference from sympathy

Empathy is {@{to understand or feel another person from their frame of perspective, i.e. placing one in others' shoes}@}, while sympathy is {@{simply expressing understanding or care for others' feeling}@}. In terms of effect, empathy can drive {@{connections while sympathy can do the opposite}@}.

For example, a sympathetic person seeing a homeless person might {@{feel bad, donate some money, and go away}@}, while an empathic person might {@{spend time and attempt to connect with the person}@}.

## process

In an empathic design process, we need to {@{observe, immerse, engage, and understand}@}.

Observe {@{views users and their behavior in the context of their lives}@}.

Immerse is {@{experiencing in your users' shoes}@}.

Engage is {@{interacting and interviewing users}@}. When {@{choosing people to interview}@}, {@{apart from normal users}@}, also {@{choose extreme users}@}, as they can {@{magnify the needs and potential solutions}@}. For example, for {@{a knife handle}@}, {@{apart from housewives and cooks}@}, also {@{interview people having problems holding a knife and master chefs}@}. There are {@{several methods to interview}@}, such as {@{interview or ethnographic research, focus group}@}, {@{survey or questionnaire, and other new methods like social media}@}. Before the interview, {@{prepare thoroughly}@}, such as {@{deciding on a goal, research user background, and prepare and prioritize questions}@}. During interviews, one can use {@{[5W1H](Five%20Ws.md): when, where, who, what, why, how}@}; and {@{draw a table}@}. After interviewing, one can {@{write the findings on sticky notes and paste it onto the [empathy map](empathy%20map.md)}@}. Additionally, we can add {@{2 new sections, pains and gains, to the map}@}.

Understand is {@{understanding the _real_ problems the users have}@}.
