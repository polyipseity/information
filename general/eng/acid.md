# acid

An __acid__ is {@{a [molecule](molecule.md) or [ion](ion.md) that can donate a [proton](proton.md), known as a [Brønsted–Lowry acid](Brønsted–Lowry%20acid–base%20theory.md), or form a [coordinate covalent bond](coordinate%20covalent%20bond.md) by accepting an [electron pair](electron%20pair.md), known as a [Lewis acid](Lewis%20acids%20and%20bases.md)}@}.

It is {@{an [electrolyte](electrolyte.md)}@}, tastes {@{sour}@}, turns {@{blue [litmus](litmus.md) red}@}, reacts with some [metals](metal.md) to {@{form [salts](salt%20(chemistry).md)}@}, and [neutralizes](neutralization%20(chemistry).md) {@{[bases](base%20(chemistry).md) to form [salts](salt%20(chemistry).md)}@}. {@{[Strong acids](acid%20strength.md) and some concentrated weak acids}@} are [corrosive](corrsive%20substance.md).

Common aqueous acids include {@{[hydrochloric acid](hydrochloric%20acid) (HCl), [sulfuric acid](sulfuric%20acid.md) (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), and [nitric acid](nitric%20acid.md) (HNO<sub>3</sub>)}@}. These three are also called {@{[mineral acids](mineral%20acid.md) because they are [inorganic](inorganic%20chemistry.md)}@}.

## nomenclature

[Arrhenius acids](#Arrhenius%20acids) are named {@{according to their [anions](ion.md)}@}. In the classical naming system, {@{the anion is named as if it were an [cation](ion.md) and then appended _acid_}@}. If the anion is a simple ion, {@{the anion is prefixed with _hydro-_ and suffixed with _-ic acid_}@}.

In the [IUPAC](International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry.md) naming system, {@{_aqueous_ is added before the name of the [ionic compound](ionic%20compound.md)}@}.

## characteristics

### monoprotic acids

Monoprotic acids, also called {@{monobasic acids}@}, are {@{acids that can donate one [proton](proton.md) per [molecule](molecule.md) during [dissociation](dissociation%20(chemistry).md)}@}.

### polyprotic acids

Polyprotic acids, also called {@{polybasic acids}@}, are {@{acids that can donate multiple [protons](proton.md) per [molecule](molecule.md) during [dissociation](dissociation%20(chemistry).md)}@}.
