# electromagnetic radiation

__Electromagnetic radiation__ (__EMR__) consists of {@{[waves](wave.md) of the [electromagnetic field](electromagnetic%20field.md)}@}. It {@{propagates through [space](space.md) and carry [momentum](momentum.md) and electromagnetic [radiant energy](radiant%20energy.md)}@}. In {@{[quantum mechanics](quantum%20mechanics.md)}@}, EMR is viewed as {@{consisting of [photons](photon.md) (also see [wave–particle duality](wave–particle%20duality.md))}@}.

## properties

### wave model

{@{The [electric field](electric%20field.md) and the [magnetic field](magnetic%20field.md)}@} in the electromagnetic radiation {@{oscillates perpendicularly in sync}@}.

{@{[Electric charges](electric%20charge.md) have an [oscillating](oscillation.md) [force](force.md) applied}@} by the electric field in the radiation.

> - [electric charges](electric%20charge.md) [oscillate](oscillation.md) due to electromagnetic radiation: It is important to recognize that the oscillation {@{refers to the [force](force.md) but not the [position](position%20(geometry).md) of the [electric charge](electric%20charge.md)}@}. That is, the electric charge {@{does not necessarily oscillate in place}@}. If one starts a [thought experiment](thought%20experiment.md), initially with {@{a free [electron](electron.md) at rest and a beam of electromagnetic radiation passes through it no matter where it goes}@}. One would find the free electron {@{oscillate up and down about a constantly drifting point by}@} setting {@{the initial phase of the electromagnetic radiation}@} such that it {@{applies zero [electrostatic force](Coulomb's%20law.md) initially}@}. It is also possible to make the free electron {@{oscillate up and down about a fixed point}@} by setting {@{the initial phase of the electromagnetic radiation}@} such that it {@{applies maximum electrostatic force initially}@}. This apparent paradox can be resolved by realizing {@{there are no free electrons in practice, bounded by either [atoms](atom.md), [molecules](molecule.md), or external [electromagnetic fields](electromagnetic%20field.md), thus prohibiting [translatory motion](translation%20(geometry).md)}@}.

## interactions

### photoelectric effect

{@{Electromagnetic radiation striking a material causes [electrons](electron.md) to be emitted.}@} This is known as the {@{[photoelectric effect](photoelectric%20effect.md)}@}.
