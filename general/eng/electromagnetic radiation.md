# electromagnetic radiation

__Electromagnetic radiation__ (__EMR__) consists of {@{[waves](wave.md) of the [electromagnetic field](electromagnetic%20field.md)}@}.  It {@{propagates through [space](space.md) and carry [momentum](momentum.md) and electromagnetic [radiant energy](radiant%20energy.md)}@}. In {@{[quantum mechanics](quantum%20mechanics.md)}@}, EMR is viewed as {@{consisting of [photons](photon.md) (also see [wave–particle duality](wave–particle%20duality.md))}@}. <!--SR:!2031-11-02,2352,290!2028-08-28,1156,346!2028-09-11,1156,346!2025-11-02,365,346-->

## properties

### wave model

{@{The [electric field](electric%20field.md) and the [magnetic field](magnetic%20field.md)}@} in the electromagnetic radiation {@{oscillates perpendicularly in sync}@}. <!--SR:!2031-11-23,2368,290!2032-02-10,2420,290-->

{@{[Electric charges](electric%20charge.md) have an [oscillating](oscillation.md) [force](force.md) applied}@} by the electric field in the radiation. <!--SR:!2029-01-15,1304,230-->

> - [electric charges](electric%20charge.md) [oscillate](oscillation.md) due to electromagnetic radiation: It is important to recognize that the oscillation {@{refers to the [force](force.md) but not the [position](position%20(geometry).md) of the [electric charge](electric%20charge.md)}@}. That is, the electric charge {@{does not necessarily oscillate in place}@}. If one starts a [thought experiment](thought%20experiment.md), initially with {@{a free [electron](electron.md) at rest and a beam of electromagnetic radiation passes through it no matter where it goes}@}. One would find the free electron {@{oscillate up and down about a constantly drifting point by setting the initial phase of the electromagnetic radiation such that it applies zero [electrostatic force](Coulomb's%20law.md) initially}@}. It is also possible to make the free electron {@{oscillate up and down about a fixed point by setting the initial phase of the electromagnetic radiation such that it applies maximum electrostatic force initially}@}. This apparent paradox can be resolved by realizing {@{there are no free electrons in practice, bounded by either [atoms](atom.md), [molecules](molecule.md), or external [electromagnetic fields](electromagnetic%20field.md), thus prohibiting [translatory motion](translation%20(geometry).md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-06-30,942,335!2027-01-18,823,335!2026-05-02,534,275!2029-02-21,1315,295!2026-03-01,525,315!2026-10-26,609,255-->

## interactions

### photoelectric effect

{@{Electromagnetic radiation striking a material causes [electrons](electron.md) to be emitted.}@} This is known as the {@{[photoelectric effect](photoelectric%20effect.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2027-09-10,987,230!2032-01-18,2532,330-->
