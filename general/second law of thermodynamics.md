The __second law of thermodynamics__ states that {{in an [isolated system](isolated%20system.md) (not [closed system](closed%20system.md)), [entropy](entropy.md) always increases for [irreversible process](irreversible%20process.md) and remains unchanged for [reversible processes](reversible%20process%20(thermodynamics).md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-01-01,14,290-->
