# inner product space

## some examples

### Hilbert space

- see: [Hilbert space](Hilbert%20space.md)

[Hilbert spaces](Hilbert%20space.md) are {{inner product spaces with an [induced](subspace%20topology.md) [distance function](metric%20space.md) for which the space is a [complete metric space](complete%20metric%20space.md)}}. However, for simplicity, inner product spaces are often introduced {{without regards to the completeness of the induced metric space}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-27,14,290!2024-07-26,13,290-->

An example of an inner product space which {{induces an incomplete metric}} is {{the space $C([a, b])$ of continuous complex-valued functions on the interval $[a, b]$}}. The inner product of two functions $f$ and $g$ in this space is often stated as {{$$\langle f, g \rangle = \int_a^b \! f(t) \overline{g(t)} \,\mathrm{d}t$$}}. This space is not complete. Consider for example, on the interval $[-1, 1]$ ($C([-1, 1])$) the sequence of continuous "step" functions, $\set{f_k}_k$, defined by {{$$f_k(t) = \begin{cases} 0 & t \in [-1, 0] \\ kt & t \in (0, 1 / k) \\ 1 & t \in [1 / k, 1] \end{cases}$$}}. Graphically, the graph a function in the sequence can be described as {{constant $0$ from $-1$ to $0$, then linearly increasing to $1$ from $0$ to $1 / k$, then constant $1$ from $1 / k$ to $1$; as $k$ increases, the function [converges pointwise](pointwise%20convergence.md) to the [Heaviside step function](Heaviside%20step%20function.md) (with $f(0) = 0$)}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-26,13,290!2024-07-26,13,290!2024-07-27,14,290!2024-07-26,13,290!2024-07-26,13,290-->

Now consider the norm, defined as {{$$\lVert f \rVert = \sqrt{\langle f, f \rangle}$$}}, and the distance function in terms of the norm, defined as {{$$d(f, g) = \lVert f - g \rVert = \sqrt{\langle f - g, f - g \rangle}$$}}. For any error $\varepsilon > 0$, we can find {{a large enough number $N$ such that the "distance" between any two functions after the $N$-th function is smaller than the error $\varepsilon$}}. Loosely, the distance function roughly describes {{how different two functions are}}, and the sequence of functions are {{increasingly similar to all functions after it in the sequence (compare $f_1 - f_2$ and $f_{100} - f_{101}$)}}, so the maximum "distance" between {{any two functions after the $N$-th function can be controlled by setting a large enough $N$}}. So the above sequence of function is {{a [Cauchy sequence](Cauchy%20sequence.md) for the [metric space](metric%20space.md) defined by $C([-1, 1])$ and the distance function}}, yet the sequence {{[converges pointwise](pointwise%20convergence.md) to the [Heaviside step function](Heaviside%20step%20function.md), which is [discontinuous](continuous%20function.md) and does not belong to $C([-1, 1])$}}, making the metric space incomplete. <!--SR:!2024-07-27,14,290!2024-07-22,9,270!2024-07-26,13,290!2024-07-27,14,290!2024-07-26,13,290!2024-07-26,13,290!2024-07-27,14,290!2024-07-26,13,290-->
