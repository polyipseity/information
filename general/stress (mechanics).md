# stress

In [continuum mechanics](continnum%20mechanics.md), __stress__ is {{a [physical quantity](physical%20quantity.md) describing [forces](force.md) present during [deformation](deformation%20(physics).md)}}.

## simple types

### uniaxial normal

Assume the system is {{in equilibrium and not changing with time, and the weight can be neglected}}. The stress {{$\sigma$}} for an {{uniform straight rod across any horizontal cross section}} can be represented by {{a single number $\sigma$}}, calculated with {{the normal force $F$ divided by the cross sectional area $A$ it acts on}}: {{$$\sigma = \frac F A$$}}

Stress has units {{N/m<sup>2</sup>}}.
