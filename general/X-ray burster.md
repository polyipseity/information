# X-ray burster

__X-ray bursters__ are {{one class of [X-ray binary stars](x-ray%20binary.md) exhibiting __X-ray bursts__}}, {{periodic and rapid increases in [luminosity](luminosity.md) (typically a factor of 10 or greater) that peak in the [X-ray](x-ray.md) region of the [electromagnetic spectrum](electromagnetic%20spectrum.md)}}. These astrophysical systems are {{composed of an [accreting](accretion%20(astrophysics).md) [neutron star](neutron%20star.md) and a [main sequence](main%20sequence.md) companion 'donor' star}}. There are {{two types of X-ray bursts, designated I and II}}. Type I bursts are {{caused by thermonuclear runaway, while type II arise from the release of gravitational (potential) energy liberated through accretion}}. For type I (thermonuclear) bursts, {{the mass transferred from the donor star accumulates on the surface of the neutron star until it ignites and fuses in a burst, producing X-rays}}. The behaviour of X-ray bursters is similar to {{the behaviour of recurrent [novae](nova.md)}}. In the latter case {{the compact object is a [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md) that accretes [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) that finally undergoes explosive burning}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-11,50,310!2024-10-01,40,290!2024-10-20,58,310!2024-10-26,63,310!2024-09-12,25,250!2024-09-13,28,250!2024-08-25,17,290!2024-10-25,62,310-->
