# irregular galaxy

An __irregular galaxy__ is {@{a [galaxy](galaxy.md) that does not have a distinct regular shape, unlike a [spiral](spiral%20galaxy.md) or an [elliptical galaxy](elliptical%20galaxy.md)}@}. Irregular galaxies do not {@{fall into any of the regular classes of the [Hubble sequence](Hubble%20sequence.md)}@}, and they are often {@{chaotic in appearance, with neither a [nuclear bulge](galactic%20bulge.md) nor any trace of [spiral arm](spiral%20arm.md) structure}@}.
