# solar neutrino problem

The __solar neutrino problem__ concerned {{a large discrepancy between the flux of [solar neutrinos](solar%20neutrino.md) as predicted from the [Sun](Sun.md)'s [luminosity](luminosity.md) and as measured directly}}. The discrepancy was {{first observed in the mid-1960s and was resolved around 2002}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-09,13,290!2024-08-11,15,290-->

When [neutrino detectors](neutrino%20detector.md) became {{sensitive enough to measure the flow of [electron neutrinos](electron%20neutrino.md) from the [Sun](Sun.md)}}, the number detected was {{much lower than predicted. In various experiments, the number deficit was between one half and two thirds}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-13,17,290!2024-08-12,16,290-->

## resolution

- see: [Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect](Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein%20effect.md), [neutrino oscillation](neutrino%20oscillation.md)

The solar neutrino problem was resolved with {{an improved understanding of the properties of neutrinos. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, there are three flavors of neutrinos: [_electron neutrinos_](electron%20neutrino.md), [_muon neutrinos_](muon%20neutrino.md), and [_tau neutrinos_](tau%20neutrino.md)}}. Electron neutrinos are {{the ones produced in the Sun and the ones detected by the above-mentioned experiments, in particular the chlorine-detector Homestake Mine experiment}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-12,16,290!2024-08-07,11,270-->

Strong evidence for {{[neutrino oscillation](neutrino%20oscillation.md) came in 1998}} from the [Super-Kamiokande](Super-Kamiokande.md) collaboration in Japan. <!--SR:!2024-08-02,6,250-->
