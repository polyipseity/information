# stretch rule

In [classical mechanics](classical%20mechanics.md), the __stretch rule__, also known as {{__[Routh](Edward%20Routh.md)'s rule__}}, states that {{the [moment of inertia](moment%20of%20inertia.md) of an object does not change if its masses are moved or stretched in a direction parallel to the rotation axis}}. <!--SR:!2024-01-09,6,270!2024-01-04,14,290-->
