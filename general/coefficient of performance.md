# coefficient of performance

## equation

> __coefficient of performance__
>
> {{$$\mathrm{COP} = \frac{\lvert Q \rvert}W$$}}
>
> - where
>     - {{$Q$ is the useful [heat](heat.md) supplied to (if heating) or removed by (if cooling) the system, and $W$ is the net [work](work%20(physics).md) supplied to the system}} <!--SR:!2024-01-06,13,290!2024-01-07,14,290-->

> __coefficient of performance, separate__
