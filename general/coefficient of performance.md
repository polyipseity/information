# coefficient of performance

## equation

> __coefficient of performance__
>
> {{$$\mathrm{COP} = \frac{\lvert Q \rvert}W$$}}
>
> - where
>     - {{$Q$ is the useful [heat](heat.md) supplied to (if heating) or removed by (if cooling) the system, and $W$ is the net [work](work%20(physics).md) supplied to the system}}

> __coefficient of performance, separate__
>
> {{$$\begin{aligned} \mathrm{COP}_\mathrm{cooling} & = \frac{\lvert Q_C \rvert}W = \frac{Q_C}W \\ \mathrm{COP}_\mathrm{heating} & = \frac{\lvert Q_H \rvert}W = \frac{Q_C + W}W = \mathrm{COP}_\mathrm{cooling} + 1 \end{aligned}$$}}
>
> - where
>     - {{$Q_C$ and $Q_H$ are respectively [heat](heat.md) absorbed by and given off from the system, and $W$ is the net [work](work%20(physics).md) supplied to the system}}
