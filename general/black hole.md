# black hole

A __black hole__ is {{a region of [spacetime](spacetime.md) where [gravity](gravity.md) is so strong that nothing, not even [light](light.md) and other [electromagnetic waves](electromagnetic%20radiation.md), is capable of possessing enough energy to escape it}}. [Einstein](Albert%20Einstein.md)'s {{theory of [general relativity](general%20relativity.md)}} predicts that {{a sufficiently compact [mass](mass.md) can deform spacetime to form a black hole}}. {{The [boundary](boundary%20(topology).md) of no escape}} is called {{the [event horizon](event%20horizon.md)}}. A black hole has {{a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it}}, but it has {{no locally detectable features according to general relativity}}. In many ways, a black hole acts like {{an ideal [black body](black%20body.md), as it reflects no light}}. {{[Quantum field theory in curved spacetime](quantum%20field%20theory%20in%20curved%20spacetime.md)}} predicts that {{event horizons emit [Hawking radiation](hawking%20radiation.md), with [the same spectrum](thermal%20radiation.md) as a black body of a [temperature](temperature.md) inversely proportional to its mass}}. This temperature is {{of the order of billionths of a [kelvin](Kelvin.md) for [stellar black holes](stellar%20black%20hole.md), making it essentially impossible to observe directly}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-18,57,310!2024-08-25,17,290!2024-09-18,29,270!2024-08-24,16,290!2024-09-26,35,290!2024-10-20,59,310!2024-10-14,53,310!2024-09-15,28,270!2024-09-28,40,290!2024-10-05,43,290!2024-10-06,48,290-->
