## high-rise buildings

Buildings can be {{categorized by height}}: {{single-storey, multi-storey with height less than 24 m, high-rise with height more than 24 m but less than 100 m, tall, and supertall}}.

The structural system of a building only {{consists of members designed to carry loads}}, and all others are {{non-structural}}.

The structural system of a high-rise building should support {{vertical loads such as gravity and foundation settlement, and also lateral loads such as earthquake, wind}}. The latter, {{lateral loads, are especially important for tall buildings}}. Otherwise, tall buildings may {{slide (horizontal translation) or overturn (rotation about the base)}}. Generally the higher up, {{the larger the load}}.

Hence, foundation-wise, low-rise buildings are {{supported by shallow foundations (footings)}}, while high-rise buildings are {{supported by deep foundations (pipes), which may even reach the bedrock}}.

The structural system affects {{the load distribution}}. For example, a {{structural steel undergoing overturning due to wind}} would experience {{tension at the wind-facing side and compression on the other side}}. A {{reinforced concrete (concrete with steel bars)}} would experience the same thing, but {{steel bars bear most of the tension while concrete bears most of the compression and the heavy vertical loading}}.

We can {{quantify}} overturning. The {{lateral stiffness}} of a building is defined as {{the force divided by the horizontal displacement at the building top, and has a unit of kN/mm}}, somewhat similar to {{[elastic modulus](elastic%20modulus.md)}}. The aim is to {{increase the lateral stiffness, which involves making the building stiff and strong}}.

### classification

For high-rise buildings, the structural system can be broadly categorized into {{exterior and interior structures}}.

#### interior structures

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
items = R"""
[braced frame](braced%20frame.md)
[hinged frame](hinged%20frame.md)
[outrigger](#outrigger)
[rigid frame](rigid%20frame.md)
[shear-walled frame](#sheared-walled%20frame): [rigid frame](rigid%20frame.md) + [shear wall](shear%20wall.md)
""".strip().splitlines()
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("ed23", "ab92"),
  items,
)
```

The following interior structures are possible.

##### outrigger

- see [outrigger](outrigger.md)

Intuitively, if a high-rise building is {{a skier}}, then {{the building core is the human body, the outriggers are the arms, and the building exterior are the ski poles}}.

Outriggers can {{reduce the overturning moment in the core by transferring some moment to columns outside the core}}.

For example, outriggers are used in {{the [International Commerce Center](International%20Commerce%20Center.md)}}. The building has {{4 outriggers in 4 separate floors}}. In each outrigger, {{8 outriggers connect the core to the mega columns of the exterior structure, forming a hash (#) shape}}.

#### exterior structures

The following exterior structures are possible.

```Python
# pytextgen generate data
items = R"""
[buttress](buttress.md)
[diagrid](diagrid.md)
[exoskeleton](exoskeleton.md)
[space truss](space%20frame.md)
[superframe](superframe.md)
[tube](tube%20(structure).md)
""".strip().splitlines()
return await memorize_seq(
  __env__.cwf_sects("ffe2", "7123"),
  items,
)
```
