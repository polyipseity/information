# emission nebula

An __emission nebula__ is {{a [nebula](nebula.md) formed of ionized gases that emit light of various wavelengths}}. The most common source of [ionization](ionization.md) is {{high-energy [ultraviolet](ultraviolet.md) [photons](photon.md) emitted from a nearby hot [star](star.md)}}. Among the several different types of emission nebulae are {{[H II regions](H%20II%20region.md), in which star formation is taking place and young, massive stars are the source of the ionizing photons}}; and {{[planetary nebulae](planetary%20nebula.md), in which a dying star has thrown off its outer layers, with the exposed hot core then ionizing them}}.

## general information

The nebula's color depends on {{its chemical composition and degree of ionization}}. Due to {{the prevalence of [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) in interstellar gas, and its relatively low energy of ionization}}, many emission nebulae {{appear red due to strong emissions of the [Balmer series](Balmer%20series.md)}}. If more [energy](energy.md) is available, {{other elements will be ionized, and green and blue nebulae become possible}}. By examining the [spectra](astronomical%20spectroscopy.md#stellar%20spectrum) of nebulae, astronomers {{infer their chemical content}}. Most emission nebulae are {{about 90% hydrogen, with the remaining [helium](helium.md), [oxygen](oxygen.md), [nitrogen](nitrogen.md), and other elements}}.
