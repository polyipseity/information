# emission nebula

An __emission nebula__ is {{a [nebula](nebula.md) formed of ionized gases that emit light of various wavelengths}}. The most common source of [ionization](ionization.md) is {{high-energy [ultraviolet](ultraviolet.md) [photons](photon.md) emitted from a nearby hot [star](star.md)}}. Among the several different types of emission nebulae are {{[H II regions](H%20II%20region.md), in which star formation is taking place and young, massive stars are the source of the ionizing photons}}; and {{[planetary nebulae](planetary%20nebula.md), in which a dying star has thrown off its outer layers, with the exposed hot core then ionizing them}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-17,132,290!2024-10-24,66,310!2024-10-26,59,270!2024-10-27,68,310-->

## general information

The nebula's color depends on {{its chemical composition and degree of ionization}}. Due to {{the prevalence of [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) in interstellar gas, and its relatively low energy of ionization}}, many emission nebulae {{appear red due to strong emissions of the [Balmer series](Balmer%20series.md)}}. If more [energy](energy.md) is available, {{other elements will be ionized, and green and blue nebulae become possible}}. By examining the [spectra](astronomical%20spectroscopy.md#stellar%20spectrum) of nebulae, astronomers {{infer their chemical content}}. Most emission nebulae are {{about 90% hydrogen, with the remaining [helium](helium.md), [oxygen](oxygen.md), [nitrogen](nitrogen.md), and other elements}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,164,310!2025-03-19,155,270!2024-12-15,97,290!2025-03-14,168,310!2025-06-30,256,330!2025-01-27,127,290-->
