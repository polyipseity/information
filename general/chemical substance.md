# chemical substance

A __chemical substance__ is {{a matter with characteristic properties and constant [chemical composition](chemical%20composition.md)}}. It can either be {{a [chemical element](#chemical%20element) or a [chemical compound](#chemical%20compound)}}.<sup>[1](#^note-1)</sup> It is pure, {{while impure ones are [mixtures](mixture.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-01-05,156,230!2024-09-07,382,290!2024-05-25,328,330-->
