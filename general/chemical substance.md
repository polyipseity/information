# chemical substance

A __chemical substance__ is {{a matter with characteristic properties and constant [chemical composition](chemical%20composition.md)}}. It can either be {{a [chemical element](#chemical%20element) or a [chemical compound](#chemical%20compound)}}.<sup>[1](#^note-1)</sup> It is pure, {{while impure ones are [mixtures](mixture.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-01-05,156,230!2024-09-07,382,290!2024-05-25,328,330-->

## properties

Compare with [mixture ยง properties](mixture.md#properties).

- composition: {{fixed, definite, constant}}
- formation: {{[chemical reaction](chemical%20reaction.md) occurs}}
- properties: {{different from its constituents}}
- separation: {{separable by chemical methods but not physical methods}}
- [boiling point](boiling%20point.md) and [melting point](melting%20point.md): {{sharp}} <!--SR:!2024-09-06,381,290!2024-03-28,283,330!2023-09-12,126,290!2023-11-18,179,310!2023-11-30,188,310-->
