# structural support

## support structure

### roller support

A roller support prevents {{vertical (relative to a support on the ground) translation}}, but not {{horizontal or lateral translation and rotation}}. Its reaction force is {{a single linear force perpendicular to the surface}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-16,160,310!2024-11-21,130,290!2024-10-05,95,290-->

A roller support is drawn as {{a circle or a triangle with two or more circles underneath}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-18,95,290-->

Examples include {{roller supports under an overhanging highway, wheels of a table with wheels}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,239,330-->

### pinned support

A pinned support prevents {{translation in any direction}}, but not {{rotation}}. Its reaction force is {{a single linear force in any direction}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-05,128,310!2024-08-11,66,310!2024-08-12,67,310-->

A pinned support is drawn as {{a triangle or a square with a circle in the middle}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-06,152,310-->

Examples include {{a table leg pinned by a single screw only, joints of a truss}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-23,83,270-->

### fixed support

A fixed support prevents {{translation and rotation in any direction}}. Its reaction forces are {{a single linear force in any direction and a [torque](torque.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-02,126,310!2024-12-22,164,310-->

A fixed support is {{usually not drawn specifically and represented by being connected to a fixed wall or ground}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-22,176,310-->

Examples include {{a computer monitor with a single non-rotatable support, fixed supports under a bridge}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-03,115,290-->

Note that the reaction [torque](torque.md) only makes sense when {{you consider that the support is not a single ideal point, or otherwise the moment arm is always zero}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-11,156,310-->
