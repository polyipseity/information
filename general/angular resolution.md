# angular resolution

The colloquial use of the term "resolution" sometimes causes confusion; when an optical system is said to {{have a high resolution or high angular resolution, it means that the perceived distance, or actual angular distance, between resolved neighboring objects is small}}. The value that quantifies this property, _θ_, which is given by the [Rayleigh criterion](#Rayleigh's%20criterion), is {{low for a system with a high resolution}}. <!--SR:!2025-10-14,349,350!2025-10-25,359,350-->

## Rayleigh's criterion

The {{Rayleigh}}'s criterion is that {{two point sources are considered just resolved when the principal diffraction maximum of the [Airy disk](Airy%20disk.md) of an image coincide with the first minimum of the [Airy disk](Airy%20disk.md) of the other}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-17,500,330!2025-10-30,549,250-->

According to the criterion, diffraction through a circular [aperture](aperture.md) gives:

> diffraction {{through a circular [aperture](aperture.md)}}
>
> - {{$\theta \approx \sin \theta = 1.22 \frac \lambda D \quad\mathrm{(considering\ that\ \sin \theta \approx \theta)}$}}
>
> where {{_θ_ is _angular resolution_ in [radians](radian.md), _λ_ is the [wavelength](wavelength.md), and _D_ is the [diameter](diameter.md) of the [aperture](aperture.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-20,503,330!2025-01-08,247,270!2025-07-14,591,310-->
