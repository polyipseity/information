# pH

__pH__ is {{a scale of the [acidity](acid.md) or [basicity](base%20(chemistry).md) of an [aqueous solution](aqueous%20solution.md)}}. Lower pH means {{acidic, and high pH means basic or [alkaline](alkali.md)}}. <!--SR:!2026-02-13,801,330!2025-10-28,715,330-->

It is defined as {{the negative [logarithm](logarithmic%20scale.md) of the [activity](thermodynamic%20activity.md) of [hydrogen ion](hydrogen%20ion.md) in the [solution](solution%20(chemistry).md), which is approximately the [concentration](concentration.md) of it}}: <!--SR:!2024-08-02,300,250-->

> {{$\text{pH}=-\log\left(a_{\text{H}^+}\right)\approx-\log\left(\left[\text{H}^+\text{(aq)}\right]\right)$}}
>
> where {{\[H<sup>+</sup>(aq)\] is the [equilibrium](equilibrium%20chemistry.md) [molar concentration](molar%20concentration.md) of H<sup>+</sup>}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-11,329,310!2024-02-06,66,332-->

Solutions where {{\[H<sup>+</sup>(aq)\] equals \[OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)\] are neutral, the former is greater than the latter are [acidic](acid.md), and the former is lesser than the latter are [basic](base%20(chemistry).md)}}. At {{25 °C (77 °F), pH 7}} is neutral. <!--SR:!2026-01-29,784,330!2024-03-12,127,250-->

## measurement

- See: [pH indicator](pH%20indicator.md)

pH indicators are used to measure pH by {{measuring their color}}. A [universal indicator](universal%20indicator.md) contains {{several indicators such that its its color changes continuously from about pH 2 to pH 10. It can be impregnated onto a paper to make pH papers}}. For more accuracy, {{a [pH meter](pH%20meter.md) can be used}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-05,367,310!2024-05-01,221,230!2024-05-08,311,330-->
