# barred spiral galaxy

A __barred spiral galaxy__ (denoted {{SB}}) is {{a [spiral galaxy](spiral%20galaxy.md) with a central bar-shaped structure composed of [stars](star.md)}}. Bars are found in {{about two thirds of all spiral galaxies in the local universe}}, and generally affect {{both the motions of stars and [interstellar gas](interstellar%20medium.md) within spiral galaxies and can affect [spiral arms](spiral%20arm.md) as well}}. {{The [Milky Way Galaxy](Milky%20Way.md)}}, where {{the [Solar System](Solar%20System.md) is located}}, is classified as {{a barred spiral galaxy}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-06,3,250!2024-08-06,3,250!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270-->
