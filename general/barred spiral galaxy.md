# barred spiral galaxy

A __barred spiral galaxy__ (denoted {{SB}}) is {{a [spiral galaxy](spiral%20galaxy.md) with a central bar-shaped structure composed of [stars](star.md)}}. Bars are found in {{about two thirds of all spiral galaxies in the local universe}}, and generally affect {{both the motions of stars and [interstellar gas](interstellar%20medium.md) within spiral galaxies and can affect [spiral arms](spiral%20arm.md) as well}}. {{The [Milky Way Galaxy](Milky%20Way.md)}}, where {{the [Solar System](Solar%20System.md) is located}}, is classified as {{a barred spiral galaxy}}. <!--SR:!2025-06-09,236,330!2025-05-02,199,310!2025-04-29,178,270!2025-08-06,266,290!2025-05-17,214,330!2025-07-21,271,330!2025-08-24,293,330-->
