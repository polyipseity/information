# X-ray binary

__X-ray binaries__ are {{a class of [binary stars](binary%20star.md) that are luminous in [X-rays](X-ray.md)}}. The X-rays are {{produced by matter falling from one component, called the _donor_ (usually a relatively common [main sequence](main%20sequence.md) [star](star.md)), to the other component, called the _accretor_, which is either a [neutron star](neutron%20star.md) or [black hole](black%20hole.md)}}. The infalling matter {{releases [gravitational potential energy](gravitational%20energy.md), up to 30 percent of its rest mass, as X-rays}}. (Hydrogen [fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md) releases {{only about 0.7 percent of rest mass}}.) The lifetime and the mass-transfer rate in an X-ray binary depends on {{the evolutionary status of the donor star, the mass ratio between the stellar components, and their orbital separation}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-21,60,310!2024-10-30,60,270!2024-09-01,18,250!2024-09-17,31,290!2024-10-07,39,250-->
