# Earth's circumference

## history

### Eratosthenes

The measure of Earth's circumference is the most famous among the results obtained by {{[Eratosthenes](Eratosthenes.md) in 240 BC}}, who estimated that the meridian has {{a length of 252&nbsp;000 [stadia](stadion%20(unit).md), with an error on the real value (40&nbsp;007.863 km) between −2.4% and +0.8%}} (assuming {{a value for the stadion between 155 and 160 metres}}; the exact value of the stadion remains a subject of debate to this day; see [stadion](stadion%20(unit).md)). <!--SR:!2024-09-01,34,270!2024-10-15,47,250!2024-09-04,34,270-->

Eratosthenes described his technique in {{a book entitled _On the measure of the Earth_, which has not been preserved}}; what has been preserved is {{the simplified version described by [Cleomedes](Cleomedes.md) to popularise the discovery}}. Cleomedes invites his reader to consider two Egyptian cities, {{[Alexandria](Alexandria.md) and Syene (modern [Assuan](Aswan.md))}}. Using {{two poles perpendicular to the ground in the two cities respectively during the [summer solstice](summer%20solstice.md)}}, the angle of {{the [Sun](Sun.md)'s rays is measured to be about 7.2°}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-04,38,290!2024-09-06,40,290!2024-09-22,47,290!2024-09-06,34,270!2025-01-11,135,310-->
