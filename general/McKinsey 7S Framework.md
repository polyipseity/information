## objective

The framework has {{7 _interdependent_ elements}}, of which {{3 are _hard elements_ and 4 are _soft elements_}}. Hard elements {{might be easier to define than soft elements but they are equally important}}. The most important element is {{shared values}}.

The 3 hard elements are {{_strategy_, _structure_, and _systems_}}.

- _strategy_ ::: actions intended to enhance competitive advantage
- _structure_ ::: coordination and integration mechanisms, and division of activities
- _systems_ ::: formal and informal procedures for allocation, measurement, and reward

The 4 soft elements are {{_shared values_, _skills_, _staff_, and _style_}}.

- _shared values_ ::: core beliefs and values forming the corporate culture
- _skills_ ::: core competencies and distinctive capabilities, such as existing skills, skill development
- _staff_ ::: hiring and firing standards or policies, and staff characteristics
- _style_ ::: behavior patterns of key groups, such as management style
