# correlation

- This article is about {{correlation and dependence in statistical data}}. For other uses, see [correlation (disambiguation)](correlation%20(disambiguation).md). <!--SR:!2024-10-13,13,290-->

In [statistics](statistics.md), __correlation__ or __dependence__ is {{any statistical relationship, whether [causal](causality.md) or not, between two [random variables](random%20variable.md) or [bivariate data](bivariate%20data.md)}}. Although in the broadest sense, "correlation" may {{indicate any type of association}}, in statistics it {{usually refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are _[linearly](line%20(geometry).md)_ related}}. Familiar examples of dependent phenomena include {{the correlation between the [height](human%20height.md) of parents and their offspring}}, and {{the correlation between the price of a good and the quantity the consumers are willing to purchase}}, as {{it is depicted in the so-called [demand curve](demand%20curve.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-04,27,270!2024-10-15,15,290!2024-10-13,13,290!2024-10-10,12,270!2024-10-09,11,270!2024-10-13,13,290-->

Correlations are {{useful}} because {{they can indicate a predictive relationship that can be exploited in practice}}. For example, an electrical utility may {{produce less power on a mild day based on the correlation between electricity demand and weather}}. In this example, there is {{a [causal relationship](causality.md)}}, because {{[extreme weather](extreme%20weather.md) causes people to use more electricity for heating or cooling}}. However, in general, the presence of a correlation is {{not sufficient to infer the presence of a causal relationship (i.e., [correlation does not imply causation](correlation%20does%20not%20imply%20causation.md))}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-10,12,270!2024-10-13,13,290!2024-10-11,13,270!2024-10-09,11,270!2024-10-13,13,290!2024-11-11,34,290-->

Formally, random variables are {{_dependent_}} if {{they do not satisfy a mathematical property of [probabilistic independence](independence%20(probability%20theory).md)}}. In {{informal parlance}}, _correlation_ is {{synonymous with _dependence_}}. However, when {{used in a technical sense}}, correlation refers to {{any of several specific types of mathematical relationship between [the conditional expectation of one variable given the other is not constant as the conditioning variable changes](conditional%20expectation.md)}}; broadly correlation in this specific sense is used when {{$E(Y|X=x)$ is related to $x$ in some manner}} (such as {{linearly, monotonically, or perhaps according to some particular functional form such as logarithmic}}). Essentially, correlation is {{the measure of how two or more variables are related to one another}}. There are {{several [correlation coefficients](correlation%20coefficient.md)}}, often denoted {{$\rho$ or $r$}}, measuring {{the degree of correlation}}. The most common of these is {{the _[Pearson correlation coefficient](Pearson%20correlation%20coefficient.md)_}}, which is {{sensitive only to a linear relationship between two variables (which may be present even when one variable is a nonlinear function of the other)}}. Other correlation coefficients – such as {{_[Spearman's rank correlation](Spearman's%20rank%20correlation%20coefficient.md)_}} – have been developed to be {{more [robust](robust%20statistics.md) than Pearson's, that is, more sensitive to nonlinear relationships}}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> {{[Mutual information](mutual%20information.md)}} can {{also be applied to measure dependence between two variables}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-16,16,290!2024-11-08,31,270!2024-10-13,13,290!2024-10-13,13,290!2024-10-13,13,290!2024-10-14,14,290!2024-10-31,23,250!2024-11-02,25,270!2024-11-13,36,290!2024-10-13,13,290!2024-10-10,12,270!2024-10-11,13,270!2024-10-13,13,290!2024-11-03,26,270!2024-10-09,9,270!2024-10-14,14,290!2024-10-17,17,290!2024-10-31,23,270-->
