# shear wall

## description

Shear walls are {{vertically continuous structures}}, which are {{much stiffer than rigid frame and provides most lateral and some gravity resistance}}. Along the plane of shear walls, one may find {{multiple shear walls}}, and the shear walls are connected by {{beams or slabs}}. In a building, there may be {{multiple planes of shear walls}}, which are usually {{parallel to each other}}. It resists loads {{parallel to the plane of the shear wall}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-06,17,290!2024-06-06,17,290!2024-06-03,14,290!2024-06-02,13,270!2024-06-01,12,270!2024-06-04,15,290!2024-07-06,37,290-->

Economically, it makes sense {{until up to about 35 stories}}. Examples include {{high-rise residential buildings}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-10,41,290!2024-06-03,14,290-->

It can be combined with {{[rigid frame](rigid%20frame.md), constrained to deflect together}}, to get a {{shear-walled structure}}. This provides {{stiffer structure than rigid frame or shear walls alone}}. It is economic up to {{about 50 stories}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-05,16,290!2024-05-31,11,270!2024-06-13,18,270!2024-06-03,14,290-->

In detail, the shear walls in a shear-walled structure often {{form box-shaped (C-shaped) cores around elevators and stairs around the center of the building}}. Such box-shaped core walls as a spatial system can {{transmit lateral loads in both directions, and can resist all types of loads}}. In practice, the shape of the cores are {{governed by elevator and stair requirements}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-04,15,290!2024-06-21,23,270!2024-06-23,27,270-->
