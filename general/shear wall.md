# shear wall

## description

Shear walls are {{vertically continuous structures}}, which are {{much stiffer than rigid frame and provides most lateral and some gravity resistance}}. Along the plane of shear walls, one may find {{multiple shear walls}}, and the shear walls are connected by {{beams or slabs}}. In a building, there may be {{multiple planes of shear walls}}, which are usually {{parallel to each other}}. It resists loads {{parallel to the plane of the shear wall}}. <!--SR:!2025-05-21,282,330!2025-03-09,209,310!2024-11-13,121,290!2025-01-27,190,310!2025-01-22,188,310!2025-04-05,247,330!2024-12-01,147,310-->

Economically, it makes sense {{until up to about 35 stories}}. Examples include {{high-rise residential buildings}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-22,164,310!2025-01-06,163,310-->

It can be combined with {{[rigid frame](rigid%20frame.md), constrained to deflect together}}, to get a {{shear-walled structure}}. This provides {{stiffer structure than rigid frame or shear walls alone}}. It is economic up to {{about 50 stories}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-17,193,310!2024-12-18,160,310!2025-02-28,193,290!2025-01-03,160,310-->

In detail, the shear walls in a shear-walled structure often {{form box-shaped (C-shaped) cores around elevators and stairs around the center of the building}}. Such box-shaped core walls as a spatial system can {{transmit lateral loads in both directions, and can resist all types of loads}}. In practice, the shape of the cores are {{governed by elevator and stair requirements}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-31,181,310!2025-05-23,250,290!2025-07-21,292,290-->
