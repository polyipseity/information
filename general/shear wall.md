# shear wall

## description

Shear walls are {{vertically continuous structures}}, which are {{much stiffer than rigid frame and provides most lateral and some gravity resistance}}. Along the plane of shear walls, one may find {{multiple shear walls}}, and the shear walls are connected by {{beams or slabs}}. In a building, there may be {{multiple planes of shear walls}}, which are usually {{parallel to each other}}. It resists loads {{parallel to the plane of the shear wall}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-11,66,310!2024-08-12,67,310!2024-07-15,42,290!2024-07-19,47,290!2024-07-18,47,290!2024-08-01,58,310!2024-07-06,37,290-->

Economically, it makes sense {{until up to about 35 stories}}. Examples include {{high-rise residential buildings}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-10,41,290!2024-07-26,53,310-->

It can be combined with {{[rigid frame](rigid%20frame.md), constrained to deflect together}}, to get a {{shear-walled structure}}. This provides {{stiffer structure than rigid frame or shear walls alone}}. It is economic up to {{about 50 stories}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-07,63,310!2024-07-10,40,290!2024-08-19,67,290!2024-07-25,52,310-->

In detail, the shear walls in a shear-walled structure often {{form box-shaped (C-shaped) cores around elevators and stairs around the center of the building}}. Such box-shaped core walls as a spatial system can {{transmit lateral loads in both directions, and can resist all types of loads}}. In practice, the shape of the cores are {{governed by elevator and stair requirements}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-02,59,310!2024-09-15,86,290!2024-10-02,101,290-->
