# orbital period

### synodic period

One of the observable characteristics of two bodies which {{[orbit](orbit.md) a third body in different orbits, and thus have different orbital periods}}, is their {{__synodic period__, which is the time between [conjunctions](conjunction%20(astronomy).md)}}. It can also be defined for {{a satellite of a body orbiting a third body}}, in which case {{the third body is used as the reference}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-11,52,310!2024-09-18,58,310!2024-07-25,17,290!2024-09-17,57,310-->

An example of this related period description is {{the repeated cycles for [celestial bodies](astronomical%20object.md) as observed from the [Earth](Earth.md)'s surface}}. The __synodic period__ applies to {{the elapsed time where same kind of phenomenon happens or planets return to the same location}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-20,33,290!2024-09-04,45,290-->

If {{the orbital periods of two bodies around a third}} are {{called _T<sub>1</sub>_ and _T<sub>2</sub>_, where _T<sub>1</sub>_ < _T<sub>2</sub>_}}, their synodic period, if {{both bodies are orbiting in the same direction}}, is given by: {{$$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} - \frac 1 {T_2}$$}}. This also applies for {{a satellite of a second body orbiting a third body, where the satellite orbits the same direction as the second body orbiting the third body}}. _T<sub>1</sub>_ and _T<sub>2</sub>_ instead are orbital periods of {{the satellite and the second body, subject to the same constraint _T<sub>1</sub>_ < _T<sub>2</sub>_}}. If the orbiting directions are opposing (applies for both cases), the formula has {{its minus sign replaced by a positive sign}}: {{$$\frac 1 {T_\text{syn} } = \frac 1 {T_1} + \frac 1 {T_2}$$}}. Note that in this formula only, {{_T<sub>1</sub>_ and _T<sub>2</sub>_ can be arbitrarily swapped, as addition is commutative}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-24,16,290!2024-07-24,16,290!2024-09-07,48,310!2024-07-25,17,290!2024-09-06,45,290!2024-08-07,24,270!2024-09-05,44,290!2024-07-24,16,290!2024-09-01,40,290-->
