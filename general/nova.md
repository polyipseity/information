# nova

A __nova__ (pl. __novae__ or __novas__) is {{a [transient astronomical event](time-domain%20astronomy.md) that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently "new" star (hence the name "nova", Latin for "new") that slowly fades over weeks or months}}. All observed novae involve {{[white dwarfs](white%20dwarf.md) in close [binary systems](binary%20star.md)}}, but causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova {{vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars}}. The main sub-classes of novae are {{classical novae, recurrent novae (RNe), and [dwarf novae](dwarf%20nova.md)}}. They are all considered to be {{[cataclysmic variable stars](cataclysmic%20variable%20star.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-06,3,250!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-06,3,250!2024-08-06,3,250-->

Classical nova eruptions are {{the most common type}}. This type is usually created in {{a close binary star system consisting of a white dwarf and either a [main sequence](main%20sequence.md), [subgiant](subgiant.md), or [red giant star](red%20giant.md)}}. If {{the orbital period of the system is a few days or less}}, the white dwarf is {{close enough to its companion star to draw [accreted](accretion%20(astrophysics).md) matter onto its surface, creating a dense but shallow [atmosphere](stellar%20atmosphere.md)}}. This atmosphere, mostly consisting of {{hydrogen}}, is {{heated by the hot white dwarf and eventually reaches a critical temperature, causing ignition of rapid [runaway](thermal%20runaway.md) [fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md)}}. The sudden increase in energy expels {{the atmosphere into interstellar space, creating the envelope seen as visible light during the nova event}}. In past centuries {{such an event was thought to be a new star}}. A few novae produce {{short-lived [nova remnants](nova%20remnant.md), lasting for perhaps several centuries}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-06,3,250!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-06,3,250-->

A recurrent nova involves {{the same processes as a classical nova, except that the nova event repeats in cycles of a few decades or less}} as {{the companion star again feeds the dense atmosphere of the white dwarf after each ignition}}, as in the star [T Coronae Borealis](T%20Coronae%20Borealis.md). <!--SR:!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-06,3,250-->
