# first-order logic

__First-order logic__—also called {{__predicate logic__, __predicate calculus__, __quantificational logic__}}—is {{a collection of [formal systems](formal%20system.md) used in [mathematics](mathematics.md), [philosophy](philosophy.md), [linguistics](linguistics.md), and [computer science](computer%20science.md)}}. First-order logic uses {{[quantified variables](quantifier%20(logic).md) over non-logical objects, and allows the use of sentences that contain variables}}, so that rather than propositions such as "all men are mortal", one can have expressions in the form {{"for all _x_, if _x_ is a man, then _x_ is mortal", where "for all _x"_ is a quantifier, while _x_ is a variable}}. This distinguishes it from [propositional logic](propositional%20calculus.md), which {{does not use quantifiers or [relations](finitary%20relation.md); in this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-27,58,310!2024-11-17,51,310!2024-12-03,64,310!2024-11-26,57,310!2024-11-04,37,290-->

{{A theory about a topic, such as set theory, a theory for groups, or a formal theory of [arithmetic](arithmetic.md)}}, is {{usually a first-order logic together with a specified [domain of discourse](domain%20of%20discourse.md) (over which the quantified variables range), finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many [predicates](predicate%20(mathematical%20logic).md) defined on that domain, and a set of axioms believed to hold about them}}. "Theory" is sometimes understood in {{a more formal sense as just a set of sentences in first-order logic}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-11,71,310!2025-01-30,102,290!2024-12-10,70,310-->

The term "first-order" distinguishes first-order logic from [higher-order logic](higher-order%20logic.md), in which {{there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which quantification over predicates, functions, or both, are permitted}}. In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with {{sets. In interpreted higher-order theories, predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-15,46,290!2024-11-11,42,290-->

There are many [deductive systems](formal%20system.md#deductive%20system) for first-order logic which are {{both [sound](soundness.md#logical%20systems), i.e. all provable statements are true in all models, and [complete](completeness%20(logic).md), i.e. all statements which are true in all models are provable}}. Although {{the [logical consequence](logical%20consequence.md) relation is only [semidecidable](decidability%20(logic).md#semidecidability)}}, much progress has been made in {{[automated theorem proving](automated%20theorem%20proving.md) in first-order logic}}. First-order logic also {{satisfies several [metalogical](metalogic.md) theorems that make it amenable to analysis in [proof theory](proof%20theory.md)}}, such as {{the [Löwenheim–Skolem theorem](Löwenheim–Skolem%20theorem.md) and the [compactness theorem](compactness%20theorem.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-05,38,290!2025-01-12,79,270!2025-03-30,152,310!2025-04-08,159,310!2024-11-05,14,250-->

First-order logic is the standard for {{the formalization of mathematics into [axioms](axiomatic%20system.md), and is studied in the [foundations of mathematics](foundations%20of%20mathematics.md)}}. {{[Peano arithmetic](peano%20axioms.md) and [Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory](Zermelo–Fraenkel%20set%20theory.md)}} are {{axiomatizations of [number theory](number%20theory.md) and [set theory](set%20theory.md), respectively, into first-order logic}}. No first-order theory, however, has {{the strength to uniquely describe a structure with an infinite domain, such as the [natural numbers](natural%20number.md) or the [real line](number%20line.md)}}. Axiom systems that {{do fully describe these two structures, i.e. [categorical](categorical%20theory.md) axiom systems}}, can be {{obtained in stronger logics such as [second-order logic](second-order%20logic.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-18,48,290!2024-12-04,57,270!2025-01-11,79,270!2024-12-23,69,270!2025-04-01,152,310!2025-03-18,143,310-->

The foundations of first-order logic were {{developed independently by [Gottlob Frege](Gottlob%20Frege.md) and [Charles Sanders Peirce](Charles%20Sanders%20Peirce.md)}}. For a history of first-order logic and how it came to dominate formal logic, see José Ferreirós (2001). <!--SR:!2024-12-12,58,250-->
