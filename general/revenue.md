In [accounting](accounting.md), __revenue__ is {{the total amount of income generated by the sale of [goods and services](product%20(business).md) related to the primary operations of the [business](business.md)}}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> {{Commercial revenue}} may also be referred to {{as __sales__ or as __turnover__}}. Some [companies](company.md) receive revenue from {{[interest](interest.md), [royalties](royalty%20payment.md), or other [fees](fee.md)}}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> "Revenue" may refer to {{income in general, or it may refer to the amount, in a [monetary unit](currency.md), earned during a period of time, as in "Last year, company X had revenue of $42 million"}}. {{[Profits](profit%20(accounting).md) or [net income](net%20income.md)}} generally imply {{total revenue minus total expenses in a given period}}. In [accounting](accounting.md), revenue is {{a subsection of the equity section of the balance statement, since it increases equity}}. It is often referred to as {{the "top line" due to its position at the very top of the [income statement](income%20statement.md)}}. This is to be contrasted with {{the "bottom line" which denotes net income (gross revenues minus total expenses)}}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-10-09,16,290!2024-10-10,17,290!2024-10-02,9,270!2024-10-03,10,270!2024-10-07,14,290!2024-10-08,15,290!2024-10-10,17,290!2024-10-02,13,270!2024-11-02,34,270!2024-10-09,16,290-->
