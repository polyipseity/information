# Milky Way

## intergalactic neighborhood

- see: [Local Group](Local%20Group.md)

Current measurements suggest the [Andromeda Galaxy](Andromeda%20Galaxy.md) is {{approaching the Milky Way at 100 to 140 km/s (220&nbsp;000 to 310&nbsp;000 mph)}}. In {{4.3 billion years}}, there {{may be an [Andromeda–Milky Way collision](Andromeda–Milky%20Way%20collision.md), depending on the importance of unknown lateral components to the galaxies' relative motion}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-30,4,270!2024-06-30,4,270!2024-06-30,4,270-->
