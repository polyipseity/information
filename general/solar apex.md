# solar apex

## direction

The solar apex is {{in the constellation of [Hercules](Hercules%20(constellation).md) near the star [Vega](Vega.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-13,13,290-->

For {{more than 30 years before 1986}}, the speed of the [Sun](Sun.md) towards the solar apex was {{taken to be about 20 km/s}} but {{all later studies give a smaller component in the vector toward galactic longitude 90Â°, reducing overall speed to about 13.4 km/s}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-11,31,270!2024-07-12,12,270!2024-08-06,26,270-->
