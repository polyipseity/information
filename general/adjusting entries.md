# adjusting entries

In [accounting](accounting.md), __adjusting entries__ are {{[journal](general%20journal.md) entries usually made at the end of an accounting period to allocate [income](income.md) and [expenditure](expense.md) to the period in which they actually occurred}}. {{The [revenue recognition principle](revenue%20recognition.md)}} is {{the basis of making adjusting entries that pertain to unearned and accrued revenues under [accrual-basis accounting](accrual.md)}}. They are sometimes called {{Balance Day adjustments because they are made on balance day}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-20,3,250!2024-09-21,4,270-->

Based on {{the [matching principle](matching%20principle.md) of [accrual accounting](accrual.md)}}, {{[revenues](revenue.md) and associated [costs](cost.md) are recognized in the same accounting period}}. However {{the actual cash may be received or paid at a different time}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270-->

## types of adjusting entries

Most adjusting entries could be classified this way: {{prepaid expenses, accrued expenses, unearned revenues, accrued revenues}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-21,4,270-->

|          | __Prepayments__ ([Deferral](deferral.md) - cash paid or received before consumption)                | __[Accrual](accrual.md)__ - cash paid or received after consumption                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Expenses | Prepaid expenses: for expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used             | Accrued expenses: for expenses incurred but not yet paid in cash and not yet recorded   |
| Revenues | Unearned revenues: for revenues received in cash and recorded as liabilities before they are earned | Accrued revenues: for revenues earned but not yet recorded and not yet received in cash |

- prepaid expenses ::: for expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used <!--SR:!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270-->
- accrued expenses ::: for expenses incurred but not yet paid in cash and not yet recorded <!--SR:!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270-->
- unearned revenues ::: for revenues received in cash and recorded as liabilities before they are earned <!--SR:!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270-->
- accrued revenues ::: for revenues earned but not yet recorded and not yet received in cash <!--SR:!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270-->

### prepayments

{{Adjusting entries for prepayments}} are necessary to {{account for cash that has been received prior to delivery of goods or completion of services}}. When {{this cash is paid, it is first recorded in a prepaid expense asset account}}; the account is {{to be expensed either with the passage of time (e.g. rent, insurance) or through use and consumption (e.g. supplies)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270-->

{{A company receiving the cash for benefits yet to be delivered}} will have to {{record the amount in an unearned revenue [liability](liability%20(financial%20accounting).md) account}}. Then, {{an adjusting entry to recognize the revenue is used as necessary}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,3,250!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270-->

#### example

Assume {{a magazine publishing company charges an annual subscription fee of $12}}. The cash is {{paid up-front at the start of the subscription}}. The income, based on {{[sales basis method](revenue%20recognition%20method%20(page%20does%20not%20exist).md), is recognized upon delivery}}. Therefore, the initial reporting of the receipt of annual subscription fee is indicated as: <!--SR:!2024-09-20,3,250!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270-->

```text
                        Debit  |  Credit
                        ----------------
Cash                     $12   |         
  Unearned Revenue             |   $12
                               |
```

The adjusting entry reporting each month after the delivery is:

```text
                        Debit  |  Credit
                        ----------------
Unearned Revenue           $1  |   
  Revenue                      |    $1  
                               |
```

The unearned revenue after the first month is {{therefore $11 and revenue reported in the income statement is $1}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-21,4,270-->

### accruals

Accrued revenues are {{revenues that have been recognized (that is, services have been performed or goods have been delivered), but their cash payment have not yet been recorded or received}}. When the revenue is recognized, it is recorded as {{a receivable}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270-->

Accrued expenses {{have not yet been paid for, so they are recorded in a payable account}}. {{Expenses for interest, taxes, rent, and salaries}} are commonly accrued for reporting purposes. <!--SR:!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270-->

{{An income which has been earned but it has not been received yet during the accounting period}}, like {{rent, interest on investments, commission etc.}} are examples of accrued income. <!--SR:!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270-->

### estimates

A third classification of adjusting entry occurs {{where the exact amount of an expense cannot easily be determined}}. {{The [depreciation](depreciation.md) of fixed assets}}, for example, is {{an expense which has to be estimated}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270-->

The entry for bad debt expense can also be classified as an estimate.

### inventory

In {{a periodic [inventory](inventory.md) system}}, an adjusting entry is used to {{determine the [cost of goods sold](cost%20of%20goods%20sold.md) expense}}. This entry is {{not necessary for a company using [perpetual inventory](perpetual%20inventory.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,3,250!2024-09-21,4,270!2024-09-21,4,270-->
