# refracting telescope

A __refracting telescope__ (also called a __refractor__) is {{a type of [optical telescope](optical%20telescope.md) that uses a [lens](lens.md) as its [objective](objective%20(optics).md) to form an image (also referred to a [__dioptric telescope__](dioptrics.md))}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-13,138,290-->

## technical considerations

Refractors suffer from {{residual [chromatic](chromatic%20aberration.md) and [spherical aberration](spherical%20aberration.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-08-17,301,330-->

In very large apertures, there is also {{a problem of [lens sagging](lens%20sag.md), a result of [gravity](gravity.md) deforming [glass](glass.md)}}. Since a lens can {{only be held in place by its edge, the center of a large lens sags due to gravity, distorting the images it produces}}. The largest practical lens size in a refracting telescope is {{around 1 meter (39 in)}}. <!--SR:!2025-06-04,239,330!2025-03-28,182,310!2025-01-09,112,290-->
