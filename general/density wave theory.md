# density wave theory

__Density wave theory__ or {{the __Lin–Shu density wave theory__}} is {{a theory proposed by [C.C. Lin](Chia-Chiao%20Lin.md) and [Frank Shu](Frank%20Shu.md) in the mid-1960s to explain the spiral arm structure of [spiral galaxies](spiral%20galaxy.md)}}. The Lin–Shu theory introduces {{the idea of long-lived [quasistatic](quasistatic%20process.md) spiral structure (QSSS hypothesis)}}. In this hypothesis, the spiral pattern {{rotates with a particular angular frequency (pattern speed)}}, whereas the stars in the [galactic disk](galactic%20disc.md) {{orbit at [varying speeds](galaxy%20rotation%20curve.md), which depend on their distance to the [galaxy center](Galactic%20Center.md)}}. The presence of spiral density waves in galaxies has implications on {{[star formation](star%20formation.md), since the gas orbiting around the galaxy may be compressed and cause shock waves periodically}}. Theoretically, the formation of a global spiral pattern is treated as {{an [instability](hydrodynamic%20stability.md) of the stellar disk caused by the [self-gravity](self-gravitation.md), as opposed to [tidal interactions](tidal%20force.md)}}. The mathematical formulation of the theory has also been extended to {{other astrophysical disk systems, such as [Saturn's rings](Rings%20of%20Saturn.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-28,40,290!2024-09-10,25,250!2024-10-12,51,310!2024-11-13,71,270!2024-10-19,57,310!2024-10-10,47,290!2024-12-01,83,270!2024-10-21,60,310-->
