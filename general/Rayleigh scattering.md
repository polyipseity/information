# Rayleigh scattering

{@{__Rayleigh scattering__}@} (/ˈreɪli/ RAY-lee), named after {@{the 19th-century British physicist [Lord Rayleigh](John%20William%20Strutt,%203rd%20Baron%20Rayleigh.md) (John William Strutt)}@}, is {@{the predominantly [elastic scattering](elastic%20scattering.md) of [light](light.md), or other [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md), by particles with a size much smaller than the [wavelength](wavelength.md) of the radiation}@}. For {@{light frequencies well below the [resonance](resonance.md) frequency of the scattering medium (normal [dispersion](dispersion%20relation.md) regime)}@}, the amount of scattering is {@{[inversely proportional](proportionality%20(mathematics)#inverse%20proportionality.md) to the [fourth power](fourth%20power.md) of the wavelength}@}, e.g., {@{a blue color is scattered much more than a red color as light propagates through air}@}.
