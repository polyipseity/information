# Hayashi track

The __Hayashi track__ is {{a luminosity–temperature relationship obeyed by infant stars of less than 3 [M<sub>☉</sub>](solar%20mass.md) in the [pre-main-sequence phase](pre-main-sequence%20star.md) (PMS phase) of stellar evolution}}. It is named after {{Japanese astrophysicist [Chushiro Hayashi](Chushiro%20Hayashi.md)}}. On the [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md), which {{plots luminosity against temperature, the track is a nearly vertical curve}}. After a [protostar](protostar.md) {{ends its phase of rapid contraction and becomes a [T Tauri star](T%20Tauri%20star.md)}}, it is {{extremely luminous}}. The star {{continues to contract, but much more slowly. While slowly contracting}}, the star {{follows the Hayashi track downwards, becoming several times less luminous but staying at roughly the same surface temperature}}, until {{either a [radiative zone](radiation%20zone.md) develops, at which point the star starts following the [Henyey track](Henyey%20track.md), or nuclear fusion begins, marking its entry onto the [main sequence](main%20sequence.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-10,4,210!2024-08-11,8,250!2024-08-11,8,250!2024-08-10,7,250!2024-08-17,14,290!2024-08-16,13,270!2024-08-15,12,270!2024-08-16,8,230-->
