# absolute advantage

In [economics](economics.md), the principle of __absolute advantage__ is {@{the ability of a party (an individual, or firm, or country) to produce a [good or service](goods%20and%20services.md) more efficiently than its competitors}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> {@{The Scottish economist [Adam Smith](Adam%20Smith.md)}@} first described {@{the principle of absolute advantage in the context of [international trade](international%20trade.md) in 1776}@}, using {@{[labor](labour%20economics.md) as the only input}@}. Since {@{absolute advantage is determined by a simple comparison of [labor productiveness](workforce%20productivity.md)}@}, it is possible {@{for a party to have no absolute advantage in anything}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-04-23,151,310!2024-12-26,70,310!2025-03-12,109,290!2024-12-28,72,310!2025-06-14,193,310!2024-12-11,55,310-->

## origin of the theory

The concept of absolute advantage is generally attributed to {@{the Scottish economist [Adam Smith](Adam%20Smith.md)}@} in {@{his 1776 publication _[The Wealth of Nations](The%20Wealth%20of%20Nations.md)_}@}, in which {@{he countered [mercantilist](mercantilism.md) ideas}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup><sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> Smith argued that {@{it was impossible for all nations to become rich simultaneously by following [mercantilism](mercantilism.md)}@} because {@{the export of one nation is another nation's import}@} and instead {@{stated that all nations would gain simultaneously if they practiced free trade and specialized in accordance with their absolute advantage}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> Smith also stated that the wealth of nations {@{depends upon the goods and services available to their citizens, rather than their gold reserves}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-28,72,310!2025-03-25,126,290!2024-12-20,64,310!2024-12-24,68,310!2024-12-28,72,310!2024-12-20,64,310!2024-12-28,72,310-->

Because {@{Smith only focused on comparing labor productivities to determine absolute advantage}@}, he {@{did not develop the concept of [comparative advantage](comparative%20advantage.md)}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> While {@{there are possible gains from trade with absolute advantage}@}, the gains {@{may not be mutually beneficial}@}. {@{Comparative advantage}@} focuses on {@{the range of possible mutually beneficial exchanges}@}. <!--SR:!2025-03-07,120,310!2024-12-16,60,310!2024-12-20,64,310!2024-12-16,62,310!2024-12-20,64,310!2024-12-28,72,310-->

## examples

### example 1

Figure 1: Hours of work necessary to produce one unit

| __Country__  | __Cloth__ | __Wine__ |
| ------------ | --------- | -------- |
| __UK__       | 80        | 100      |
| __Portugal__ | 120       | 90       |

According to Figure 1, the UK commits 80 hours of labor to produce one unit of cloth, which is {@{fewer than Portugal's hours of work necessary to produce one unit of cloth}@}. The UK is {@{able to produce one unit of cloth with fewer hours of labor}@}, therefore {@{the UK has an absolute advantage in the production of cloth}@}. On the other hand, Portugal commits 90 hours to produce one unit of wine, which is {@{fewer than the UK's hours of work necessary to produce one unit of wine}@}. Therefore, {@{Portugal has an absolute advantage in the production of wine}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-11,57,310!2024-12-11,55,310!2024-12-11,55,310!2024-12-16,60,310!2024-12-16,60,310-->

Figure 2: Hours of work to commit after the specialization

| __Country__  | __Cloth__ | __Wine__ |
| ------------ | --------- | -------- |
| __UK__       | 80 + 100  | 0        |
| __Portugal__ | 0         | 90 + 120 |

If {@{the two countries specialize in producing the good for which they have the absolute advantage}@}, and if {@{they exchange part of the good with each other}@}, both of the two countries can {@{end up with more of each good than they would have in the absence of trade}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup><sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> In {@{the absence of trade}@}, {@{each country produces one unit of cloth and one unit of wine, i.e. a combined total production of 2 units of cloth and 2 units of wine}@}. Here, if the UK {@{commits all of its labor (80+100) for the production of cloth for which the UK has the absolute advantage}@}, the UK {@{produces (80+100)÷80=2.25 units of cloth}@}. On the other hand, if Portugal {@{commits all of its labor (90+120) for the production of wine}@}, Portugal {@{produces (90+120)÷90=2.33... units of wine}@}. The combined total production in this case is {@{2.25 units of cloth and 2.33 units of wine}@} which is {@{greater than the total production of each good had there been no specialization}@}. Assuming {@{free trade}@} this {@{will lead to cheaper prices for both goods for both countries}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-16,60,310!2024-12-16,60,310!2025-05-12,172,310!2024-12-16,60,310!2024-12-11,55,310!2024-12-24,68,310!2024-12-24,68,310!2024-12-16,62,310!2024-12-11,55,310!2024-12-16,60,310!2024-12-20,64,310!2024-12-24,68,310!2024-12-28,72,310-->

### example 2

You and your friends decided to help with fundraising for a local charity group by printing T-shirts and making birdhouses.

- __scenario 1__: One of your friends, Gina, can print 5 T-shirts or build 3 birdhouses an hour. Your other friend, Mike, can print 3 T-shirts an hour or build 2 birdhouses an hour. Because {@{your friend Gina is more productive at printing T-shirts and building birdhouses compared to Mike}@}, {@{she has an absolute advantage in both printing T-shirts and building birdhouses}@}.
- __scenario 2__: Suppose Gina wasn't as agile with the hammer and could only make 1 birdhouse an hour, but she took a [screen printing](screen%20printing.md) class and could print 10 T-shirts an hour. Mike on the other hand takes woodworking and so he can build 5 birdhouses an hour, but he doesn't know the first thing about making T-shirts so he can only print 2 T-shirts an hour. While {@{Gina would have the absolute advantage in printing shirts}@}, {@{Mike would have an absolute advantage in building birdhouses}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-24,68,310!2024-12-26,70,310!2024-12-28,72,310!2024-12-11,55,310-->
