# root cause analysis

RCA can be decomposed into {{4 steps}}: {{problem, trace, label, and graph}}.

1. problem ::: Identify and describe the problem clearly.
2. trace ::: Establish a timeline from a normal situation to the problem.
3. label ::: Distinguish between the root causes and other casual factors.
4. graph ::: Establish a [casual graph](casual%20graph.md) from the root causes to the problem.
