# speed

In [kinematics](kinematics.md), the __speed__ (commonly referred to as {{___v___}}) of an object is {{the [magnitude](magnitude%20(mathematics).md) of the change of its [position](position%20(geometry).md) over [time](time.md) or the magnitude of the change of its position per unit of time}}; it is thus {{a [scalar](scalar%20(physics).md) quantity}}.
