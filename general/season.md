# season

## causes and effects

### axial parallelism

The [Earth's orbit](Earth's%20orbit.md) exhibits {{approximate [axial parallelism](axial%20parallelism.md), mostly maintaining its direction toward [Polaris](Polaris.md) (the "[North Star](pole%20star.md)") year-round}}. This is one of the primary reasons for the Earth's seasons, as it allows {{the hemispheres to be tilted differently relative to the [Sun](Sun.md) depending on the Earth's position in the orbit}}. Minor variation {{in the direction of the axis, known as [axial precession](axial%20precession.md), takes place over the course of about 26&nbsp;000 years}}, and therefore {{is not noticeable to modern human civilization}}. <!--SR:!2025-05-15,243,330!2025-02-28,179,310!2024-09-16,60,310!2025-01-01,124,290-->

### axial tilt

The seasons result from {{the [Earth](Earth.md)'s [axis of rotation](rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md) being tilted with respect to its orbital plane by an angle of approximately 23.4 degrees}}, known as [axial tilt](axial%20tilt.md) or {{obliquity of the [ecliptic](ecliptic.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-04-22,225,330!2025-01-17,148,310-->

Regardless of {{the time of year}}, {{the [northern](Northern%20Hemisphere.md) and [southern](Souther%20Hemisphere.md) hemispheres always experience opposite seasons}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-17,61,310!2025-04-24,227,330-->

The effect of axial tilt is observable as {{the change in [day length](daytime.md) and altitude (also see [analemma](analemma.md)) of the [Sun](Sun.md) at solar [noon](noon.md) (the Sun's [culmination](culmination.md)) during the year}}. The change in day length leads to {{[sunlight](sunlight.md) being shone on the surface for different amount of time in a day, affecting how much energy is transmitted in a day}}. The low altitude of Sun {{during [winter](winter.md) means that incoming rays of solar radiation are spread over a larger area of the Earth's surface, so the light received is more indirect and of lower [intensity](solar%20irradiance.md)}}. The intensity can be approximated by {{multiplying $\cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the [normal](normal%20(geometry).md) of the surface and the direction of solar radiation}}. These two effects {{caused by axial tilt accounts for most of the seasonal variation in [climate](climate.md) in both hemispheres}}. <!--SR:!2025-05-12,243,341!2025-02-14,168,310!2025-01-12,149,321!2024-09-15,56,301!2024-11-24,105,290-->

For the same reason {{as in [§ elliptical Earth orbit](#elliptical%20Earth%20orbit)}}, axial tilt {{making some parts of the [Earth's surface](geoid.md) being closer or farther to the [Sun](Sun.md) does not contribute much to seasons}}, considering that {{the difference is very small—up to only thousands of [kilometers](kilometre.md)—compared to Earth's [orbital distance](semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-24,67,321!2025-02-04,166,310!2025-05-11,241,330-->

### elliptical Earth orbit

Compared to [axial parallelism](#axial%20parallelism) and [axial tilt](#axial%20tilt), {{other factors contribute little to seasonal [temperature](temperature.md) changes}}. The seasons are {{not caused by the variation in [Earth](Earth.md)'s distance to the [Sun](Sun.md) because of its [elliptical orbit](elliptic%20orbit.md)}}. In fact, Earth reaches {{[perihelion](apsis.md#perihelion%20and%20aphelion) (the point in its orbit closest to the Sun) in [January](January.md), and it reaches [aphelion](apsis.md#perihelion%20and%20aphelion) (the point farthest from the Sun) in [July](July.md)}}, so {{the slight contribution of [orbital eccentricity](orbital%20eccentricity.md) opposes the [temperature](temperature.md) trends of the seasons in the [Northern Hemisphere](Northern%20Hemisphere.md)}}. In general, as the Earth's [orbital distance](semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes.md) {{varies by about 3%, sunlight received varies by only about 7%}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-04,75,321!2025-02-20,159,301!2024-12-25,130,301!2024-09-18,62,321!2025-03-23,199,321-->
