# hydrogen line

The {{__hydrogen line__, __21 centimeter line__, or __H I line__}} is {{a [spectral line](spectral%20line.md) that is created by a change in the energy state of [solitary](monatomic%20gas.md), [electrically neutral](electric%20charge.md) [hydrogen atoms](hydrogen%20atom.md)}}. It is produced by {{a [spin](spin%20(physics).md)-flip transition, which means the direction of the electron's spin is reversed relative to the spin of the proton}}. This is {{a [quantum state](quantum%20state.md) change between the two [hyperfine levels](hyperfine%20structure.md) of the hydrogen [1](principal%20quantum%20number.md) [s](azimuthal%20quantum%20number.md) [ground state](ground%20state.md)}}. The [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) producing this line has a [frequency](frequency.md) of {{1420.405&nbsp;751&nbsp;768(2) [MHz](hertz.md) (1.42 GHz)}}, which is equivalent to a [wavelength](wavelength.md) of {{21.106&nbsp;114&nbsp;054&nbsp;160(30) cm in a [vacuum](vacuum.md)}}. According to {{the [Planck–Einstein relation](planck%20relation.md) _E_ = _hν_}}, the [photon](photon.md) emitted by this transition has an [energy](photon%20energy.md) of {{5.874&nbsp;326&nbsp;184&nbsp;1116(81) μ[eV](electronvolt.md) [9.411&nbsp;708&nbsp;152&nbsp;678(13)×10<sup>−25</sup> J]}}. The [constant of proportionality](proportionality%20(mathematics).md), _h_, is known as {{the [Planck constant](Planck%20constant.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-02,67,310!2025-02-14,144,310!2025-03-17,168,310!2024-12-18,87,270!2024-11-07,13,130!2024-11-10,15,130!2025-02-08,137,290!2024-10-31,14,130!2024-10-29,66,313-->
