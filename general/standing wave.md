# standing wave

## opposing waves

A _standing wave_ can be formed by {{the [superposition](superposition%20principle.md) of two [waves](wave.md) of the same [frequency](frequency.md) with opposite propagating directions}}. The opposite wave can be formed by, for instance, {{[reflection](reflection%20(physics).md) from a boundary}}. Open boundary {{preserves the phase (negate $t$ and $\phi$; negate $A$ for sine waves) while fixed boundary inverts the wave (negate $t$ and $\phi$; negate $A$ for cosine waves), i.e. shifts the phase by [Ï€](pi.md)}}. <!--SR:!2026-02-22,557,310!2024-11-07,251,330!2024-10-06,64,230-->

## mathematical description

> [!tip] tips

> - solving [boundary value problem](boundary%20value%20problem.md) visually ::: One can imagine the standing wave extends beyond the boundaries forever. Then the boundary values or [functions](function%20(mathematics).md) matching the standing wave at all [times](time.md) is sufficient for a solution. <!--SR:!2024-08-24,182,320!2024-10-19,166,329-->
