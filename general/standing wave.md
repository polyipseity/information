# standing wave

## opposing waves

A _standing wave_ can be formed by {{the [superposition](superposition%20principle.md) of two [waves](wave.md) of the same [frequency](frequency.md) with opposite propagating directions}}. The opposite wave can be formed by {{[reflection](reflection%20(physics).md) from a boundary}}. Open boundary {{preserves the phase (negate $t$ and $\phi$; negate $A$ for sine waves) while fixed boundary inverts the wave (negate $t$ and $\phi$; negate $A$ for cosine waves), i.e. shifts the phase by [Ï€](pi.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-01-02,16,290!2024-01-01,15,290!2023-12-30,4,250-->

## mathematical description

> - solving [boundary value problem](boundary%20value%20problem.md) visually: {{One can imagine the standing wave extends beyond the boundaries forever. Then the boundary values or [functions](function%20(mathematics).md) matching the standing wave at the boundary [position](position%20(geometry).md) at all [times](time.md) is sufficient for a solution.}} <!--SR:!2024-01-09,15,300-->
