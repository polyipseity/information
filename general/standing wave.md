# standing wave

## opposing waves

A _standing wave_ can be formed by {{the [superposition](superposition%20principle.md) of two [waves](wave.md) of the same [frequency](frequency.md) with opposite propagating directions}}. The opposite wave can be formed by {{[reflection](reflection%20(physics).md) from a boundary}}. Open boundary {{preserves the phase (negate $t$ and $\phi$; negate $A$ for sine waves) while fixed boundary inverts the wave (negate $t$ and $\phi$; negate $A$ for cosine waves), i.e. shifts the phase by [Ï€](pi.md)}}.
