# standing wave

## opposing waves

A _standing wave_ can be formed by {{the [superposition](superposition%20principle.md) of two [waves](wave.md) of the same [frequency](frequency.md) with opposite propagating directions}}. The opposite wave can be formed by {{[reflection](reflection%20(physics).md) from a boundary}}. Open boundary {{preserves the phase while fixed boundary shifts the phase by [Ï€](pi.md), i.e. inverts the wave}}. <!--SR:!2023-12-17,4,270!2023-12-17,4,270!2023-12-17,4,270-->
