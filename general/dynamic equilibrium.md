# dynamic equilibrium

A __dynamic equilibrium__ exists when {{the [concentrations](concentration.md) of both [reactants](reagent.md) and [products](product%20(chemistry).md) of a [reversible reaction](reversible%20reaction.md) are non-zero and remain unchanged in a [closed system](closed%20system.md)}}. The forward [reaction rate](reaction%20rate.md) {{equals the backward [reaction rate](reaction%20rate.md)}}. It can be reached {{from both sides of the equilibrium}}. It can be characterized by {{an [equilibrium constant](equilibrium%20constant.md)}}.
