# dynamic equilibrium

A __dynamic equilibrium__ exists when {@{the [concentrations](concentration.md) of both [reactants](reagent.md) and [products](product%20(chemistry).md) of a [reversible reaction](reversible%20reaction.md) are non-zero and remain unchanged in a [closed system](closed%20system.md)}@}. The forward [reaction rate](reaction%20rate.md) {@{equals the backward [reaction rate](reaction%20rate.md)}@}. It can be reached {@{from both sides of the equilibrium}@}. It can be characterized by {@{an [equilibrium constant](equilibrium%20constant.md)}@}.
