# Type II supernova

A __Type II supernova__ or __SNII__ (plural: _supernovae_) results from {@{the rapid collapse and violent explosion of a massive [star](star.md). A star must have at least eight times, but no more than 40 to 50 times, the [mass of the Sun](solar%20mass.md) ([M<sub>â˜‰</sub>](solar%20mass.md)) to undergo this type of explosion}@}. Type II supernovae are distinguished from other types of [supernovae](supernova.md) by {@{the presence of hydrogen in their [spectra](spectrum.md)}@}. They are usually observed in {@{the [spiral arms](spiral%20arm.md) of [galaxies](galaxy.md) and in [H II regions](H%20II%20region.md), but not in [elliptical galaxies](elliptical%20galaxy.md)}@}; those are {@{generally composed of older, low-mass stars, with few of the young, very massive stars necessary to cause a supernova}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-06,112,250!2025-01-24,118,290!2025-03-24,152,270!2024-12-31,105,290-->
