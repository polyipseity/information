# relativistic Doppler effect

## summary of major results

>   - {{$f_r$ is the received [frequency](frequency.md), $f_s$ is the source [frequency](frequency.md)}}
>   - {{$\beta = \frac v c$, where $v$ is the [relative velocity](relative%20velocity.md) between the source and receiver that is positive when moving away from each other and $c$ is the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md) in [vacuum](vacuum.md)}}
> - The ratio in the second equation is also called {{the __Doppler factor__ of the source relative to the receiver}}. <!--SR:!2025-07-04,342,250!2024-10-10,231,330!2025-07-10,382,290!2024-10-27,202,290-->
