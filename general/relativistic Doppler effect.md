# relativistic Doppler effect

## summary of major results

> {{$$\begin{aligned} f_r & = \sqrt{ \frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta} } f_s \\ \frac{f_s}{f_r} & = \sqrt{ \frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta} } \end{aligned}$$}}

> - where
>     - {{$f_r$ is the received [frequency](frequency.md), $f_s$ is the source [frequency](frequency.md)}}
>     - {{$\beta = \frac v c$, where $v$ is the [relative velocity](relative%20velocity.md) between the source and receiver that is positive when moving away from each other and $c$ is the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md) in [vacuum](vacuum.md)}}
> - The ratio in the second equation is also called {{the __Doppler factor__ of the source relative to the receiver}}. <!--SR:!2023-12-24,8,250!2023-12-30,13,290!2023-12-28,12,270!2023-12-31,14,290-->
