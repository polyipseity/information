### analysis of the units

#### Planck time

{{The Planck time t<sub>P</sub>}} is {{the [time](time.md) required for [light](light.md) to travel a distance of 1 Planck length in [vacuum](vacuum.md)}}, which is a time interval of {{approximately 5.39×10<sup>−44</sup> [s](second.md)}}. {{No current physical theory can describe timescales}} shorter than the Planck time, such as {{the earliest events after the Big Bang}}. Some conjectures state that {{the structure of time need not remain smooth on intervals comparable to the Planck time}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,1,210!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270-->
