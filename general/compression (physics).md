# compression

## effects

For {{uniaxial compression}}, ordinary material are likely to undergo {{elastic deformation}}; that is, {{shortening in length and bulging in the middle, and returning to its original length and shape once the compression is removed}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-23,51,310!2024-06-04,15,290!2024-06-29,29,270-->
