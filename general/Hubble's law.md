# Hubble's law

__Hubble's law__, also known as {{the __Hubble–Lemaître law__}}, is {{the observation in [physical cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md) that [galaxies](galaxy.md) are moving away from [Earth](Earth.md) at speeds proportional to their distance}}. In other words, {{the farther they are, the faster they are moving away from [Earth](Earth.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-16,16,290!2024-07-17,17,290!2024-07-09,10,270-->
