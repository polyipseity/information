# Hubble's law

__Hubble's law__, also known as {{the __Hubble–Lemaître law__}}, is {{the observation in [physical cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md) that [galaxies](galaxy.md) are moving away from [Earth](Earth.md) at speeds proportional to their distance}}. In other words, {{the farther they are, the faster they are moving away from [Earth](Earth.md)}}.

## interpretation

The discovery of {{the linear relationship between redshift and distance, coupled with a supposed linear relation between [recessional velocity](recessional%20velocity.md) and redshift}}, yields {{a straightforward mathematical expression for Hubble's law as follows}}: {{$$v=H_{0}\,D$$}}

where

- _v_ is {{the recessional velocity, typically expressed in km/s}}.
- _H_<sub>0</sub> is {{Hubble's constant}} and corresponds to {{the value of _H_ (often termed the __Hubble parameter__ which is a value that is [time dependent](time-variant%20system.md) and which can be expressed in terms of the [scale factor](scale%20factor%20(cosmology).md)) in the Friedmann equations taken at the time of observation denoted by the subscript 0}}. This value is {{the same throughout the universe for a given [comoving time](comoving%20and%20proper%20distances.md#comoving%20coordinates)}}.
- _D_ is {{the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the [comoving distance](comoving%20and%20proper%20distances.md), which is constant) from the [galaxy](galaxy.md) to the observer}}, measured in {{[mega](mega-.md) [parsecs](parsec.md) (Mpc), in the 3-space defined by given [cosmological time](cosmic%20time.md)}}. (Recession velocity is {{just _v_ = _dD/dt_}}.)

Hubble's law is considered {{a fundamental relation between recessional velocity and distance}}. However, the relation between {{recessional velocity and redshift depends on the cosmological model adopted and is not established except for small redshifts}}.

For {{distances _D_ larger than the radius of the [Hubble sphere](hubble%20volume.md) _r_<sub>HS</sub>}}, objects {{recede at a rate faster than the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md)}} (_see_ [uses of the proper distance](comoving%20and%20proper%20distances.md#uses%20of%20the%20proper%20distance) for a discussion of the significance of this): {{$$r_{\text{HS} }={\frac {c}{H_{0} } }$$}}. Since {{the Hubble "constant" is a constant only in space, not in time}}, the radius of the Hubble sphere may {{increase or decrease over various time intervals}}. The subscript '0' {{indicates the value of the Hubble constant today}}. Current evidence suggests that {{the expansion of the universe is accelerating (_see_ [accelerating universe](accelerating%20expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md))}}, meaning that for {{any given galaxy, the recession velocity dD/dt is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances}}; however, the Hubble parameter is {{actually thought to be decreasing with time}}, meaning that if {{we were to look at some fixed distance _D_ and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance}}, {{later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones}}.
