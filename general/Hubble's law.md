# Hubble's law

__Hubble's law__, also known as {{the __Hubble–Lemaître law__}}, is {{the observation in [physical cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md) that [galaxies](galaxy.md) are moving away from [Earth](Earth.md) at speeds proportional to their distance}}. In other words, {{the farther they are, the faster they are moving away from [Earth](Earth.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-21,67,310!2024-09-28,72,310!2024-08-18,40,290-->

## interpretation

The discovery of {{the linear relationship between redshift and distance, coupled with a supposed linear relation between [recessional velocity](recessional%20velocity.md) and redshift}}, yields {{a straightforward mathematical expression for Hubble's law as follows}}: {{$$v=H_{0}\,D$$}} <!--SR:!2024-08-21,10,286!2024-08-27,16,306!2024-08-25,14,306-->

where

- _v_ is {{the recessional velocity, typically expressed in km/s}}.
- _H_<sub>0</sub> is {{Hubble's constant}} and corresponds to {{the value of _H_ (often termed the __Hubble parameter__ which is a value that is [time dependent](time-variant%20system.md) and which can be expressed in terms of the [scale factor](scale%20factor%20(cosmology).md)) in the Friedmann equations taken at the time of observation denoted by the subscript 0}}. This value is {{the same throughout the universe for a given [comoving time](comoving%20and%20proper%20distances.md#comoving%20coordinates)}}.
- _D_ is {{the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the [comoving distance](comoving%20and%20proper%20distances.md), which is constant) from the [galaxy](galaxy.md) to the observer}}, measured in {{[mega](mega-.md) [parsecs](parsec.md) (Mpc), in the 3-space defined by given [cosmological time](cosmic%20time.md)}}. (Recession velocity is {{just _v_ = _dD/dt_}}.) <!--SR:!2024-08-29,18,306!2024-08-28,17,306!2024-08-21,10,286!2024-08-23,12,286!2024-08-25,14,306!2024-08-20,9,286!2024-08-28,17,306-->

Hubble's law is considered {{a fundamental relation between recessional velocity and distance}}. However, the relation between {{recessional velocity and redshift depends on the cosmological model adopted and is not established except for small redshifts}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-26,15,306!2024-08-24,13,286-->

For {{distances _D_ larger than the radius of the [Hubble sphere](hubble%20volume.md) _r_<sub>HS</sub>}}, objects {{recede at a rate faster than the [speed of light](speed%20of%20light.md)}} (_see_ [uses of the proper distance](comoving%20and%20proper%20distances.md#uses%20of%20the%20proper%20distance) for a discussion of the significance of this): {{$$r_{\text{HS} }={\frac {c}{H_{0} } }$$}}. Since {{the Hubble "constant" is a constant only in space, not in time}}, the radius of the Hubble sphere may {{increase or decrease over various time intervals}}. The subscript '0' {{indicates the value of the Hubble constant today}}. Current evidence suggests that {{the expansion of the universe is accelerating (_see_ [accelerating universe](accelerating%20expansion%20of%20the%20universe.md))}}, meaning that for {{any given galaxy, the recession velocity dD/dt is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances}}; however, the Hubble parameter is {{actually thought to be decreasing with time}}, meaning that if {{we were to look at some fixed distance _D_ and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance}}, {{later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-26,15,306!2024-08-27,16,306!2024-08-26,15,306!2024-08-28,17,306!2024-08-26,15,306!2024-08-29,18,306!2024-08-21,10,286!2024-08-21,10,286!2024-08-26,15,306!2024-08-29,18,306!2024-08-24,13,286-->

## units derived from the Hubble constant

### Hubble time

The Hubble constant _H_<sub>0</sub> has units of {{inverse time}}; {{the __Hubble time__ _t<sub>H</sub>_}} is {{simply defined as the inverse of the Hubble constant}}, i.e. {{$$t_{H}\equiv {\frac {1}{H_{0} }}={\frac {1}{67.8\mathrm {~(km/s)/Mpc} } } \approx 4.55\times 10^{17}\mathrm {~s} \approx 14.4{\text{ billion years} }$$}}. This is {{slightly different from the age of the universe, which is approximately 13.8 billion years}}. The Hubble time is {{the age it would have had if the expansion had been linear}}, and {{it is different from the real age of the universe because the expansion is not linear}}; it {{depends on the energy content of the universe}} (see [§ derivation of the Hubble parameter](#derivation%20of%20the%20Hubble%20parameter)).

We currently {{appear to be approaching a period where the expansion of the universe is exponential}} due to {{the increasing dominance of [vacuum energy](vacuum%20energy.md)}}. In this regime, {{the Hubble parameter is constant}}, and {{the universe grows by a factor [_e_](e%20(mathematical%20constant).md) each Hubble time}}: {{$$H\equiv {\frac {\dot {a} }{a} }={\textrm {constant} }\quad \Longrightarrow \quad a\propto e^{Ht}=e^{\frac {t}{t_{H} }}$$}}. Likewise, the generally accepted value of {{2.27 [Es](metric%20prefix.md#List%20of%20SI%20prefixes)<sup>−1</sup>}} means that {{(at the current rate) the universe would grow by a factor of _e_<sup>2.27</sup> in one [exasecond](orders%20of%20magnitude%20(time).md)}}.

Over {{long periods of time}}, the dynamics are {{complicated by general relativity, dark energy, [inflation](cosmic%20inflation.md), etc.}}, as explained above.
