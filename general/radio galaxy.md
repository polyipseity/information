# radio galaxy

A __radio galaxy__ is {{a [galaxy](galaxy.md) with giant regions of radio emission extending well beyond its visible structure}}. These energetic radio lobes are {{powered by jets from its [active galactic nucleus](active%20galactic%20nucleus.md)}}. They have luminosities {{up to 10<sup>39</sup> [W](watt.md) at [radio wavelengths](radio%20wave.md) between 10 MHz and 100 GHz}}. The radio emission is due to {{the [synchrotron process](synchrotron%20radiation.md)}}. The observed structure in radio emission is {{determined by the interaction between twin [jets](astrophysical%20jet.md#relativistic%20jet) and the external medium, modified by the effects of [relativistic beaming](relativistic%20beaming.md)}}. The [host galaxies](active%20galactic%20nucleus.md) are {{almost exclusively large [elliptical galaxies](elliptical%20galaxy.md)}}. {{_Radio-loud_ active galaxies}} can be {{detected at large distances, making them valuable tools for [observational cosmology](observational%20cosmology.md)}}. Recently, much work has been done on {{the effects of these objects on the [intergalactic medium](warmâ€“hot%20intergalactic%20medium.md), particularly in [galaxy groups and clusters](galaxy%20groups%20and%20clusters.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-24,4,230!2024-08-29,9,250!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-08-31,11,270!2024-08-21,4,270!2024-09-02,13,270-->
