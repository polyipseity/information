# axial tilt

In [astronomy](astronomy.md), __axial tilt__, also known as {{__obliquity__}}, is {{the [angle](angle.md) between an object's [rotational axis](rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis.md) and its [orbital](orbit.md) axis, which is the line perpendicular to its [orbital plane](orbital%20plane.md)}}; equivalently, {{it is the angle between its [equatorial plane](equator.md) and orbital plane}}.
