# sensitivity and specificity

## definition

### sensitivity

Sensitivity, is also called {{recall, true positive rate, or detection rate in a clinical setting}}. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: {{$$\text{sensitivity} = \frac {\text{TP} } {\text{TP} + \text{FN} }$$}}, where {{TP are true positives and FN are false negatives (see [false positives and false negatives](false%20positives%20and%20false%20negatives.md))}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-05,51,250!2024-09-11,68,310!2025-02-19,189,310-->

### specificity

Specificity, is also called {{selectivity or true negative rate}}. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: {{$$\text{specificity} = \frac {\text{TN} } {\text{TN} + \text{FP} }$$}}, where {{TN are true negatives and FP are false positives (see [false positives and false negatives](false%20positives%20and%20false%20negatives.md))}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-07,121,290!2024-09-10,68,310!2024-11-12,108,290-->
