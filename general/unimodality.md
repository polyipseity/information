# unimodality

In [mathematics](mathematics.md), __unimodality__ means {{possessing a unique [mode](mode%20(statistics).md)}}. More generally, unimodality means there is {{only a single highest value, somehow defined, of some [mathematical object](mathematical%20object.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-19,61,310!2025-04-15,172,310-->

## unimodal probability distribution

In [statistics](statistics.md), a __unimodal probability distribution__ or __unimodal distribution__ is {{a [probability distribution](probability%20distribution.md) which has a single peak}}. The term "mode" in this context {{refers to any peak of the distribution, not just to the strict definition of [mode](mode%20(statistics).md) which is usual in statistics}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-19,115,290!2025-06-26,229,330-->

If {{there is a single mode}}, the distribution function is called {{"unimodal"}}. If {{it has more modes}} it is {{"bimodal" (2), "trimodal" (3), etc., or in general, "[multimodal](multimodal%20distribution.md)"}}. {{The common [normal distributions](normal%20distribution.md)}} is unimodal. Other examples of unimodal distributions include {{[Cauchy distribution](Cauchy%20distribution.md), [Student's _t_-distribution](Student's%20t-distribution.md), [chi-squared distribution](chi-squared%20distribution.md) and [exponential distribution](exponential%20distribution.md)}}. Among {{discrete distributions}}, {{the [binomial distribution](binomial%20distribution.md) and [Poisson distribution](poisson%20distribution.md)}} can be seen as unimodal, though {{for some parameters they can have two adjacent values with the same probability}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-10,54,310!2024-11-18,60,310!2024-11-23,62,310!2024-11-14,56,310!2024-11-28,67,310!2024-11-10,49,290!2025-04-08,162,310!2025-04-11,166,310!2024-11-24,63,310-->
