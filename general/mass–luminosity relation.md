# mass–luminosity relation

In [astrophysics](astrophysics.md), the __mass–luminosity relation__ is {@{an equation giving the relationship between a [star](star.md)'s [mass](mass.md) and its [luminosity](luminosity.md), first noted by [Jakob Karl Ernst Halm](Jakob%20Karl%20Ernst%20Halm.md)}@}. The relationship is represented by the equation: {@{$$\frac L {L_\odot} = C \left(\frac M {M_\odot} \right)^a$$}@}, where {@{_L_<sub>⊙</sub> and _M_<sub>⊙</sub> are the luminosity and mass of the [Sun](Sun.md)}@}, and {@{$C$ and $1 \le a \le 6$ are two constants}@}. The value {@{_a_ = 3.5}@} is commonly used for {@{[main-sequence stars](main%20sequence.md) of [mass](stellar%20mass.md) in between 2 _M_<sub>⊙</sub> and 55 _M_<sub>⊙</sub>}@}, and does not apply to {@{[red giants](red%20giant.md) or [white dwarfs](white%20dwarf.md)}@}. As a star {@{approaches the [Eddington luminosity](Eddington%20luminosity.md)}@} then {@{_a_ = 1}@}.

In summary, the relations for stars with different ranges of mass are, to a good approximation, as the following:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{L}{L_{\odot} } & \approx 0.23\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot} }\right)^{2.3}   & (M \le 0.43M_{\odot}) \\
\frac{L}{L_{\odot} } & \approx \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot} }\right)^4 &     (0.43M_{\odot} \le M \le 2M_{\odot}) \\
\frac{L}{L_{\odot} } & \approx 1.4\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot} }\right)^{3.5}   & (2M_{\odot} \le M \le 55M_{\odot}) \\
\frac{L}{L_{\odot} } & \approx 32000 \frac{M}{M_{\odot} } & (M \ge 55M_{\odot})
\end{aligned}$$

- mass thresholds ::@:: $0.43M_\odot, 2M_\odot, 55M_\odot$
- $M \le 0.43M_{\odot}$ ::@:: $a = 2.3, C = 0.23$
- $0.43M_{\odot} \le M \le 2M_{\odot}$ ::@:: $a = 4, C = 1$
- $2M_{\odot} \le M \le 55M_{\odot}$ ::@:: $a = 3.5, C = 1.4$
- $M \ge 55M_{\odot}$ ::@:: $a = 1, C = 32\,000$

The mass/luminosity relationship can also be used to {@{determine the lifetime of [stars](star.md)}@} by {@{noting that lifetime is approximately proportional to _M_/_L_}@} although {@{one finds that more massive stars have shorter lifetimes than that which the _M_/_L_ relationship predicts}@}. A more sophisticated calculation factors in {@{a star's [loss of mass](stellar%20mass%20loss.md) over [time](time.md)}@}.
