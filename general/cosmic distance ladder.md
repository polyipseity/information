# cosmic distance ladder

The __cosmic distance ladder__ (also known as {{the __extragalactic distance scale__}}) is {{the succession of methods by which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects}}. {{A _direct_ distance measurement of an astronomical object}} is possible only for {{those objects that are "close enough" (within about a thousand [parsecs](parsec.md)) to Earth}}. The techniques for determining distances to {{more distant objects}} are all based on {{various measured correlations between methods that work at close distances and methods that work at larger distances}}. Several methods rely on {{a standard candle, which is an astronomical object that has a known [luminosity](luminosity.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-03,69,310!2024-09-22,33,270!2024-10-30,65,310!2024-09-21,33,270!2024-09-27,39,290!2024-10-06,39,250!2024-09-26,38,270-->

## direct measurement

At the base of the ladder are {{_fundamental_ distance measurements, in which distances are determined directly, with no physical assumptions about the nature of the object in question}}. The precise measurement of stellar positions is part of {{the discipline of [astrometry](astrometry.md)}}. Early fundamental distances—such as {{the radii of the earth, moon and sun, and the distances between them}}—were {{well estimated with very low technology by the ancient Greeks}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-04,70,310!2024-10-25,63,310!2024-10-19,58,310!2024-10-13,50,290-->

### astronomical unit

- see: [astronomical unit](astronomical%20unit.md)

Direct distance measurements are based {{upon the astronomical unit (AU), which is defined as the mean distance between the [Earth](Earth.md) and the [Sun](Sun.md)}}. [Kepler's laws](Kepler's%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion.md) provide {{precise [ratios](ratio.md) of the orbit sizes of objects orbiting the Sun, but provide no measurement of the overall scale of the orbit system}}. {{[Radar](radar.md)}} is used to {{measure the distance between the orbits of the Earth and of a second body}}. From {{that measurement and the ratio of the two orbit sizes}}, the size of Earth's orbit is {{calculated}}. The Earth's orbit is known with an absolute precision of {{a few meters}} and a relative precision of {{a few parts in 100 billion (1×10<sup>−11</sup>)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-05,71,310!2024-10-08,50,290!2024-10-25,62,310!2024-09-10,27,270!2024-10-09,47,290!2024-09-18,32,290!2024-10-21,59,310!2024-10-02,44,290-->

Historically, {{observations of [Venus transits](Transit%20of%20Venus.md#scientific%20interest%20in%20transits)}} were crucial in determining the AU; in {{the first half of the 20th century}}, {{observations of [asteroids](asteroid.md)}} were also important. Presently the orbit of Earth is determined with high precision using {{[radar](radar.md) measurements of distances to Venus and other nearby planets and asteroids, and by tracking interplanetary spacecraft in their orbits around the Sun through the [Solar System](Solar%20System.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-09,46,290!2024-09-15,32,270!2024-09-27,36,290!2024-10-24,57,270-->

### parallax

- see: [parallax in astronomy](parallax%20in%20astronomy.md)

The most important fundamental [distance measurements](length%20measurement.md) in [astronomy](astronomy.md) come from {{trigonometric [parallax](parallax.md), as applied in the _[stellar parallax method](stellar%20parallax.md#method)_}}. As {{the Earth orbits the Sun}}, the position of nearby stars will {{appear to shift slightly against the more distant background}}. These shifts are {{angles in an [isosceles triangle](isosceles%20triangle.md), with 2 [AU](astronomical%20unit.md) (the distance between the extreme positions of Earth's orbit around the Sun) making the base leg of the triangle and the distance to the star being the long equal-length legs}}. The amount of shift is {{quite small, even for the nearest stars, measuring 1 [arcsecond](minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc.md) for an object at 1 parsec's distance (3.26 [light-years](light-year.md))}}, and thereafter {{decreasing in angular amount as the distance increases}}. Astronomers usually express distances in {{units of _[parsecs](parsec.md)_ (parallax arcseconds); light-years are used in popular media}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-03,44,290!2024-11-02,68,310!2024-10-16,55,310!2024-10-14,53,310!2024-10-13,52,310!2024-10-06,43,290!2024-10-20,58,310-->

## standard candles

{{Almost all astronomical objects used as physical distance indicators}} belong to {{a class that has a known brightness}}. By {{comparing this known [luminosity](luminosity.md) to an object's observed brightness}}, the distance to the object can be {{computed using the [inverse-square law](inverse-square%20law.md)}}. These objects of known brightness are {{termed __standard candles__, coined by [Henrietta Swan Leavitt](Henrietta%20Swan%20Leavitt.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-10,47,290!2024-10-06,49,290!2024-09-16,30,270!2024-10-27,64,310!2024-11-26,82,290-->

The brightness of an object can be expressed {{in terms of its [absolute magnitude](absolute%20magnitude.md)}}. This quantity is derived from {{the logarithm of its luminosity as seen from a distance of 10 parsecs}}. The [apparent magnitude](apparent%20magnitude.md), {{the magnitude as seen by the observer}} (an instrument called {{a [bolometer](bolometer.md)}} is used), can be measured and {{used with the absolute magnitude to calculate the distance _d_ to the object in parsecs as follows}}: {{$$5 \cdot \log_{10} d = m − M + 5$$ or $$d = 10^{(m − M + 5) / 5}$$}}, where {{_m_ is the apparent magnitude, and _M_ the absolute magnitude}}. For this to be accurate, {{both magnitudes must be in the same frequency band and there can be no relative motion in the radial direction}}. {{Some means of correcting for interstellar [extinction](extinction%20(astronomy).md), which also makes objects appear fainter and more red}}, is needed, especially if {{the object lies within a dusty or gaseous region}}. The difference between an object's absolute and apparent magnitudes is {{called its [distance modulus](distance%20modulus.md)}}, and {{astronomical distances, especially intergalactic ones}}, are {{sometimes tabulated in this way}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-16,31,270!2024-10-06,47,290!2024-10-21,60,310!2024-10-21,59,310!2024-09-22,34,270!2024-09-29,41,290!2024-11-05,71,310!2024-09-06,21,250!2024-09-24,37,290!2024-11-08,67,270!2024-10-26,64,310!2024-09-17,30,270!2024-09-20,32,270-->

## galactic distance indicators

### main sequence fitting

- see: [spectroscopic parallax](spectroscopic%20parallax.md)

When {{the absolute magnitude for a group of stars}} is {{plotted against the [spectral classification](stellar%20classification.md) of the star, in a [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](Hertzsprung–Russell%20diagram.md)}}, evolutionary patterns are found that {{relate to the mass, age and composition of the star}}. In particular, during {{their hydrogen burning period}}, stars {{lie along a curve in the diagram called the [main sequence](main%20sequence.md)}}. By {{measuring these properties from a star's spectrum}}, {{the position of a main sequence star on the H–R diagram}} can be determined, and thereby {{the star's absolute magnitude estimated}}. A comparison of this value with {{the apparent magnitude allows the approximate distance to be determined}}, after {{correcting for interstellar extinction of the luminosity because of gas and dust}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-19,81,335!2024-10-18,53,315!2024-11-15,77,335!2024-10-04,43,315!2024-10-10,48,315!2024-11-08,72,335!2024-10-19,52,315!2024-10-20,52,315!2024-09-21,29,295!2024-10-21,56,315-->

In {{a gravitationally-bound [star cluster](star%20cluster.md) such as the [Hyades](hyades%20(star%20cluster).md)}}, the stars {{formed at approximately the same age and lie at the same distance}}. This allows {{relatively accurate main sequence fitting, providing both age and distance determination}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-10,73,335!2024-10-24,55,315!2024-09-26,34,295-->

## extragalactic distance indicators

### supernovae

#### type Ia light curves

[Type Ia supernovae](Type%20Ia%20supernova.md) are {{some of the best ways to determine extragalactic distances}}. Ia's occur when {{a binary white dwarf star begins to accrete matter from its companion star}}. As the white dwarf gains matter, eventually {{it reaches its [Chandrasekhar limit](Chandrasekhar%20limit.md) of $1.4M_{\odot }$}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-20,55,315!2024-09-24,33,295!2024-11-09,72,335-->

Once reached, the star becomes {{unstable and undergoes a runaway nuclear fusion reaction}}. Because {{all Type Ia supernovae explode at about the same mass}}, {{their absolute magnitudes are all the same}}. This makes them {{very useful as standard candles}}. All Type Ia supernovae {{have a standard blue and visual magnitude of $$M_{B}\approx M_{V}\approx -19.3\pm 0.3$$}}. Therefore, when observing a Type Ia supernova, if {{it is possible to determine what its peak magnitude was}}, then {{its distance can be calculated}}. It is {{not intrinsically necessary to capture the supernova directly at its peak magnitude}}; using {{the __multicolor light curve shape__ method (__MLCS__)}}, the shape of the light curve (taken {{at any reasonable time after the initial explosion}}) is {{compared to a family of parameterized curves that will determine the absolute magnitude at the maximum brightness}}. This method also {{takes into effect interstellar extinction/dimming from dust and gas}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-02,41,315!2024-10-17,50,315!2024-10-05,43,315!2024-10-26,57,315!2024-09-18,27,295!2024-10-05,44,315!2024-11-01,65,335!2024-11-15,77,335!2024-10-04,39,295!2024-10-07,45,315!2024-09-23,31,295!2024-10-08,46,315-->
