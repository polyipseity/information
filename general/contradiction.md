# contradiction

In [traditional logic](term%20logic.md), a __contradiction__ occurs when {{a [proposition](proposition.md) conflicts either with itself or established [fact](fact.md)}}. It is often used as a tool to {{detect [disingenuous](deception.md) beliefs and [bias](bias.md)}}. Illustrating a general tendency in applied logic, {{[Aristotle](aristotle.md)'s [law of noncontradiction](law%20of%20noncontradiction.md)}} states that {{"It is impossible that the same thing can at the same time both belong and not belong to the same object and in the same respect."}} <!--SR:!2024-12-08,68,310!2024-11-24,57,310!2024-11-27,60,310!2024-11-15,45,290-->

In {{modern [formal logic](logic.md#formal%20logic) and [type theory](type%20theory.md)}}, the term is {{mainly used instead for a _single_ proposition, often denoted by the [falsum](up%20tack.md) symbol [$\bot$](bottom%20type.md)}}; a proposition is a contradiction if {{[false](false%20(logic).md) can be derived from it, using the rules of the logic}}. It is a proposition that is {{unconditionally false (i.e., a self-contradictory proposition)}}. This can be generalized to {{a collection of propositions, which is then said to "contain" a contradiction}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-12,112,290!2024-12-05,65,310!2025-04-03,150,310!2025-04-21,169,310!2024-11-21,55,310-->
