# design thinking

## as a process of designing

## as a process for innovation

### empathy

- see: [empathic design](empathic%20design.md)

### ideation: divergent and convergent thinking

Ideation consists of {{alternation between [divergent](divergent%20thinking.md) and [convergent thinking](convergent%20thinking.md)}}. <!--SR:!2025-06-03,301,330-->

Divergent thinking is supposed to {{enhance creativity of thinkers}}. During divergent thinking, having {{a diverse group of people}} involved is important. Good practice is {{encouraging people to go wild with many ideas, and avoiding evaluation}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-17,192,310!2025-06-08,304,330!2025-01-21,182,310-->

Convergent thinking is supposed to {{find the best and the most concrete solution}}. <!--SR:!2025-01-19,192,310-->

## applications

### in business

Design thinking can integrate {{human values like usability and desirability, technology feasibility, and business viability}} together for innovation. Innovation depends on {{the context. For example, commercialization of creative ideas is the definition for venture capitalists}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-16,132,270!2025-04-09,256,330-->

User desirability describes {{how much people want the product, depending on their needs and desires}}. This can be achieved by {{deeply understanding users via an empathetic design process, such as putting ourselves in the shoes of the customers}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-08,80,270!2024-08-23,73,270-->

Technology feasibility describes {{the possibility of producing a product within allocated budget and time}}. Three important factors to consider are {{science and engineering, money, and time}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-30,127,290!2025-03-26,247,330-->

Business viability describes {{how the business can survive}}. The three important factors to consider are {{competition, market size, and target audience}}. <!--SR:!2025-03-25,229,290!2024-09-01,75,270-->

The three factors above are {{interdependent and must be balanced for a successful business}}. Deep understanding of {{the business model, market, and technology}} is required. <!--SR:!2025-04-28,255,290!2025-01-05,155,270-->

Design thinking can be used in {{design conceptualization}}. It is the {{most important stage of product development}} because it is {{at the start of the product development and requires the least effort, so it produces the highest rate of return}}. The rate of return decreases along the stages as {{mistakes in later stages become much more costly}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-17,142,290!2025-01-03,176,310!2024-11-01,121,290!2024-10-19,118,290-->

During ideation, we can use divergent and convergent thinking to {{find the right problem (from many pains to a problem), and then find the right solution (from many solutions to few prototypes)}}, but {{do not mix these processes}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-13,123,270!2025-03-06,213,310-->
