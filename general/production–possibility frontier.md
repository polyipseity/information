# production–possibility frontier

In [microeconomics](microeconomics.md), a __production–possibility frontier__ (__PPF__), __production possibility curve__ (__PPC__), or __production possibility boundary__ (__PPB__) is {@{a [graphical representation](graphic%20communication.md#graphical%20representation) showing all the possible options of output for two [goods](goods.md) that can be [produced](production%20(economics).md) using all [factors of production](factors%20of%20production.md)}@}, where {@{the given resources are fully and efficiently utilized per unit time}@}. A PPF illustrates {@{several economic concepts}@}, such as {@{[allocative efficiency](allocative%20efficiency.md), [economies of scale](economies%20of%20scale.md), [opportunity cost](opportunity%20cost.md) (or marginal rate of transformation), [productive efficiency](productive%20efficiency.md), and [scarcity](scarcity.md) of resources (the [fundamental economic problem](economic%20problem.md) that all societies face)}@}.<sup>[\[1\]](#^ref-1)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-09,55,310!2025-01-05,71,290!2024-12-22,68,310!2024-12-20,53,250-->

This tradeoff is usually considered for {@{an [economy](economy.md), but also applies to each individual, household, and economic organization}@}. One good can only be produced by {@{diverting resources from other goods, and so by producing less of them}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-09,55,310!2024-12-29,73,310-->

{@{Graphically bounding the [production set](production%20set.md)}@} for {@{fixed input quantities}@}, the PPF curve shows {@{the maximum possible production level of one commodity for any given production level of the other, given the existing state of technology}@}. By doing so, it {@{defines [productive efficiency](productive%20efficiency.md) in the context of that production set}@}: {@{a point on the frontier indicates efficient use of the available inputs (such as points B, D and C in the graph), a point beneath the curve (such as A) indicates inefficiency, and a point beyond the curve (such as X) indicates impossibility}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-22,68,310!2025-04-13,150,310!2025-05-19,177,310!2024-12-09,55,310!2024-12-14,60,310-->

PPFs are normally {@{drawn as bulging upwards or outwards from the origin ("concave" when viewed from the origin)}@}, but {@{they can be represented as bulging downward (inwards) or linear (straight), depending on a number of assumptions}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-29,73,310!2024-12-17,63,310-->

{@{An outward shift of the PPC}@} results from {@{growth of the availability of inputs}@}, such as {@{[physical capital](physical%20capital.md) or [labour](work%20(human%20activity).md), or from technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs}@}. Such a shift reflects, for instance, {@{[economic growth](economic%20growth.md) of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF)}@}, which means that {@{more of _both_ outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good}@}. Conversely, {@{the PPF will shift inward}@} if {@{the labour force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a [natural disaster](natural%20disaster.md) decreases the stock of physical capital}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-27,72,310!2024-12-14,60,310!2025-05-03,160,310!2024-12-09,55,310!2024-12-09,55,310!2024-12-14,60,310!2024-12-22,68,310-->

However, {@{most [economic contractions](recession.md)}@} reflect {@{not that less can be produced but that the economy has started operating below the frontier}@}, as typically, {@{both labour and physical capital are [underemployed](underemployment.md), remaining therefore idle}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-17,63,310!2024-12-17,63,310!2024-12-27,72,310-->

In {@{[microeconomics](microeconomics.md)}@}, the PPF shows {@{the options open to an individual, [household](household%20production%20function.md), or firm in a two-good world}@}. By definition, {@{each point on the curve is productively efficient}@}, but, {@{given the nature of [market demand](supply%20and%20demand.md), some points will be more [profitable](profit%20(accounting).md) than others}@}. Equilibrium for a firm will be {@{the combination of outputs on the PPF that is most profitable}@}.<sup>[\[2\]](#^ref-2)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-09,55,310!2024-12-17,63,310!2025-04-21,156,310!2024-12-14,60,310!2024-12-22,68,310-->

From {@{a [macroeconomic](macroeconomics.md) perspective}@}, the PPF illustrates {@{the production possibilities available to a nation or [economy](economy.md) during a given period of time for broad categories of output}@}. It is traditionally used to {@{show the movement between committing all funds to consumption on the _y_-axis versus investment on the _x_-axis}@}. However, an economy may {@{achieve [productive efficiency](productive%20efficiency.md) without necessarily being [allocatively efficient](allocative%20efficiency.md)}@}. {@{Market failure (such as imperfect competition or [externalities](externality.md)) and some institutions of social decision-making (such as government and tradition)}@} may lead to {@{the wrong combination of goods being produced (hence the wrong mix of resources being allocated between producing the two goods)}@} compared to {@{what consumers would prefer, given what is feasible on the PPF}@}.<sup>[\[3\]](#^ref-3)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-09,55,310!2025-03-14,119,290!2025-04-11,143,310!2024-12-09,55,310!2025-06-22,200,310!2025-01-30,91,290!2025-06-05,191,310-->

The two main determinants of the position of the PPF at any given time are {@{the state of [technology](technology.md) and management expertise (which are reflected in the available [production functions](production%20function.md)) and the available quantities of [factors of production](factors%20of%20production.md) (materials, direct labor, and factory overhead)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-15,78,270-->

{@{Only points on or within a PPF}@} are {@{actually possible to achieve in the short run}@}. In {@{the long run}@}, if {@{technology improves or if the supply of factors of production increases}@}, {@{the economy's capacity to produce both goods increases}@}; if {@{this potential is realized}@}, {@{[economic growth](economic%20growth.md) occurs}@}. That increase is shown by {@{a shift of the production-possibility frontier to the right}@}. Conversely, {@{a natural, military or ecological disaster}@} might {@{move the PPF to the left in response to a reduction in an economy's productive capability}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> Thus {@{all points on or within the curve}@} are {@{part of the [production set](production%20set.md): combinations of goods that the economy could potentially produce}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-22,68,310!2024-12-27,72,310!2024-12-14,60,310!2024-12-14,60,310!2024-12-22,68,310!2025-05-05,162,310!2024-12-17,63,310!2024-12-17,63,310!2024-12-17,63,310!2024-12-09,55,310!2024-12-17,63,310!2024-12-17,63,310-->

If {@{the two production goods depicted are [capital](capital%20(economics).md) [investment](investment.md#in%20economics%20or%20macroeconomics) (to increase future production possibilities) and current consumption goods}@}, {@{the higher the investment this year, the more the PPF would shift out in following years}@}.<sup>[\[5\]](#^ref-5)</sup> Shifts of the curve can represent how {@{technological progress that favors production possibilities of one good, say guns, more than the other}@} shifts {@{the PPF outwards more along the favored good's axis, "biasing" production possibilities in that direction}@}. Similarly, if {@{one good makes more use of say capital and if capital grows faster than other factors}@}, growth possibilities might be {@{biased in favor of the capital-intensive good}@}. Also a shift in the PPF could depict that {@{there's an improvement in technology or good use of capital goods}@}.<sup>[\[6\]](#^ref-6)</sup><sup>[\[7\]](#^ref-7)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-04-24,157,310!2025-04-04,143,310!2025-04-19,155,310!2025-05-02,159,310!2025-06-28,206,310!2024-12-22,68,310!2024-12-27,72,310-->

Production-Possibility Frontier delineates {@{the maximum amount/quantities of outputs (goods/services) an economy can achieve}@}, given {@{fixed resources ([factors of production](factors%20of%20production.md)) and fixed technological progress}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-27,72,310!2025-06-24,202,310-->

- Points that lie either on or below the production possibilities frontier/curve are ::@:: __possible/attainable__: the quantities can be produced with currently available resources and technology. <!--SR:!2024-12-09,55,310!2025-06-22,201,310-->
- Points that lie above the production possibilities frontier/curve are ::@:: __not possible/unattainable__ because the quantities cannot be produced using currently available resources and technology. <!--SR:!2024-12-09,55,310!2024-12-14,60,310-->
- Points that lie strictly below the frontier/curve are ::@:: __inefficient__, because the economy can produce more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good, with existing resources and technology. <!--SR:!2024-12-27,72,310!2024-12-17,63,310-->
- Points that lie on the frontier/curve are ::@::[__efficient__](economic%20efficiency.md). <!--SR:!2024-12-14,60,310!2024-12-09,55,310-->

Points that are unattainable can be {@{achieved through [external trade](international%20trade.md) and [economic growth](economic%20growth.md)}@}. Examples include {@{importations of resources and technology, and the increase in the production of goods and services}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-27,72,310!2024-12-22,68,310-->

Specifically, at {@{all points on the frontier}@}, the economy achieves {@{[productive efficiency](productive%20efficiency.md): no more output of any good can be achieved from the given inputs without sacrificing output of some good}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-09,55,310!2024-12-22,68,310-->

Some [productive efficient](productive%20efficiency.md) points are {@{[Pareto efficient](pareto%20efficiency.md): impossible to find any trade that will make no consumer worse off}@}. Pareto efficiency is achieved when {@{the [marginal rate of transformation](#marginal%20rate%20of%20transformation) (slope of the frontier/opportunity cost of goods) is equal to all consumers' [marginal rate of substitution](marginal%20rate%20of%20substitution.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-20,199,310!2024-12-29,73,310-->

Similarly, not all Pareto efficient points on the frontier are {@{[allocative efficient](allocative%20efficiency.md). Allocative efficient is only achieved when the economy produces at quantities that match societal preference}@}. <!--SR:!2025-04-18,148,310-->

A PPF typically takes the form of the curve illustrated above. {@{An economy that is operating on the PPF}@} is {@{said to be [efficient](economic%20efficiency.md), meaning that it would be impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good}@}. In contrast, if {@{the economy is operating below the curve}@}, it is {@{said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods}@} or {@{some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-27,72,310!2025-05-01,163,310!2024-12-17,63,310!2024-12-22,68,310!2025-05-06,163,310-->

For example, if one assumes that {@{the economy's available quantities of [factors of production](factors%20of%20production.md) do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur}@}, if {@{the economy is operating on the PPF}@}, production of guns would {@{need to be sacrificed to produce more butter}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> If {@{production is efficient}@}, the economy can {@{choose between combinations (points) on the PPF}@}: _B_ if guns are of interest, _C_ if more butter is needed, _D_ if an equal mix of butter and guns is required.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-04-09,141,310!2024-12-09,55,310!2024-12-29,73,310!2024-12-14,60,310!2024-12-09,55,310-->

In the PPF, {@{all points _on_ the curve}@} are {@{points of maximum [productive efficiency](productive%20efficiency.md) (no more output of any good can be achieved from the given inputs without sacrificing output of some good)}@}; {@{all points inside the frontier (such as _A_)}@} can {@{be produced but are productively _inefficient_}@}; {@{all points outside the curve (such as _X_)}@} cannot {@{be produced with the given, existing resources}@}.<sup>[\[8\]](#^ref-8)</sup> Not all points on the curve are {@{[Pareto efficient](pareto%20efficiency.md), however}@}; only {@{in the case where the [marginal rate of transformation](#marginal%20rate%20of%20transformation) is equal to all consumers' [marginal rate of substitution](marginal%20rate%20of%20substitution.md)}@} and hence {@{equal to the ratio of prices will it be impossible to find any trade that will make no consumer worse off}@}.<sup>[\[9\]](#^ref-9)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-09,55,310!2024-12-29,73,310!2024-12-14,60,310!2024-12-17,63,310!2025-03-23,133,310!2025-04-19,149,310!2024-12-14,60,310!2025-04-03,142,310!2025-06-25,203,310-->

{@{Any point that lies either on the production possibilities curve or to the left of it}@} is {@{said to be an __attainable point__: it can be produced with currently available resources}@}. {@{Points that lie to the right of the production possibilities curve}@} are {@{said to be __unattainable__ because they cannot be produced using currently available resources}@}. {@{Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve}@} are {@{said to be __inefficient__, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good}@}. {@{An __efficient point__}@} is {@{one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other}@}. <sup>[\[10\]](#^ref-10)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-22,68,310!2025-05-05,168,310!2025-02-16,104,290!2024-12-09,55,310!2024-12-17,63,310!2025-04-15,150,310!2025-05-07,164,310!2024-12-09,55,310-->

### marginal rate of transformation

{@{The slope of the production–possibility frontier (PPF) at any given point}@} is {@{called the marginal rate of transformation (__MRT__)}@}. The [slope](slope.md) defines {@{the rate at which [production](manufacturing.md) of one good can be redirected (by reallocation of productive resources) into production of the other}@}. It is also called {@{the (marginal) "opportunity cost" of a commodity, that is, it is the opportunity cost of _X_ in terms of _Y_ at the margin}@}. It measures {@{how much of good _Y_ is given up for one more unit of good _X_ or vice versa}@}. The shape of a PPF is commonly {@{drawn as concave to the origin to represent increasing opportunity cost with increased output of a good}@}. Thus, {@{MRT increases in absolute size as one moves from the top left of the PPF to the bottom right of the PPF}@}.<sup>[\[11\]](#^ref-11)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-27,72,310!2024-12-22,68,310!2025-04-08,140,310!2024-12-27,72,310!2024-12-27,72,310!2025-04-21,151,310!2024-12-09,55,310-->

The marginal rate of transformation can be {@{expressed in terms of either commodity}@}. The marginal opportunity costs of guns in terms of butter is {@{simply the reciprocal of the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns}@}. If, for example, {@{the (absolute) slope at point _BB_ in the diagram is equal to 2}@}, to produce one more packet of butter, {@{the production of 2 guns must be sacrificed}@}. If at _AA_, {@{the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns is equal to 0.25}@}, the sacrifice of one gun could {@{produce four packets of butter}@}, and {@{the opportunity cost of guns in terms of butter is 4}@}. <!--SR:!2025-06-21,199,310!2024-12-27,72,310!2024-12-17,63,310!2024-12-22,68,310!2024-12-22,68,310!2025-06-27,205,310!2024-12-14,60,310-->

The production-possibility frontier can be constructed from {@{the contract curve in an [Edgeworth production box](Edgeworth%20box.md) diagram of factor intensity}@}.<sup>[\[12\]](#^ref-12)</sup> The example used above (which demonstrates {@{increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin}@}) is {@{the most common form of PPF}@}.<sup>[\[13\]](#^ref-13)</sup> It represents {@{a disparity, in the [factor](Heckscher–Ohlin%20theorem.md) intensities and technologies of the two production sectors}@}. That is, as {@{an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point _B_ to point _D_)}@}, {@{the opportunity cost of producing that product increases}@}, because {@{we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it}@}. With {@{increasing production of butter}@}, workers from {@{the gun industry will move to it}@}. At first, {@{the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter}@}, and {@{moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small}@}. However, {@{the cost of producing successive units of butter will increase}@} as {@{resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry}@}.<sup>[\[14\]](#^ref-14)</sup> <!--SR:!2025-01-23,79,270!2024-12-27,72,310!2024-12-22,68,310!2025-06-19,198,310!2024-12-22,68,310!2024-12-27,72,310!2024-12-27,72,310!2024-12-14,60,310!2024-12-14,60,310!2024-12-17,63,310!2024-12-09,55,310!2024-12-14,60,310!2025-05-15,174,310-->

With {@{varying returns to scale}@}, however, {@{it may not be entirely linear in either case}@}.<sup>[\[16\]](#^ref-16)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-17,63,310!2024-12-22,68,310!2024-12-29,73,310!2024-12-22,68,310!2024-12-29,73,310!2024-12-14,60,310!2025-05-02,164,310!2024-12-09,55,310!2025-04-26,143,290!2024-12-22,68,310!2024-12-17,63,310-->

With {@{[economies of scale](economies%20of%20scale.md)}@}, the PPF would {@{curve inward, with the opportunity cost of one good falling as more of it is produced}@}. {@{Specialization in producing successive units of a good}@} determines {@{its opportunity cost (say from [mass production](mass%20production.md) methods or [specialization of labor](division%20of%20labour.md))}@}.<sup>[\[17\]](#^ref-17)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-29,73,310!2025-04-19,142,290!2025-03-12,123,290!2024-12-22,68,310-->

From {@{a starting point on the frontier}@}, if {@{there is no increase in productive resources}@}, increasing the production of a first good entails {@{decreasing the production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second}@}. Points along the curve describe {@{the tradeoff between the goods}@}. The sacrifice in the production of the second good is {@{called the _opportunity cost_ (because increasing production of the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second)}@}. Opportunity cost is {@{measured in the number of units of the second good forgone for one or more units of the first good}@}.<sup>[\[4\]](#^ref-4)</sup> <!--SR:!2024-12-14,60,310!2024-12-27,72,310!2025-06-23,201,310!2024-12-17,63,310!2024-12-14,60,310!2025-06-20,199,310-->

In the context of a PPF, opportunity cost is {@{directly related to the shape of the curve (see above)}@}. If {@{the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line}@}, the opportunity cost is {@{constant as the production of different goods is changing}@}. But, opportunity cost usually {@{will vary depending on the start and end points}@}. In Figure 7, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from _A_ to _B_). At point _C_, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from _C_ to _D_). {@{The ratio of gains to losses}@} is determined by {@{the _marginal rate of transformation_}@}. <!--SR:!2024-12-29,73,310!2024-12-22,68,310!2024-12-22,68,310!2024-12-29,73,310!2024-12-17,63,310!2024-12-17,63,310-->
