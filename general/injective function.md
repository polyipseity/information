# injective function

In [mathematics](mathematics.md), an __injective function__, also known as __injection__ or __one-to-one function__, is {{a [function](function.md) $f$ that maps distinct elements of its [domain](domain%20of%20a%20function.md) to distinct elements, i.e. $x_1 \ne x_2$ implies $f(x_1) \ne f(x_2)$. Equivalently, $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ implies $x_1 = x_2$ in its [contrapositive](contraposition.md) statement.}}.
