# _Q_ factor

The _Q_ factor also describes the sharpness of [resonance](resonance.md) curves {{on a motional spectrum, i.e. [resonance transmissibility](transmissibility%20(vibration).md) $G(\omega_d)$ over frequency ratio $\omega_d / \omega_n$. Higher _Q_ factor indicates that the resonance curve is sharper}}.
