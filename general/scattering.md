# scattering

__Scattering__ describes {@{a wide range of physical processes where moving [particle](particle.md) or [radiation](radiation.md) deviates from a straight [trajectory](trajectory.md)}@}.

## experiments

Scattering experiments are important in {@{discovering new particles}@} and {@{studying structure of particles}@}. Examples include {@{the [Geiger–Marsden experiments](Geiger–Marsden%20experiments.md)}@}. {@{[Laws of physics](laws%20of%20physics.md)}@} are employed in analysis.
