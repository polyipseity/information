# neural network

Advantages of neural network include {{highly parallel, making it suitable for parallel processing, and fault tolerance, in which small number of broken neurons degrade the model only slightly}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-20,49,310-->

## models

### artificial neurons

ANNs are composed of {{[artificial neurons](artificial%20neuron.md)}}, which are conceptually {{derived from biological [neurons](neuron.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-15,72,310!2024-08-30,59,310-->
