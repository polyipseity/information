# neural network

Advantages of neural network include {{highly parallel, making it suitable for parallel processing, and fault tolerance, in which small number of broken neurons degrade the model only slightly}}.

## models

### artificial neurons

ANNS are composed of {{[artificial neurons](artificial%20neuron.md)}}, which are conceptually {{derived from biological [neurons](neuron.md)}}.
