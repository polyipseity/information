# simple matching coefficient

{@{Two objects, _A_ and _B_, each with _n_ [binary](binary%20number.md) attributes}@} are given. Define:

- $M_{00}$ ::@:: number of attributes where _A_ has value 0 and _B_ has value 0
- $M_{01}$ ::@:: number of attributes where _A_ has value 0 and _B_ has value 1
- $M_{10}$ ::@:: number of attributes where _A_ has value 1 and _B_ has value 0
- $M_{11}$ ::@:: number of attributes where _A_ has value 1 and _B_ has value 1

The simple matching coefficient is defined as {@{$$\text{SMC} = \frac {\text{number of matching attributes} } {\text{number of attributes} } = \frac {M_{00} + M_{11} } {M_{00} + M_{01} + M_{10} + M_{11} }$$}@}.
