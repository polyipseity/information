# photon

A __photon__ is {{a [quantum](quantum.md) of the [electromagnetic field](electromagnetic%20field.md)}}.

## properties

A photon is {{[massless](massless%20particle.md)}}, so they {{always move at the [speed of light in vacuum](speed%20of%20light.md), 299&nbsp;792&nbsp;458&nbsp;m/s}}.

It carries {{[energy](energy.md) $E$ proportional to its [frequency](frequency.md) $f$}}:
{{$$E=hf$$}}
where {{$h$ is the [Planck constant](Planck%20constant.md)}}.
