# wavelength

In [physics](physics.md) and [mathematics](mathematics.md), __wavelength__ or __spatial period__ of {@{a [wave](wave.md) or [periodic function](periodic%20function.md) is the distance over which the [wave's shape](waveform.md) repeats}@}. In other words, it is the distance between {@{consecutive corresponding points of the same [_phase_](phase%20(waves).md) on the wave, such as two adjacent crests, troughs, or [zero crossings](zero%20crossing.md) in the same direction}@}. <!--SR:!2025-01-06,109,290!2025-01-30,130,290-->
