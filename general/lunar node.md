# lunar node

A __lunar node__ is {{either of the two [orbital nodes](orbital%20node.md) of the [Moon](Moon.md), that is, the two points at which the [orbit of the Moon](orbit%20of%20the%20Moon.md) [intersects](intersection%20(geometry).md) the [ecliptic](ecliptic.md)}}. This is caused by {{the Moon's orbital inclination (5°09′ or 5.145°) to the ecliptic}}. The {{_ascending_ (or _north_) node}} is {{where the Moon moves into the northern ecliptic hemisphere}}, while the {{_descending_ (or _south_)}} node is {{where the Moon enters the southern ecliptic hemisphere}}. The {{_line of nodes_}} is {{the line joining these two nodes}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-09,4,270!2024-07-08,3,250!2024-07-09,4,270!2024-07-09,4,270!2024-07-09,4,270!2024-07-09,4,270!2024-07-09,4,270!2024-07-09,4,270-->

## motion

The {{line of nodes}}, which is also {{the [intersects](intersection%20(geometry).md) between the two respective planes}}, {{rotates (precesses) with a period of 18.6 years or 19.5°/year or 19.1 days/year}}. When viewed from the celestial north, the nodes move {{clockwise around [Earth](Earth.md), i.e. with a [retrograde motion](retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion.md) (opposite to Earth's own spin and its revolution around the [Sun](Sun.md))}}. So the time {{from one node crossing to the next (see [eclipse season](eclipse%20season.md)) is approximately a half-year less half of 19.1 days, or about 173 days}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-08,3,250!2024-07-08,3,250!2024-07-08,3,250!2024-07-08,3,250!2024-07-08,3,250-->
