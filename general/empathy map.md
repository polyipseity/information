# empathy map

The empathy map can create {{a shared understanding of user pains and gains, and uncover latent ones}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-25,36,290-->

## structure

The empathy map consists of {{the user or persona at the center, and in Z order of the 4 quadrants: says, thinks, does, and feels}}. The user is in the center to {{remind who are we researching for}}. <!--SR:!2024-06-20,30,270!2024-07-08,47,290-->

- says ::: What the user says, ideally verbatim. Can overlap with thinks. <!--SR:!2024-07-23,58,310!2024-07-17,50,290-->
- thinks ::: What the user thinks. Can overlap with says. Take note of thoughts that the user is unwilling to vocalize, such as body language, choice of words, tone, etc. <!--SR:!2024-06-21,29,270!2024-06-26,33,270-->
- does ::: The user's actions and behaviors. This is simply what the user is doing. <!--SR:!2024-07-21,57,310!2024-07-29,63,310-->
- feels ::: The user's emotional state and its context, like the thing causing the emotional state. <!--SR:!2024-07-02,41,290!2024-06-04,20,270-->
