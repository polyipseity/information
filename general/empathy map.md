# empathy map

The empathy map can create {{a shared understanding of user pains and gains, and uncover latent ones}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-06,103,290-->

## structure

The empathy map consists of {{the user or persona at the center, and in Z order of the 4 quadrants: says, thinks, does, and feels}}. The user is in the center to {{remind who are we researching for}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-07,79,270!2025-01-12,188,310-->

- says ::: What the user says, ideally verbatim. Can overlap with thinks. <!--SR:!2024-07-23,58,310!2025-02-05,201,310-->
- thinks ::: What the user thinks. Can overlap with says. Take note of thoughts that the user is unwilling to vocalize, such as body language, choice of words, tone, etc. <!--SR:!2024-09-06,77,270!2024-09-22,88,270-->
- does ::: The user's actions and behaviors. This is simply what the user is doing. <!--SR:!2025-03-22,244,330!2024-07-29,63,310-->
- feels ::: The user's emotional state and its context, like the thing causing the emotional state. <!--SR:!2024-10-28,118,290!2024-08-17,74,290-->
