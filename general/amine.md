# amine

## physical properties

### boiling and melting points

Due to [hydrogen bonding](hydrogen%20bond.md), amines have {{[boiling points](boiling%20point.md) and [melting points](melting%20point.md) in between [alkanes](alkane.md) and [alcohols](alcohol.md)}}.

### density

Most amines are {{less [dense](density.md) than [water](water.md)}}. Density {{increases}} with increasing size.

### odor

[Gaseous](gas.md) amines have {{a [ammonia](ammonia.md) smell while [liquid](liquid.md) amines have a characteristic fishy smell}}.

### solubility

Amines {{that are small are [soluble](solubility.md) in [water](water.md)}}. Solubility {{decreases}} the larger the amine.
