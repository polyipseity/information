# Newton's method

__Newton's method__, also known as the __Newton–Raphson method__, is {{a [root-finding algorithm](root-finding%20algorithms.md)}}.

> {{Given an initial guess $x_0$ of the [roots](zero%20of%20a%20function.md) of a [real-valued function](real-valued%20function.md) $f$, if $f$ satisfies certain assumptions and $x_0$ is close to a [root](zero%20of%20a%20function.md), better [approximations](approximation.md) $x_{n+1}$ of one of the [root](zero%20of%20a%20function.md) are obtained by:$$x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$$}}
