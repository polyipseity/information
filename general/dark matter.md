# dark matter

In [astronomy](astronomy.md), __dark matter__ is {{a hypothetical form of [matter](matter.md) that appears not to interact with [light](light.md) or the [electromagnetic field](electromagnetic%20field.md)}}. Dark matter is implied by {{[gravitational](gravity.md) effects which cannot be explained by [general relativity](general%20relativity.md) unless more matter is present than can be seen}}. Such effects occur in the context of {{[formation and evolution of galaxies](galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution.md), [gravitational lensing](gravitational%20lens.md), the [observable universe](observable%20universe.md)'s current structure, mass position in [galactic collisions](interacting%20galaxy.md), the motion of galaxies within [galaxy clusters](galaxy%20cluster.md), and [cosmic microwave background](cosmic%20microwave%20background.md) anisotropies}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-27,52,310!2024-10-12,40,290!2024-12-08,61,230-->
