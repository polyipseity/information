# statistics

__Statistics__ (from {@{[German](german%20language.md): _Statistik_}@}, orig. {@{"description of a [state](state%20(polity).md), a country"}@}) is {@{the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of [data](data.md)}@}. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to {@{begin with a [statistical population](statistical%20population.md) or a [statistical model](statistical%20model.md) to be studied}@}. Populations can be {@{diverse groups of people or objects such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal"}@}. Statistics deals with {@{every aspect}@} of data, including {@{the planning of data collection in terms of the design of [surveys](survey%20methodology.md) and [experiments](design%20of%20experiments.md)}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-14,244,330!2025-07-11,241,330!2025-05-07,182,310!2024-11-29,68,310!2025-04-26,177,310!2024-11-26,65,310!2024-12-03,72,310-->

When {@{[census](census.md) data cannot be collected}@}, [statisticians](statistician.md) collect data by {@{developing specific experiment designs and survey [samples](sampling%20(statistics).md)}@}. {@{Representative sampling}@} assures that {@{inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole}@}. {@{An [experimental study](experiment.md)}@} involves {@{taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements}@}. In contrast, {@{an [observational study](observational%20study.md) does not involve experimental manipulation}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-16,244,330!2025-07-06,237,330!2024-11-28,67,310!2025-03-23,138,290!2025-06-15,220,330!2025-01-08,83,270!2025-07-30,256,330-->

{@{Two main statistical methods}@} are used in [data analysis](data%20analysis.md): {@{[descriptive statistics](descriptive%20statistics.md), which summarize data from a sample using [indexes](index%20(statistics).md) such as the [mean](mean.md) or [standard deviation](standard%20deviation.md)}@}, and {@{[inferential statistics](statistical%20inference.md), which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation)}@}. Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with {@{two sets of properties of a _distribution_ (sample or population): _[central tendency](central%20tendency.md)_ (or _location_) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while _[dispersion](statistical%20dispersion.md)_ (or _variability_) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other}@}. Inferences made using [mathematical statistics](mathematical%20statistics.md) employ {@{the framework of [probability theory](probability%20theory.md), which deals with the analysis of random phenomena}@}. <!--SR:!2025-02-09,117,290!2024-11-27,66,310!2025-02-09,117,290!2025-01-23,95,270!2025-06-10,216,330-->
