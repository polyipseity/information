# apparent weight

In [physics](physics.md), __apparent weight__ is {{a property of objects that corresponds to how heavy an object _appears_ to be}}. In many familiar situations, this is {{the [reaction force given by the ground](ground%20reaction%20force.md) opposing the [force of gravity](gravity.md) on the object}}. By contrast, ordinary [weight](weight.md) is {{the force of gravity acting on the object}}. When one is stationary, then {{the force of gravity are balanced by the ground reaction force, so apparent weight equals weight}}. However, they are different whenever {{the force of gravity is not balanced by the reaction force}}, such as {{in an accelerating lift, or [free falling](free%20fall.md)}}. This also means a "[weightless](weightlessness.md)" astronaut in [low Earth orbit](low%20Earth%20orbit.md) has {{an apparent weight of zero (the astronaut is free falling), but has almost the same weight as he would have while standing on the ground}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-14,160,310!2024-12-24,116,290!2025-05-31,244,330!2024-10-05,63,310!2025-04-16,209,330!2024-10-15,71,310!2025-01-18,124,290-->
