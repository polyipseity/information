# carbon monoxide

## occurrence

### astronomy

Beyond Earth, carbon monoxide is {{the second-most common diatomic molecule in the [interstellar medium](interstellar%20medium.md), after [molecular hydrogen](hydrogen.md)}}. Because of {{its asymmetry}}, this [polar molecule](chemical%20polarity.md#polar%20molecules) produces {{far brighter [spectral lines](spectral%20line.md) than the hydrogen molecule, making CO much easier to detect}}. Interstellar CO was first detected with {{[radio telescopes](radio%20telescope.md) in 1970}}. It is now {{the most commonly used tracer of molecular gas in general in the interstellar medium of galaxies}}, as {{molecular hydrogen can only be detected using ultraviolet light, which requires [space telescopes](space%20telescope.md)}}. Carbon monoxide observations provide {{much of the information about the [molecular clouds](molecular%20cloud.md) in which most [stars form](star%20formation.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-10-20,59,310!2024-11-03,69,310!2024-12-20,93,290!2024-10-23,41,210!2024-12-24,93,270!2024-10-20,48,250!2024-09-28,41,290-->
