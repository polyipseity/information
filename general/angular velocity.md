# angular velocity

## orbital angular velocity of a point particle

The angular velocity $\omega$ is {{the rate of change of angular position with respect to time, which can be computed from the cross-radial velocity}} as: {{$$\omega = \frac {\mathrm{d}\phi} {\mathrm{d}t} = \frac {v_{\perp} } r$$}}

Here, the cross-radial speed $v_{\perp}$ is {{the signed magnitude of $\mathbf{v}_{\perp}$, positive for counterclockwise motion, negative for clockwise}}, and the radius $r$ is {{the distance from the center}}.
