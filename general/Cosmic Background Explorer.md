# Cosmic Background Explorer

{{The __Cosmic Background Explorer__ (__COBE__ /ˈkoʊbi/ _KOH-bee_)}}, also referred to as {{__Explorer 66__}}, was {{a [NASA](NASA.md) satellite dedicated to [cosmology](physical%20cosmology.md), which operated from 1989 to 1993}}. Its goals were to {{investigate the [cosmic microwave background radiation](cosmic%20microwave%20background.md) (CMB or CMBR) of the [universe](universe.md)}} and {{provide measurements that would help shape our understanding of the [cosmos](cosmos.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-31,11,270!2024-09-08,17,290!2024-09-06,8,210!2024-09-15,19,250!2024-09-01,10,270-->

COBE's measurements provided {{two key pieces of evidence that supported the [Big Bang](Big%20Bang.md) theory of the universe}}: that {{the CMB has a near-perfect [black-body](black%20body.md) [spectrum](electromagnetic%20spectrum.md)}}, and that {{it has very faint [anisotropies](anisotropy.md)}}. Two of COBE's principal investigators, {{[George F. Smoot III](George%20Smoot.md) and [John C. Mather](John%20C.%20Mather.md)}}, received {{the [Nobel Prize in Physics](Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics.md) in 2006 for their work on the project}}. According to the Nobel Prize committee, {{"the COBE project can also be regarded as the starting point for [cosmology](cosmology.md) as a precision science"}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-06,15,290!2024-09-06,15,290!2024-09-07,16,290!2024-09-18,20,250!2024-09-20,24,270!2024-09-07,16,290-->

COBE was {{the second cosmic microwave background satellite, following [RELIKT-1](RELIKT-1.md)}}, and was followed by {{two more advanced spacecraft}}: {{the [Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe](Wilkinson%20Microwave%20Anisotropy%20Probe.md) (WMAP) operated from 2001 to 2010}} and {{the [Planck spacecraft](Planck%20(spacecraft).md) from 2009 to 2013}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-30,10,250!2024-09-29,31,270!2024-09-01,8,230!2024-09-05,9,250-->
