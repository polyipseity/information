# nitric acid

__Nitric acid__ is {@{a [mineral acid](mineral%20acid.md) with the [chemical formula](chemical%20formula.md) __HNO<sub>3</sub>__}@}.

## chemistry

### reactions with metals

Very dilute nitric acid {@{oxidizes reactive [metals](metal.md) to form metal [nitrates](nitrate.md) and [hydrogen](hydrogen.md)}@}.

Dilute nitric acid {@{oxidizes less reactive metals to form colorless [nitric oxide](nitric%20oxide.md), which may further react with [atmospheric](atmosphere%20of%20Earth.md) [oxygen](oxygen.md) to form brown [nitrogen dioxide](nitrogen%20dioxide.md)}@}. Concentrated nitric acid {@{reacts similarly but directly produces nitrogen dioxide}@}.

### reactions with nonmetals

Concentrated nitric acid {@{oxidizes [sulfites](sulfite.md) to [sulfates](sulfate.md)}@}. Hot ones also {@{oxidizes [carbon](carbon.md) to [carbon dioxide](carbon%20dioxide.md) and [sulfur](sulfur.md) to [sulfur dioxide](sulfur%20dioxide.md)}@}. All of above produces nitrogen dioxide as well.
