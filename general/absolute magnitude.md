# absolute magnitude

In [astronomy](astronomy.md), __absolute magnitude__ ({{___M___}}) is {{a measure of the [luminosity](luminosity.md) of a [celestial object](astronomical%20object.md) on an inverse [logarithmic](logarithmic%20scale.md) [astronomical magnitude](magnitude%20(astronomy).md) scale}}. An object's absolute magnitude is defined to be {{equal to the [apparent magnitude](apparent%20magnitude.md) that the object would have if it were viewed from a distance of exactly 10 [parsecs](parsec.md) (32.6 [light-years](light-year.md)), without [extinction](extinction%20(astronomy).md) (or dimming) of its light due to absorption by [interstellar matter](interstellar%20medium.md) and [cosmic dust](cosmic%20dust.md)}}.
