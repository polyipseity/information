# supercluster

A __supercluster__ is {{a large group of smaller [galaxy clusters](galaxy%20cluster.md) or [galaxy groups](galaxy%20group.md)}}; they are among {{the largest known structures in the [universe](universe.md)}}. A supercluster is not necessarily {{[gravitationally](gravity.md) bound, which is unlike smaller astronomical structures}}.

The [Milky Way](Milky%20Way.md) is part of {{the [Local Group](Local%20Group.md)}}, which is part of {{the [Virgo Supercluster](Virgo%20Supercluster.md)}}, which is part of {{the [Laniakea Supercluster](Laniakea%20Supercluster.md)}}, which is part of {{the [Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex](Pisces–Cetus%20Supercluster%20Complex.md)}}.
