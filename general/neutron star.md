# neutron star

A __neutron star__ is {{the [collapsed](gravitational%20collapse.md) [core](stellar%20structure.md) of a massive [supergiant star](supergiant.md)}}. It results from {{the [supernova](supernova.md) explosion of a [massive star](stellar%20evolution.md#massive%20star)—combined with [gravitational collapse](gravitational%20collapse.md)—that compresses the core past [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md) star density to that of [atomic nuclei](atomic%20nucleus.md)}}. Except for {{[black holes](black%20hole.md)}}, neutron stars are {{the smallest and densest known class of stellar objects}}. They have a radius {{on the order of 10 kilometers (6 mi) and a mass of about 1.4 M<sub>☉</sub>}}. Stars that collapse into neutron stars have {{a total [mass](mass.md) of between 10 and 25 [solar masses](solar%20mass.md) (M<sub>☉</sub>)}}, or {{possibly more for those that are especially rich in [elements heavier than hydrogen and helium](metallicity.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-17,11,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270-->

## rotation

### spin up

Neutron star rotational speeds can {{increase, a process known as spin up}}. Sometimes neutron stars {{absorb orbiting matter from companion stars}}, increasing {{the rotation rate and reshaping the neutron star into an [oblate spheroid](spheroid.md#oblate%20spheroids)}}. This causes {{an increase in the rate of rotation of the neutron star of over a hundred times per second in the case of millisecond pulsars}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270!2024-08-07,4,270-->
