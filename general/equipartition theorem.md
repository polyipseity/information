# equipartition theorem

The equipartition theorem is inaccurate when {{[quantum effects](quantum%20mechanics.md) are significant, like at low [temperatures](temperature.md)}}. This is caused by {{some [degrees of freedom](degrees%20of%20freedom%20(physics%20and%20chemistry).md) "freezing out" because the [thermal energy](thermal%20energy.md) $k_\text{B}T$ is less than the quantum energy spacing of that particular degree of freedom}}.
