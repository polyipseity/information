# conditional probability

## definition

### conditioning on an event

#### Kolmogorov definition

The conditional probability can be found by {{the [quotient](quotient.md) of the probability of the joint intersection of events $A$ and $B$, that is, $P(A \cap B)$, the probability that both events happen together, divided by the [probability](probability.md) of $B$}}: {{$$P(A \mid B) = \frac {P(A \cap B)} {P(B)} \qquad P(B) > 0$$}}.
