# Lenz's law

__Lenz's law__ states that {{the direction of the [electric current](electric%20current.md) in a [conductor](electrical%20conductor.md) [induced](electromagnetic%20induction.md) by a changing [magnetic field](magnetic%20field.md) is such that the magnetic field created by the induced current opposes changes in the original magnetic field}}.
