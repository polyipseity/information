# cosmic time

## reference point

There are {{two main ways}} for establishing a reference point for cosmic time. <!--SR:!2025-03-14,181,310-->

### lookback time

{{The present tim can be used as the cosmic reference point}} creating __lookback time__. This can be described {{in terms of the time light has taken to arrive here from a distance object}}. Alternatively, this may be formulated as {{the difference between the current age of the universe (13.8 billion years) and the age of the universe when the light left the distance object}}. <!--SR:!2025-05-25,252,330!2025-02-05,166,310!2024-09-19,63,310-->

Note that this may not {{be the current distance of the object from here (converted to lightyears) as the object may have moved in the meantime}}. For an object of which {{light has yet to reach here}}, lookback time is {{undefined because we here are not even aware of the existence of such an object}}. <!--SR:!2024-09-27,68,310!2024-11-04,82,270!2025-01-31,160,310-->
