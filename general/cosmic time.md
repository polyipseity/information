# cosmic time

## reference point

There are {{two main ways}} for establishing a reference point for cosmic time. <!--SR:!2024-07-17,15,290-->

### lookback time

{{The present tim can be used as the cosmic reference point}} creating __lookback time__. This can be described {{in terms of the time light has taken to arrive here from a distance object}}. Alternatively, this may be formulated as {{the difference between the current age of the universe (13.8 billion years) and the age of the universe when the light left the distance object}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-17,15,290!2024-08-23,40,290!2024-07-18,16,290-->

Note that this may not {{be the current distance of the object from here (converted to lightyears) as the object may have moved in the meantime}}. For an object of which {{light has yet to reach here}}, lookback time is {{undefined because we here are not even aware of the existence of such an object}}. <!--SR:!2024-07-19,17,290!2024-07-14,12,270!2024-07-15,13,290-->
