# momentum

In [Newtonian mechanics](Newtonian%20mechanics.md), __momentum__ (pl.: {{__momenta__ or __momentums__}}; more specifically {{__linear momentum__ or __translational momentum__}}) is {{the [product](multiplication.md) of the [mass](mass.md) and [velocity](velocity.md) of an [object](physical%20object.md)}}. It is {{a [vector](vector%20(mathematics%20and%20physics).md) quantity, possessing a [magnitude](magnitude%20(mathematics).md) and a direction}}. Given {{$m$ is the mass of an object, and $\mathbf v$ is its velocity (also a vector quantity)}}, then the object's momentum {{$\mathbf p$ (from [Latin](Latin.md) _pellere_ "push, drive")}} is: {{$$\mathbf p = m \mathbf v$$}}. <!--SR:!2025-05-16,233,330!2024-10-13,69,310!2024-09-30,58,310!2025-01-05,118,310!2025-05-24,238,330!2024-10-04,61,310!2024-10-14,70,310-->

## definition in classical mechanics

### conservation

In {{a [closed system](closed%20system.md) (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces)}} the total momentum {{remains constant}}. This fact, known as {{the __law of conservation of momentum__}}, is implied by {{[Newton's laws of motion](Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion.md)}}. <!--SR:!2024-12-14,108,290!2025-05-15,231,330!2025-01-25,131,290!2025-05-13,231,330-->
