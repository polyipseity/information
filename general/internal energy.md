# internal energy

The __internal energy__ is {{the [energy](energy.md) contained in a [thermodynamic system](thermodynamic%20system.md)}}.

## internal energy of ideal gas

The internal energy of an [ideal gas](ideal%20gas.md) depends {{only on its [temperature](temperature.md) and its [amount of substance](amount%20of%20substance.md) (i.e. number of [moles](mole%20(unit).md)), and can be written as $U = U(n, T)$. It does not depend on other quantities like [pressure](pressure.md), [volume](volume.md), and [density](density.md)}}. In contrast, {{the internal energy of a [real gas](real%20gas.md) depends on other quantities, but its [temperature](temperature.md) still only depends on its internal [kinetic energy](kinetic%20energy.md)}}.
