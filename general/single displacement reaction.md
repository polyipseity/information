# single displacement reaction

A __single displacement reaction__, also called {{__single replacement reaction__ or __exchange reaction__}}, is {{a [chemical reaction](chemical%20reaction.md) in which one [element](chemical%20element.md) is displaced by another in a [compound](chemical%20compound.md)}}: <!--SR:!2024-05-28,280,290!2024-02-05,189,250-->

> {{A + BC â†’ AC + B}}
>
> where either
> - $\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$ are [cations](ion.md) and $\text{C}$ is an [anion](ion.md); or
> - $\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$ are [halogens](halogen.md) and $\text{C}$ is a [cation](ion.md).

This often happens when {{$\text{A}$ is more [reactive](reactivity%20(chemistry).md) than $\text{B}$}}. <!--SR:!2024-05-24,322,330-->
