# single displacement reaction

A __single displacement reaction__, also called {@{__single replacement reaction__ or __exchange reaction__}@}, is {@{a [chemical reaction](chemical%20reaction.md) in which one [element](chemical%20element.md) is displaced by another in a [compound](chemical%20compound.md)}@}:

> - {@{$\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$ are [cations](ion.md) and $\text{C}$ is an [anion](ion.md)}@}; or
> - {@{$\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$ are [halogens](halogen.md) and $\text{C}$ is a [cation](ion.md)}@}.

This often happens when {@{$\text{A}$ is more [reactive](reactivity%20(chemistry).md) than $\text{B}$}@}.
