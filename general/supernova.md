# supernova

A __supernova__ (pl.: __supernovae__ or __supernovas__) is {{a powerful and luminous [explosion](explosion.md) of a [star](star.md)}}. A supernova occurs {{during the last [evolutionary stages](stellar%20evolution.md) of a [massive star](star.md#massive%20stars), or when a [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md) is triggered into runaway [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md)}}. The original object, called {{the _progenitor_}}, either {{collapses to a [neutron star](neutron%20star.md) or [black hole](black%20hole.md), or is completely destroyed to form a [diffuse nebula](nebula.md#diffuse%20nebulae)}}. The peak optical [luminosity](luminosity.md) of a supernova can be {{comparable to that of an entire [galaxy](galaxy.md) before fading over several weeks or months}}. <!--SR:!2025-09-09,314,330!2025-01-07,106,290!2025-07-03,260,330!2025-03-04,160,310!2024-12-27,108,290-->

## classification

Astronomers classify supernovae {{according to their [light curves](light%20curve.md) and the [absorption lines](spectral%20line.md) of different [chemical elements](chemical%20element.md) that appear in their [spectra](astronomical%20spectroscopy.md)}}. If {{a supernova's spectrum contains lines of [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) (known as the [Balmer series](Balmer%20series.md) in the visual portion of the spectrum)}} it is {{classified _Type II_; otherwise it is _Type I_}}. In each of these two types there are {{subdivisions according to the presence of lines from other elements or the shape of the light curve (a graph of the supernova's apparent magnitude as a function of time)}}. <!--SR:!2024-11-12,64,263!2024-11-09,75,323!2024-12-31,101,283!2025-03-31,186,323-->
