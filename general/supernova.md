# supernova

A __supernova__ (pl.: __supernovae__ or __supernovas__) is {{a powerful and luminous [explosion](explosion.md) of a [star](star.md)}}. A supernova occurs {{during the last [evolutionary stages](stellar%20evolution.md) of a [massive star](star.md#massive%20stars), or when a [white dwarf](white%20dwarf.md) is triggered into runaway [nuclear fusion](nuclear%20fusion.md)}}. The original object, called {{the _progenitor_}}, either {{collapses to a [neutron star](neutron%20star.md) or [black hole](black%20hole.md), or is completely destroyed to form a [diffuse nebula](nebula.md#diffuse%20nebulae)}}. The peak optical [luminosity](luminosity.md) of a supernova can be {{comparable to that of an entire [galaxy](galaxy.md) before fading over several weeks or months}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-02,3,250-->
