# Herbig–Haro object

__Herbig–Haro__(__HH__) __objects__ are {{bright patches of [nebulosity](nebula.md) associated with newborn [stars](star.md)}}. They are formed when {{narrow jets of partially [ionised gas](plasma%20(physics).md) ejected by stars collide with nearby clouds of gas and dust at several hundred kilometers per second}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-03,4,270-->

## formation

- see: [astrophysical jet](astrophysical%20jet.md), [star formation](star%20formation.md)

Stars form by {{gravitational collapse of [interstellar gas clouds](interstellar%20cloud.md)}}. As the collapse {{increases the density, [radiative energy](radiation.md) loss decreases due to increased [opacity](opacity.md)}}. This {{raises the temperature of the cloud which prevents further collapse, and a hydrostatic equilibrium is established}}. Gas continues to {{fall towards the core in a [rotating disk](accretion%20disk.md)}}. The core of this system is called {{a [protostar](protostar.md)}}. Some of the [accreting](accretion%20(astrophysics).md) material is {{ejected out along the star's [axis of rotation](rotation.md) in two [jets](astrophysical%20jet.md) of partially ionised gas ([plasma](plasma%20(physics).md))}}. The mechanism for producing these collimated bipolar jets is {{not entirely understood}}, but it is believed that {{interaction between the accretion disk and the [stellar magnetic field](stellar%20magnetic%20field.md) accelerates some of the accreting material from within a few [astronomical units](astronomical%20unit.md) of the star away from the disk plane}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-07-31,1,230!2024-08-02,3,250!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-02,3,250!2024-08-03,4,270!2024-08-03,4,270-->
