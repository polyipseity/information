# Herbig–Haro object

__Herbig–Haro__(__HH__) __objects__ are {@{bright patches of [nebulosity](nebula.md) associated with newborn [stars](star.md)}@}. They are formed when {@{narrow jets of partially [ionised gas](plasma%20(physics).md) ejected by stars collide with nearby clouds of gas and dust at several hundred kilometers per second}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-03,260,330!2025-03-16,167,310-->

## formation

- see: [astrophysical jet](astrophysical%20jet.md), [star formation](star%20formation.md)

Stars form by {@{gravitational collapse of [interstellar gas clouds](interstellar%20cloud.md)}@}. As the collapse {@{increases the density, [radiative energy](radiation.md) loss decreases due to increased [opacity](opacity.md)}@}. This {@{raises the temperature of the cloud which prevents further collapse, and a hydrostatic equilibrium is established}@}. Gas continues to {@{fall towards the core in a [rotating disk](accretion%20disk.md)}@}. The core of this system is called {@{a [protostar](protostar.md)}@}. Some of the [accreting](accretion%20(astrophysics).md) material is {@{ejected out along the star's [axis of rotation](rotation.md) in two [jets](astrophysical%20jet.md) of partially ionised gas ([plasma](plasma%20(physics).md))}@}. The mechanism for producing these collimated bipolar jets is {@{not entirely understood}@}, but it is believed that {@{interaction between the accretion disk and the [stellar magnetic field](stellar%20magnetic%20field.md) accelerates some of the accreting material from within a few [astronomical units](astronomical%20unit.md) of the star away from the disk plane}@}. <!--SR:!2025-07-02,257,330!2025-04-18,155,230!2024-12-02,82,270!2025-04-13,179,310!2025-06-28,255,330!2025-01-19,123,290!2025-04-30,193,310!2024-12-09,85,270-->
