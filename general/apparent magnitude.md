# apparent magnitude

__Apparent magnitude__ ({{___m___}}) is {{a measure of the [brightness](irradiance.md) of a [star](star.md) or other [astronomical object](astronomical%20object.md)}}. An object's apparent magnitude depends on {{its intrinsic [luminosity](luminosity.md), its distance, and any [extinction](extinction%20(astronomy).md) of the object's light caused by [interstellar dust](cosmic%20dust.md) along the [line of sight](line%20of%20sight.md) to the observer}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-12,16,290!2024-08-09,13,297!2024-08-10,14,297-->

The word _magnitude_ in [astronomy](astronomy.md), unless stated otherwise, usually refers to {{a celestial object's apparent magnitude}}. The magnitude scale dates to {{before the ancient Roman astronomer [Claudius Ptolemy](Ptolemy.md),}} whose star catalog popularized the system by {{listing [stars](star.md) from [1st magnitude](first-magnitude%20star.md) (brightest) to 6th magnitude (dimmest)}}. The modern scale was {{mathematically defined in a way to closely match this historical system}}. <!--SR:!2024-08-12,16,297!2024-08-13,17,290!2024-08-09,13,297!2024-08-11,15,297-->

The scale is {{reverse [logarithmic](logarithmic%20scale.md)}}: {{the brighter an object is, the lower its [magnitude](magnitude%20(astronomy).md) number}}. A difference of 1.0 in magnitude corresponds to {{a brightness ratio of $\sqrt[5]{100}$, or about 2.512}}. For example, a star of magnitude 2.0 is {{2.512 times as bright}} as a star of magnitude 3.0, {{6.31 times as bright}} as a star of magnitude 4.0, and {{100 times as bright}} as one of magnitude 7.0. <!--SR:!2024-08-11,15,297!2024-08-11,15,290!2024-09-16,39,290!2024-08-10,14,290!2024-09-04,27,277!2024-08-13,17,297-->
