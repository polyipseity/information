# nanomaterials

__Nanomaterials__ describe {{[materials](material.md) of which a single unit is sized with at least one [dimension](dimension.md) in the range 1 to 100 [nm](nanometer.md)}}.

Nanomaterials often have {{unique [optical properties](optical%20properties.md), mechanical properties, electrical properties due to [surface area effect](surface-area-to-volume%20ratio.md) and [quantum effect](quantum%20mechanics.md)}}.
