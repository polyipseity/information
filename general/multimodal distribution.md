# multimodal distribution

In [statistics](statistics.md), a __multimodal__ __distribution__ is {@{a [probability distribution](probability%20distribution.md) with more than one (local) [mode](mode%20(statistics).md) (i.e., more than one local peak of the distribution)}@}. These appear as {@{distinct peaks (local maxima) in the [probability density function](probability%20density%20function.md)}@}. {@{Categorical, continuous, and discrete data}@} can all form multimodal distributions. Among {@{univariate analyses}@}, multimodal distributions are {@{commonly bimodal}@}.
