# multimodal distribution

In [statistics](statistics.md), a __multimodal__ __distribution__ is {{a [probability distribution](probability%20distribution.md) with more than one (local) [mode](mode%20(statistics).md) (i.e., more than one local peak of the distribution)}}. These appear as {{distinct peaks (local maxima) in the [probability density function](probability%20density%20function.md)}}. {{Categorical, continuous, and discrete data}} can all form multimodal distributions. Among {{univariate analyses}}, multimodal distributions are {{commonly bimodal}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-16,122,290!2025-01-17,94,290!2024-11-21,60,310!2025-02-16,122,290!2024-11-17,59,310-->
