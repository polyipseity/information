# titration

__Titration__ is {{[quantitative](quantitative%20research.md) [chemical method](analytical%20chemistry.md) to determine the [concentration](concentration.md) of an [analyte](analyte.md)}}.

## types

### acid–base titration

- see: [acid–base titration](acid–base%20titration.md)

Acid–base titrations {{depend on [neutralization](neutralization%20(chemistry).md) between an [acid](acid.md) and a [base](base%20(chemistry).md)}}. It is measured {{using a [pH indicator](pH%20indicator.md)}}. The equivalence point is {{when complete neutralization occurs}}. The end point is {{when the [pH indicator](pH%20indicator.md) changes color sharply}}. For this reason, {{the pH indicator is chosen such that the equivalence point falls in its range of color change}}. For more accuracy, {{a [pH meter](pH%20meter.md) can be used}}.

If a [strong acid](acid%20strength.md) and a [strong base](base%20strength.md) are used, {{the [titration curve](#titration%20curve) is regular and many pH indicators are appropriate}}. If one is strong while the other is weak, {{the equivalence point shifts to the stronger side}}. If both are weak, {{the titration curve is very irregular and a [pH meter](pH%20meter.md) is often used instead of a [pH indicator](pH%20indicator.md)}}.

## measurement

%%

```Python
# 08e5b0a3-f78a-46af-bf50-eb9b12f7fa1e generate data
return await memorize_table(
  __env__.cwf_sects('d981', '248f'),
  ('name', 'description',),
  (
    ('indicator', 'Using a [substance](chemical%20substance.md) that changes color to a [chemical change](chemical%20change.md) to monitor the reaction. [pH indicators](pH%20indicator.md) are used in [acid–base titration](#acid–base%20titration).',),
    ('[pH meter](pH%20meter.md)', 'The [pH](pH.md) is measured throughout the reaction. A sudden pH change happens at the end point.',),
    ('[thermometric titration](thermometric%20titration.md)', 'The [temperature](temperature.md) change is measured and then plotted to find the end point.',),
  ),
)

### equivalence and end point

The _equivalence point_ is {{the theoretical completion of titration}}. The _end point_ is {{the actual measured change}}.

### back titration

In back titration, {{a known excess reagent is added to the [solution](solution%20(chemistry).md), and the excess is titrated instead of the original solution}}.
