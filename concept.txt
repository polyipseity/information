Conceptualization
We should get into the details.


Transfer
Firstly, relocation requires multiple locations.  Transfering items from oneself to oneself is not reloaction.
In the process of relocation, the total amount of stuff should be kept the same.
One simple way to achieve is to decrement the amount from the giver and increase the amount of the receiver.

However, this is assuming that the giver and the receiver contains stuff at all,
and that they can be decremented and incremeneted at will.
Apart from that, the API is not suppose to care about the givers and the receivers at all except for the transfer.
We can assume that the giver and the receiver will do the right things themselves when stuff are transfered by the API,
since that is not our responability.

Now, another problem, who gets to dictate the transfer?  The API itself is not supposed to activate itself for no reason, right?
To the API, there is not really a way to tell who dictates the transfer (hence controller),
and it should not really matter anyway as the controller does not participate in the transfer but activate the transfer.
So that means, we will also assume that whoever using the API is also using it correctly.

Therefore, the assumption is that the givers and the receivers will respond appropriately to the transfer API
activated by an unknown trigger correctly.
This also means that the givers and the receivers should not know about the trigger.
The trigger, however, is allowed to know information of the givers and the receivers
through the information of the transfer API.
