Design


Transfer
The API should act as a bridge between the controller and the senders and receivers (hence 'participants').
Since the participants may be any arbitrary object, the controller cannot do anything.
An interface can be used to bridge them.
Only participants can be interfaced as they are the only things known to the API.
Since the participants can be arbitrarily chosen by the controller, participants should not know each other.
That means each participants should have an interface that only does transfer.


Stuff
Stuff should only have 3 properties listed before.  As an instance of type may be anything,
we will also need an interface for stuff.
