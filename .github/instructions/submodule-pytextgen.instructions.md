- This is a git submodule for the pytextgen content generation library (external dependency)
- **Default behavior**: Avoid editing unless user explicitly requests it
- **If editing is needed but not requested**: Ask the user for permission first
- **When user approves edits**: Make changes here, test thoroughly, then contribute upstream
- For upstream contributions: work in the pytextgen repo, merge changes, then update submodule pointer
