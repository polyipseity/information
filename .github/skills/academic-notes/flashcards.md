# Flashcard conventions (academic notes)

- Every Markdown section in a topic note must have at least one flashcard entry. Index files (`index.md`) are exempt and only need session-level cards. A section may use cloze glosses (`::@::`) or a two-sided QA list with the exact phrase **Flashcards for this section are as follows:** preceded by `---`. The validator warns if prose appears under a header without any cards. When editing or expanding a section, update its glosses so they mirror the text.
- Add a gloss by appending `::@::` after a linked term. The text after `::@::` becomes the card content. Example: `- programming paradigm ::@:: It is a relatively high-level way to conceptualize and structure the implementation of a computer program.`
- Two-sided QA lists require a horizontal rule and the sentence above the list. Leave a blank line after `---` for readability. List items themselves still use the `::@::` or `:@:` syntax.
- Flashcard activation tags use the pattern `flashcard/active/special/academia/<INSTITUTION>/<PAGE>` where `<INSTITUTION>` is the canonical short name (e.g. `HKUST`, `MIT`) and `<PAGE>` is the page ID with underscores for spaces (e.g. `COMP_3031`). Preserve existing tags; if one is missing propose a small PR rather than bulk changes.
- Keep glosses concise. Use cloze hints or one-line definitions only for brief terms. Long derivations, proofs, or paragraphs should not be auto-flashcarded. The text after `::@::` should normally be one or two sentences; longer content makes weak cards.
- When you need a parent bullet to group related cards, give the parent a full path label such as `ELEC 1100 / class expectations`. Nesting may be multiple levels deep. If a folder has only a single gloss and the parent has no gloss, collapse the structure by placing the entire path on the gloss line instead of adding an extra indirection.
- Calculation cards must be self-contained. Put the full problem statement with values, circuit parameters, or given quantities on the left side of `::@::` and the answer or solution steps on the right. Include formulas and substitution steps so reviewers can replay the computation mentally. Common examples use $E=qV$, $P=IV$, or $P=I^{2}R$.
- Always include units inside math delimiters (e.g. `$5\text{ V}$`, `$2.6\text{ mW}$`). Units outside `$…$` are treated as plain text and may render poorly or confuse the parser.
- Every gloss must start with the complete hierarchical path (for example `ELEC 1100 / teaching methodology / traditional limitations`). Do not rely on indentation or headers for context; only the literal text is used by the flashcard generator.
- Do not invent artificial parent folders such as “Week 1 lecture 1”. The surrounding section header already provides the necessary context and should not be repeated in the gloss path.
