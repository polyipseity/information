Detailed continuous-improvement guidance for this skill is embedded under
the "Continuous improvement" heading within the main `SKILL.md` file.
Please consult that section whenever you're editing flashcards, as it
contains the comprehensive feedback loop, collection steps, and numerous
examples of lessons learned.
