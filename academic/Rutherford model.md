# Rutherford model

The __{{Rutherford}} model__ is {{a historical scientific model of the [atom](atom.md)}}. The model has {{[electrons](electron.md) orbiting around a tiny and heavy central positive charge called the "[nucleus](nucleus.md)"}}. It was first proposed by {{[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md)}} in {{1911}}.

## problems

Orbiting electrons {{undergo acceleration}}, so {{[electromagnetic waves](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) should be emitted}}. The electrons {{lose energy}}, {{spiralling inwards and collapsing into the nucleus}}. This is problematic as {{the model implies all atoms are unstable}}. Also, as the electrons spiral inwards, {{the frequency of emission increases}} as {{the orbital period becomes shorter}}, so {{a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiation should be emitted}}. However, it is observed that {{radiation are emitted at discrete frequencies}}.
