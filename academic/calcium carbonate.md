# calcium carbonate

__Calcium carbonate__, also known as {{limestone}}, is a solid [ionic compound](ionic%20compound.md). Its molecular formula is {{CaCO<sub>3</sub>}}. It looks like a {{white solid}}. <!--SR:!2025-02-08,678,319!2024-10-10,642,317!2023-06-04,286,278-->

It is commonly found in {{the [rocks](rock%20(geology).md) [limestone](limestone.md), [chalk](chalk.md), and [marble](marble.md)}} as {{the [minerals](mineral.md) [calcite](calcite.md), [aragonite](aragonite.md), and [dolomite](dolomite%20(mineral).md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-05-12,35,280!2023-04-08,1,230-->

## reactions

Calcium carbonate {{[decomposes](thermal%20decomposition.md) under heating}}.

It also {{reacts with [acids](acid.md)}}.
> {{CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2HCl(aq) â†’ CaCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)}} <!--SR:!2024-11-09,583,257!2023-10-21,366,279-->

### tests

To test for calcium carbonate, both {{calcium ions and carbonate ions}} are tested for. The former can be detected by the {{[flame test](flame%20test.md)}}, in which a {{brick red flame}} can be observed. The latter can be tested by adding {{[dilute hydrochloric acid](dilute%20hydrochloric%20acid)}}, in which {{colorless gas}} that {{turns [limewater](calcium%20hydroxide.md) milky}} is given out. <!--SR:!2023-04-16,237,258!2023-04-12,233,258!2023-04-13,234,259!2023-07-06,103,230!2023-04-18,61,210!2023-05-21,272,279-->
