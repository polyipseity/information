# single displacement reaction

A __single displacement reaction__, also called {{__single replacement reaction__ or __exchange reaction__}}, is {{a [chemical reaction](chemical%20reaction.md) in which one [element](chemical%20element.md) is displaced by another in a [compound](chemical%20compound.md)}}:

> {{$\text{A}+\text{BC}\rightarrow\text{AC}+\text{B}$
>
> where either
> - $\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$ are [cations](ion.md) and $\text{C}$ is an [anion](ion.md); or
> - $\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$ are [halogens](halogen.md) and $\text{C}$ is a [cation](ion.md).}}

This often happens when {{$\text{A}$ is more [reactive](reactivity%20(chemistry).md) than $\text{B}$}}.
