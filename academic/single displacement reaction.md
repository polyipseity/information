# single displacement reaction

A __single displacement reaction__, also called {{__single replacement reaction__ or __exchange reaction__}}, is {{a [chemical reaction](chemical%20reaction.md) in which one [element](chemical%20element.md) is displaced by another in a [compound](chemical%20compound.md)}}: <!--SR:!2023-06-10,18,250!2023-07-29,74,250-->

> {{A + BC â†’ AC + B
>
> where either
> - A and B are [cations](ion.md) and C is an [anion](ion.md); or
> - A and B are [halogens](halogen.md) and C is a [cation](ion.md).}}

This often happens when {{$\text{A}$ is more [reactive](reactivity%20(chemistry).md) than $\text{B}$}}. <!--SR:!2023-07-05,72,310-->
