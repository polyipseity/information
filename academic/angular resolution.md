## Rayleigh's criterion

The {{Rayleigh}}'s criterion is that {{two point sources are considered just resolved when the principal diffraction maximum of the [Airy disk](Airy%20disk.md) of an image coincide with the first minimum of the [Airy disk](Airy%20disk.md) of the other}}. <!--SR:!2023-05-12,4,270!2023-05-21,10,250-->

According to the criterion, diffraction through a circular [aperture](aperture.md) gives:

> diffraction {{through a circular [aperture](aperture.md)}}
> - {{$\theta\approx1.22\frac\lambda{D}\quad\mathrm{(considering\ that\ \sin\theta\approx\theta)}$}}
>
> where {{_θ_ is _angular resolution_ in [radians](radian.md), _λ_ is the [wavelength](wavelength.md), and _D_ is the [diameter](diameter.md) of the [aperture](aperture.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-05-12,4,270!2023-05-12,4,270!2023-05-24,13,270-->
