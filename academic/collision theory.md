# collision theory

__Collision theory__ is {{a [chemistry](chemistry.md) principle to predict [reaction rates](reaction%20rate.md)}}. It states that {{when [reactant](reagent.md) particles collide at the right orientation with sufficient energy, known as [activation energy](activation%20energy.md), _effective collision_ occurs, resulting in products}}. <!--SR:!2023-06-05,30,270!2023-08-11,85,272-->
