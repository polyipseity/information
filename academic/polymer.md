# polymer

A __polymer__ is {{a [substance](chemical%20substance.md) consisting of [macromolecules](macromolecule.md) with [repeating subunits](repeat%20unit.md)}}. It is created by {{the [polymerization](polymerization.md) of [monomers](monomer.md)}}. Examples include {{[plastics](plastic.md), [DNAs](DNA.md), and [proteins](protein.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-04-06,3,250!2023-04-06,3,250!2023-04-06,3,250-->

## synthesis

- See: [polymerization](polymerization.md)

Synthetic methods are categorized into {{[step-growth polymerization](step-growth%20polymerization.md), in which multiple chains of monomers can growth concurrently and combine, and [chain-growth polymerization](chain-growth%20polymerization.md), in which monomers are added to chains one by one}}. The former includes {{[polycondensation](polycondenstaion.md), in which small [molecular](molecule.md) [by-products](by-product.md) are produced in [condensation reactions](condensation%20reaction.md) to create [condensation polymers](condensation%20polymer.md), and [polyaddition](polyaddition.md), in which no by-products are formed in [addition reactions](addition%20reaction.md) to create [addition polymers](addition%20polymer.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-04-07,3,250!2023-04-07,3,250-->
