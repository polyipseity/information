# Le Chatelier's principle

__Le Chatelier's principle__ is {{a principle of [chemistry](chemistry.md) used to predict the effect of changes on [chemical equilibra](chemical%20equilibrium.md)}} that states that {{when a [thermodynamic equilibrium](thermodynamic%20equilibrium.md) is disturbed by a change, the equilibrium position will change to counteract the change partly}}.
