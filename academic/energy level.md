# energy level

A {{[bound](bound%20state.md) [quantum mechanical](quantum%20mechanics.md) system or [particle](particle.md)}} can only have {{certain discrete values of energy}}, called __energy levels__. <!--SR:!2023-07-31,139,250!2024-02-04,266,270-->

The lowest possible energy level is called the {{_[ground state](ground%20state.md)_}}, while all other higher energy levels are called {{_[excited states](excited%20state.md)_}}. <!--SR:!2024-03-09,349,330!2024-02-24,337,330-->
