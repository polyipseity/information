# London dispersion force

__London dispersion forces__ (__LDF__) are {{[intermolecular forces](intermolecular%20force.md) between non-[polar](chemical%20polarity.md) [atoms](atom.md) and [molecules](molecule.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-07-20,79,290-->

They are stronger if {{the [polarizability](polarizability.md) of the molecules are higher, which is increased by larger molecular sizes and having molecular shapes with greater surface areas}}. <!--SR:!2023-07-06,25,230-->
