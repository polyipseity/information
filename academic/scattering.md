# scattering

__Scattering__ describes {{a wide range of physical processes where moving [particle](particle.md) or [radiation](radiation.md) deviates from a straight [trajectory](trajectory.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-07-04,124,250-->

## experiments

Scattering experiments are important in {{discovering new particles}} and {{studying structure of particles}}. Examples include {{the [Geiger–Marsden experiments](Geiger–Marsden%20experiments.md)}}. {{[Laws of physics](laws%20of%20physics.md)}} are employed in analysis. <!--SR:!2023-05-05,97,270!2024-04-27,363,290!2023-11-29,245,270!2023-09-08,175,292-->
