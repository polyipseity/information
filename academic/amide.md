# amide

## physical properties

### boiling and melting points

Due to [hydrogen bonding](hydrogen%20bond.md), amides have {{higher [boiling points](boiling%20point.md) and [melting points](melting%20point.md) than comparable [carboxylic acids](carboxylic%20acid.md)}}.

### density

Amides are {{slightly more [dense](density.md) than [water](water.md)}}.

### solubility

Amides {{that are small are [soluble](solubility.md) in [water](water.md)}}. Solubility {{decreases}} the larger the amide.
