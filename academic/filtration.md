# filtration

__Filtration__ is {{a physical [separation process](separation%20process.md) that separates [solid](solid.md) from [fluid](fluid.md) in a [mixture](mixture.md) using a _[filter medium](#filter%20medium)_}}. Solid that cannot pass through is called the {{_residue_}} and fluid that passes through is called the {{_filtrate_}}. <!--SR:!2023-05-21,18,210!2023-06-03,44,290!2023-06-07,47,290-->

## filter medium

A filter medium is {{a material used to separate}}. <!--SR:!2023-06-03,47,290-->

There are two main types of filter media: {{_surface filter_, a solid [sieve](sieve.md) that traps the solid with or without [filter paper](filter%20paper.md)}}, and {{_depth filter_, a bed of granular material retaining the solid as they pass through}}. <!--SR:!2023-05-19,31,270!2023-05-31,17,250-->
