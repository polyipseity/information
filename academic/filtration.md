# filtration

__Filtration__ is {{a physical [separation process](separation%20process.md) that separates [solid](solid.md) from [fluid](fluid.md) in a [mixture](mixture.md) using a _[filter medium](#filter%20medium)_}}. Solid that cannot pass through is called the {{_residue_}} and fluid that passes through is called the {{_filtrate_}}. <!--SR:!2023-04-25,14,230!2023-04-20,15,290!2023-04-21,16,290-->

## filter medium

A filter medium is {{a material used to separate}}. <!--SR:!2023-04-16,12,270-->

There are two main types of filter media: {{_surface filter_, a solid [sieve](sieve.md) that traps the solid with or without [filter paper](filter%20paper.md)}}, and {{_depth filter_, a bed of granular material retaining the solid as they pass through}}. <!--SR:!2023-04-18,10,270!2023-05-14,30,270-->
