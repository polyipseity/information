In [chemistry](chemistry.md), the enthalpy of reaction is {{the heat change of reaction under constant [pressure](pressure.md) and [temperature](temperature.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-04-04,3,250-->

For [endothermic processes](endothermic%20process.md), {{heat is absorbed while for [exothermic processes](exothermic%20process.md), heat is released}}. <!--SR:!2023-04-04,3,250-->
