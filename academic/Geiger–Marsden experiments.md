# Geiger–Marsden experiments

The __{{Geiger–Marsden}} experiments__ (also known as the __{{Rutherford}} gold foil experiment__) were {{a series of experiments}} that led to {{the development of the [Rutherford model](Rutherford%20model.md)}} in {{1911}}. It was directed by {{[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md)}} in {{1909}}. <!--SR:!2023-08-03,162,290!2023-05-17,90,270!2023-11-24,244,310!2023-04-28,90,270!2023-05-08,92,270!2023-06-21,142,290!2023-09-19,210,310-->

## experiment

A thin gold foil are {{bombarded by [alpha particles](alpha%20particle.md) in an evacuated chamber}}. The {{deflection angles}} are recorded. <!--SR:!2023-05-15,44,210!2023-06-02,127,290-->

### results

Most alpha particles pass through {{with minimal deflection}}. Few of them pass through {{with large deflection}}. Even fewer {{rebound back}}. <!--SR:!2023-12-06,278,330!2023-07-14,148,290!2023-05-19,104,270-->

### implications

The results showed that the {{[plum pudding model](plum%20pudding%20model.md)}} was wrong. Most of the volume of an atom is {{empty}} as {{most alpha particles pass through with minimal deflection}}. Instead, {{the positive charge is concentrated in a tiny central region called the "nucleus"}}. {{Most mass is concentrated there}} as {{the nucleus is not deflected or moved by particles}}. Electrons, which {{does not affect}} the scattering, orbit around the nucleus. This is the {{[Rutherford model](Rutherford%20model.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-06-03,119,290!2023-12-07,277,330!2023-05-17,101,270!2023-05-18,91,230!2023-04-07,75,250!2023-04-24,62,230!2023-08-21,139,310!2023-11-10,256,330-->
