# carboxylic acid

## physical properties

### boiling and melting points

Due to [hydrogen bonding](hydrogen%20bond.md) and {{formation of [dimers](dimer%20(chemistry).md)}}, carboxylic acids have {{higher [boiling points](boiling%20point.md) and [melting points](melting%20point.md) than comparable [alcohols](alcohol.md)}}. They also have {{higher [boiling points](boiling%20point.md) than [water](water.md)}}.

### density

Carboxylic acids are {{less [dense](density.md) than [water](water.md) except for [formic acid](formic%20acid.md) and [acetic acid](acetic%20acid.md)}}. Density {{decreases}} with increasing size.

### odor

Carboxylic acids have {{a characteristic pungent smell and sour taste}}.

### solubility

Carboxylic acids {{that are small (1 to 4 carbons) are [miscible](miscibility.md) with [water](water.md) in all proportions}}. Solubility {{decreases}} the larger the carboxylic acid.
