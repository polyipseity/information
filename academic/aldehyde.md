# aldehyde

## physical properties

### boiling and melting points

Due to increased [polarizability](polarizability.md), aldehydes have {{[boiling points](boiling%20point.md) and [melting points](melting%20point.md) in between comparable [alkanes](alkane.md) and [alcohols](alcohol.md)}}.

### density

Most aldehydes are {{less [dense](density.md) than [water](water.md)}}. Density {{increases}} with increasing size.

### odor

Most aldehydes have {{an unpleasant and pungent smell}}.

### solubility

Aldehydes {{that are small are [soluble](solubility.md) in [water](water.md)}}. Solubility {{decreases}} the larger the aldehyde.
