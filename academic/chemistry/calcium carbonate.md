# calcium carbonate

__Calcium carbonate__, also known as {{limestone}}, is a solid [ionic compound](ionic%20compound.md). Its molecular formula is {{CaCO<sub>3</sub>}}. It looks like a {{white solid}}.

## reactions

Calcium carbonate {{decomposes under heating}}.
> {{CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) $\xrightarrow{\text{heat}}$ CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)}}

It also {{reacts with acids}}.
> {{CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2HCl(aq) â†’ CaCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)}}

### tests

To test for calcium carbonate, both {{calcium ions and carbonate ions}} are tested for. The former can be detected by the {{[flame test](flame%20test.mmd)}}, in which a {{brick red flame}} can be observed. The latter can be tested by adding {{[dilute hydrochloric acid](dilute%20hydrochloric%20acid)}}, in which {{colorless gas}} that {{turns [limewater](calcium%20hydroxide.md) milky}} is given out.
