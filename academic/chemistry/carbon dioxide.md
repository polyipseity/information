## reactions

### tests

Carbon dioxide can be tested using {{calcium compounds or [hydrogencarbonate indicator](hydrogencarbonate%20indicator.md)}}.

#### calcium compounds

When carbon dioxide is {{passed into aqueous [calcium hydroxide](calcium%20hydroxide.md) solution}}, {{solid [calcium carbonate](calcium%20carbonate.md) and [water](water.md)}} is formed. {{Formation of white precipitates}} can be observed. When {{excess}} carbon dioxide is passed into the solution, {{calcium carbonate reacts with carbon dioxide and water}} to give {{[calcium hydrogencarbonate](calcium%20hydrogencarbonate.md)}}. {{Dissolution of white precipitates}} can be observed.
> 1. {{Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>(aq) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) → CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)}}
> 2. {{CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) → Ca(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(aq)}}

### hydrogencarbonate indicator

When carbon dioxide is {{passed into hydrogencarbonate indicator}}, color of the indicator turns from {{red to yellow}}.
