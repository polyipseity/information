# air separation

__Air separation__ {{separates [atmospheric air](atmosphere%20of%20Earth.md) into its components}}. It is carried out in {{an air separation plant}}.

The most common method is [cryogenic distillation](#cryogenic%20distillation).

## cryogenic distillation

- See also: [fractional distillation](fractional%20distillation.md).

Pure gases are separated by {{cooling air until it [liquefies](liquefaction.md). Then [distill](distillation.md) the components at their boiling points.}}
