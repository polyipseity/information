# photon

A __photon__ is ==a [quantum](quantum.md) of the [electromagnetic field](electromagnetic%20field.md)==. <!--SR:!2022-12-05,3,250-->

## properties

A photon ==cannot be subdivided and is [massless](massless%20particle.md)==. It carries ==[energy](energy.md) $E$ proportional to its [frequency](frequency.md) $f$==:
==$$E=hf$$==
where ==$h$ is the [Planck constant](Planck%20constant.md)==. <!--SR:!2022-12-05,3,250!2022-12-05,3,250!2022-12-06,4,270!2022-12-06,4,270-->

As photons are massless, they ==always move at the [speed of light in vacuum](speed%20of%20light.md), 299&nbsp;792&nbsp;458&nbsp;m/s==. <!--SR:!2022-12-05,3,250-->
