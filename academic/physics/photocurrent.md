# photocurrent

__Photocurrent__ is ==the [electric current](electric%20current.md) through a [photosensitive](photosensitivity.md) device due to exposure to [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md)==. It may be caused by ==[photoelectric effect](photoelectric%20effect.md) or [photovoltaic effect](photovoltaic%20effect.md)==. <!--SR:!2022-12-08,7,250!2022-12-09,8,250-->

## calculation

The photocurrent can be calculated by the following equation:
==$$I_p=\frac{Q}t$$==
where ==$Q$ is the [electric charge](electric%20charge.md) transferred over time $t$==. If $Q$ is in [coulombs](coulomb.md) and $t$ is in [seconds](second.md), $I_p$ is in [amperes](ampere.md). <!--SR:!2022-12-19,17,290!2022-12-08,7,250-->

## external voltage

By applying an external [voltage](voltage.md), the photocurrent can be ==changed==. A voltage that increases the photocurrent (==positive voltage==) is called ==accelerating potential==, while the inverse (==negative voltage==) is called ==retarding potential==. <!--SR:!2022-12-11,10,250!2022-12-16,14,290!2022-12-13,12,270!2022-12-19,17,290!2022-12-17,15,290-->

An accelerating potential ==increases the photocurrent==, but only up to a point called ==saturation current $I_s$==. The potential ==attracts electrons to the anode==, ==increasing the number of captured electrons==, thus the photocurrent. The saturation current is reached when ==no more additional electrons can be captured==. <!--SR:!2022-12-09,8,250!2022-12-18,16,290!2022-12-10,9,250!2022-12-10,9,250!2022-12-10,9,250-->

An retarding potential ==decreases the photocurrent==. By increasing the retarding potential, when the photocurrent ==just reach zero==, the potential at that point is called ==stopping potential or cut-off potential $V_0$==. The potential ==repels electrons==, ==preventing all but high-energy electrons from reaching the anode==, thus decreasing the photocurrent. When the stopping potential is reached, ==even the most energetic electron of kinetic energy $K_\mathrm{max}$ is stopped==, so the photocurrent is zero. In this case, the stopping potential is related by ==$\mathrm{e}V_0=K_\mathrm{max}$==. <!--SR:!2022-12-04,2,250!2022-12-11,10,250!2022-12-11,10,250!2022-12-08,7,250!2022-12-09,8,250!2022-12-06,5,230!2022-12-07,6,250-->

The resulting photocurrent-voltage curve is ==[sigmoidal](sigmoid%20function.md)==. <!--SR:!2022-12-17,15,290-->
