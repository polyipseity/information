# Bohr model

The __Bohr model__ or __{{Rutherford–Bohr}} model__ is {{an [atom](atom.md) model}} where {{a small, dense [nucleus](nucleus.md) is orbited by [electrons](electron.md)}}. They are attracted by {{electrostatic forces}}. It was presented by {{[Niels Bohr](Niels%20Bohr.md)}} and {{[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md)}} in {{1913}}.

The model gives almost exact results only when {{two charged points orbit each other much slower than light}}, like {{an atom where one electron is far away from everything else}}.

## postulates

The model is based on three postulates:

1. The electron revolves at {{certain orbits only with certain distances from the nucleus called stationary orbits}} {{without radiating energy}}. ^23e80f
2. The stationary orbits have distances {{for which the revolving electron has an [angular momentum](angular%20momentum.md) of an integer multiple of the reduced [Planck constant](Planck%20constant.md): $m_\mathrm{e}vr=n\hbar$}}, where {{$n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ is called the [principal quantum number](principal%20quantum%20number.md)}}. The orbits have definite energies called {{[energy levels](energy%20level.md), energy shells, or energy states}}. ^f5a73f
3. Electrons only gain or lose energy by {{jumping from one stationary orbit to another}}. [Electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) of frequency $\nu$ is respectively {{absorbed or emitted}} according to the {{[Planck relation](Planck%20relation.md): $\Delta{}E=E_2-E_1=h\nu$}}, where {{$h$ is the [Planck constant](Planck%20constant)}}.

## electron energy levels

By the [first postulate](#^23e80f), the {{[centripetal force](centripetal%20force.md) equals the [Coulomb force](Coulomb%20force.md)}}. Assuming {{the nucleus mass is much larger than the electron mass}}:
{{$$\frac{m_\mathrm{e}v^2}r=\frac{Zk_\mathrm{e}\mathrm{e}^2}{r^2}$$}}
where {{$m_\mathrm{e}$ is the electron mass, $\mathrm{e}$ is the [elementary charge](elementary%20charge.md), $k_\mathrm{e}$ is the [Coulomb constant](Coulomb%20constant.md), and $Z$ is the atomic number of the atom}}. Rearranging, this equation determines the electron's speed from its radius:
{{$$v=\sqrt{\frac{Zk_\mathrm{e}\mathrm{e}^2}{m_\mathrm{e}r} }$$}}
Substitute the equation into {{the equation from the [second postulate](#^f5a73f)}}:
{{$$m_\mathrm{e}\sqrt{\frac{Zk_\mathrm{e}\mathrm{e}^2}{m_\mathrm{e}r} }r=n\hbar$$}}
We can get the radius in terms of $n$:
{{$$r_n=\frac{n^2\hbar^2}{Zk_\mathrm{e}\mathrm{e}^2m_\mathrm{e} }$$}}
and energy in terms of $n$:
{{$$E_n=-\frac12m_\mathrm{e}v^2=-\frac{Zk_\mathrm{e}\mathrm{e}^2}{2r_n}=-\frac{Z^2k_\mathrm{e}^2\mathrm{e}^4m_\mathrm{e} }{2\hbar^2n^2}\approx\frac{-13.6Z^2}{n^2}~\mathrm{eV}$$}}
