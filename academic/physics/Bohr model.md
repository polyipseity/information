# Bohr model

The __Bohr model__ or __{{Rutherford–Bohr}} model__ is {{an [atom](atom.md) model}} where {{a small, dense [nucleus](nucleus.md) is orbited by [electrons](electron.md)}}. They are attracted by {{electrostatic forces}}. It was presented by {{[Niels Bohr](Niels%20Bohr.md)}} and {{[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md)}} in {{1913}}. <!--SR:!2022-12-28,10,250!2022-12-19,4,270!2022-12-20,2,230!2022-12-30,12,270!2022-12-27,9,252!2022-12-19,4,272!2022-12-19,4,272-->

The model gives almost exact results only when {{two charged points orbit each other much slower than light}}, like {{an atom where one electron is far away from everything else}}. <!--SR:!2022-12-28,10,252!2022-12-19,4,272-->

## postulates

The model is based on three postulates:

1. The electron revolves at {{certain orbits only with certain distances from the nucleus called stationary orbits}} {{without radiating energy}}.
2. The stationary orbits have distances {{for which the revolving electron has an [angular momentum](angular%20momentum.md) of an integer multiple of the reduced [Planck constant](Planck%20constant.md): $m_\mathrm{e}vr=n\hbar$}}, where {{$n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ is called the [principal quantum number](principal%20quantum%20number.md)}}. The orbits have definite energies called {{[energy levels](energy%20level.md), energy shells, or energy states}}.
3. Electrons only gain or lose energy by {{jumping from one stationary orbit to another}}. [Electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) of frequency $\nu$ is respectively {{absorbed or emitted}} according to the {{[Planck relation](Planck%20relation.md): $\Delta{}E=E_2-E_1=h\nu$}}, where {{$h$ is the [Planck constant](Planck%20constant)}}. <!--SR:!2022-12-20,2,230!2022-12-19,4,270!2022-12-20,2,230!2022-12-20,2,230!2022-12-20,2,230!2022-12-28,10,252!2022-12-31,13,272!2022-12-20,2,232!2022-12-19,4,272-->
