# Geiger–Marsden experiments

The __==Geiger–Marsden== experiments__ (also known as the __==Rutherford== gold foil experiment__) were a ==series of experiments that led to the development of the [Rutherford model](Rutherford%20model.md) in 1911==. It was directed by ==[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md) in 1909==. <!--SR:!2022-12-15,3,250!2022-12-15,4,270!2022-12-16,2,230!2022-12-16,2,230-->

## experiment

A thin gold foil are ==bombarded by [alpha particles](alpha%20particle.md) in an evacuated chamber==. The ==exiting directions of the particles== are recorded. <!--SR:!2022-12-24,10,250!2022-12-23,9,250-->

### results

Most alpha particles pass through ==with minimal deflection==. Few of them pass through ==with large deflection==. Even fewer ==bounces back==. <!--SR:!2022-12-15,4,270!2022-12-27,13,270!2022-12-26,12,270-->

### implications

The results indicated that the ==[plum pudding model](plum%20pudding%20model.md)== was wrong and most volume of an atom is ==empty== as ==most alpha particles pass through with minimal deflection==. Instead, it indicated that ==the positive charge is concentrated in a tiny central region called the "nucleus"==. ==Most mass is concentrated there== as ==the nucleus is not deflected or moved by particles==. Electrons, which ==does not affect== the scattering, orbit around the nucleus. This is the ==[Rutherford model](Rutherford%20model.md)==. <!--SR:!2022-12-25,11,270!2022-12-15,4,270!2022-12-15,4,270!2022-12-16,2,230!2022-12-24,10,250!2022-12-22,8,250!2022-12-15,4,270!2022-12-15,4,270-->
