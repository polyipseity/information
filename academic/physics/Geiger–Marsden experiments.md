# Geiger–Marsden experiments

The __{{Geiger–Marsden}} experiments__ (also known as the __{{Rutherford}} gold foil experiment__) were {{a series of experiments}} that led to {{the development of the [Rutherford model](Rutherford%20model.md)}} in {{1911}}. It was directed by {{[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md)}} in {{1909}}. <!--SR:!2023-02-22,55,290!2023-02-14,33,270!2023-03-25,77,310!2023-01-27,33,270!2023-02-05,35,270!2023-01-30,36,270!2023-02-18,49,290-->

## experiment

A thin gold foil are {{bombarded by [alpha particles](alpha%20particle.md) in an evacuated chamber}}. The {{deflection angles}} are recorded. <!--SR:!2023-02-02,15,230!2023-06-02,127,290-->

### results

Most alpha particles pass through {{with minimal deflection}}. Few of them pass through {{with large deflection}}. Even fewer {{rebound back}}. <!--SR:!2023-03-03,63,310!2023-02-16,51,290!2023-02-03,38,270-->

### implications

The results showed that the {{[plum pudding model](plum%20pudding%20model.md)}} was wrong. Most of the volume of an atom is {{empty}} as {{most alpha particles pass through with minimal deflection}}. Instead, {{the positive charge is concentrated in a tiny central region called the "nucleus"}}. {{Most mass is concentrated there}} as {{the nucleus is not deflected or moved by particles}}. Electrons, which {{does not affect}} the scattering, orbit around the nucleus. This is the {{[Rutherford model](Rutherford%20model.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-02-04,41,290!2023-03-05,64,310!2023-02-05,38,270!2023-02-16,40,230!2023-04-07,75,250!2023-02-19,26,230!2023-03-02,62,310!2023-02-26,59,310-->
