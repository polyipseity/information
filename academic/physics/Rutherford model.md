# Rutherford model

The __==Rutherford== model__ is ==a historical scientific model of the [atom](atom.md)==. The model has ==[electrons](electron.md) orbiting around a tiny and heavy central positive charge called the "[nucleus](nucleus.md)"==. It was first proposed by ==[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md)== in ==1911==. <!--SR:!2022-12-31,16,290!2022-12-26,11,275!2022-12-20,6,235!2022-12-21,7,255!2022-12-15,1,250-->

## problems

Orbiting electrons ==undergo acceleration==, so ==[electromagnetic waves](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) should be emitted==. The electrons ==lose energy==, ==spiralling inwards and collapsing into the nucleus==. This is problematic as ==the model implies all atoms are unstable==. Also, as the electrons spiral inwards, ==the frequency of emission increases== as ==the orbital period becomes shorter==, so ==a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiation should be emitted==. However, it is observed that ==radiation are emitted at discrete frequencies==. <!--SR:!2022-12-26,12,270!2022-12-23,9,250!2022-12-27,13,270!2022-12-17,2,250!2023-01-01,17,290!2022-12-24,10,255!2022-12-15,1,250!2022-12-23,9,255!2022-12-22,8,255-->
