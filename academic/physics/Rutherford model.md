# Rutherford model

The __{{Rutherford}} model__ is {{a historical scientific model of the [atom](atom.md)}}. The model has {{[electrons](electron.md) orbiting around a tiny and heavy central positive charge called the "[nucleus](nucleus.md)"}}. It was first proposed by {{[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md)}} in {{1911}}. <!--SR:!2023-03-06,65,310!2023-08-26,195,315!2023-05-20,76,215!2023-03-26,70,275!2023-03-11,45,250-->

## problems

Orbiting electrons {{undergo acceleration}}, so {{[electromagnetic waves](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) should be emitted}}. The electrons {{lose energy}}, {{spiralling inwards and collapsing into the nucleus}}. This is problematic as {{the model implies all atoms are unstable}}. Also, as the electrons spiral inwards, {{the frequency of emission increases}} as {{the orbital period becomes shorter}}, so {{a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiation should be emitted}}. However, it is observed that {{radiation are emitted at discrete frequencies}}. <!--SR:!2023-05-05,93,270!2023-04-27,91,270!2023-10-05,226,310!2023-04-15,80,270!2023-03-22,27,270!2023-03-11,34,235!2023-05-03,91,270!2023-05-06,98,275!2023-03-20,64,255-->
