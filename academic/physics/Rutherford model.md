# Rutherford model

The __==Rutherford== model__ is a ==historical scientific model of the [atom](atom.md)==. The model has ==[electrons](electron.md) orbiting around a relatively tiny and heavy concentrated central charge called the "[nucleus](nucleus.md)"==. It was first proposed by ==[Ernest Rutherford](Ernest%20Rutherford.md) in 1911==.

## problems

The orbiting of electrons ==implies acceleration==, so ==[electromagnetic waves](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) should be emitted==. The electrons ==lose energy== by said emission, ==spiralling inwards and collapsing into the nucleus==. This is problematic as ==the model implies all atoms are unstable==. Also, as the electrons spiral inwards, ==the frequency of emission increases as the orbital period becomes shorter==, so ==a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiation should be emitted==. However, observations indicate that ==radiation are emitted at discrete frequencies==.
