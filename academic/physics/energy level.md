# energy level

A {{[bound](bound%20state.md) [quantum mechanical](quantum%20mechanics.md) system or [particle](particle.md)}} can only have {{certain discrete values of energy}}, called __energy levels__. <!--SR:!2023-01-18,22,250!2022-12-29,9,250-->

The lowest possible energy level is called the {{_[ground state](ground%20state.md)_}}, while all other higher energy levels are called {{_[excited states](excited%20state.md)_}}. <!--SR:!2023-01-04,16,290!2023-01-03,15,290-->
