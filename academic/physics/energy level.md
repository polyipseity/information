# energy level

A ==[bound](bound%20state.md) [quantum mechanical](quantum%20mechanics.md) system or [particle](particle.md)== can only have ==certain discrete values of energy==, called __energy levels__.

The lowest possible energy level is called the ==_[ground state](ground%20state.md)_==, while all other higher energy levels are called ==_[excited states](excited%20state.md)_==.
