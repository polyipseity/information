# photoelectric effect

The __photoelectric effect__ is ==the ejection of [electrons](electron.md) from a material when [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) strikes it==. <!--SR:!2022-12-13,12,270-->

## observation

A ==[photocell](photocell.md)== can be used to observe the effect. It consists of ==a photosensitive metal, the [photocathode](photocathode.md), curving around an [anode](anode.md) inside an [evacuated](vacuum.md) glass tube==. When the photocathode is shone by light, ==emitted electrons escape to the anode, producing an [electric current](electric%20current.md)==. The current is called ==photoelectric current, a kind of [photocurrent](photocurrent.md)==. <!--SR:!2022-12-13,12,270!2022-12-08,7,250!2022-12-03,3,230!2022-12-14,13,270-->

If the light frequency is lower than the ==threshold frequency==, ==no photoemission occurs==. Otherwise, ==immediate photoemission occurs==. ==Light [intensity](intensity.md) or duration of exposure== does not affect photoemission of a single electron. ==Light intensity== only affects the photoelectric current. <!--SR:!2022-12-18,16,290!2022-12-12,11,270!2022-12-14,13,270!2022-12-13,12,270!2022-12-12,11,270-->

Emitted electrons have ==different== initial kinetic energies. The maximum kinetic energy of an electron ==increases with light frequency== given that the threshold frequency is exceeded. <!--SR:!2022-12-17,15,290!2022-12-12,11,270-->

## mechanism

The classical [wave model](electromagnetic%20radiation.md#wave%20model) predicts that when ==continuous radiation passes through an electron==, ==the electron gains [kinetic energy](kinentic%20energy.md), vibrating with increasing amplitude==. After ==some time==, when enough energy is accumulated, ==the electron is emitted==. The energy gain increases when ==light intensity increases==. However, ==[observations](#observation) disagree with said prediction==. <!--SR:!2022-12-09,8,250!2022-12-07,6,250!2022-12-14,13,270!2022-12-14,13,270!2022-12-14,13,270!2022-12-13,12,270-->

The ==threshold frequency $V_o$== is determined by ==the [work function](work%20function.md) $\Phi$ of the surface of the material==:
==$$\begin{aligned}\Phi&=hV_o\\
V_o&=\frac\Phi{h}\end{aligned}$$==
where ==$h$ is the [Planck constant](Planck%20constant.md)==. <!--SR:!2022-12-05,3,262!2022-12-05,3,262!2022-12-05,3,262-->

The ==maximum kinetic energy $K_\mathrm{max}$== is determined by ==the frequency $f$ of the incoming photon and the work function $\Phi$ of the surface of the material==:
==$$K_\mathrm{max}=hf-\Phi=hf-hV_o=h\left(f-V_o\right)$$==
where ==$h$ is the Planck constant==. <!--SR:!2022-12-06,4,281!2022-12-06,4,281!2022-12-06,4,281!2022-12-06,4,281-->

Given the threshold frequency is reached, increasing intensity only ==increases the number of [photons](photon.md) hitting the surface, increasing photoemission, hence photoelectric current==. <!--SR:!2022-12-03,1,242-->
