# photoelectric effect

The __photoelectric effect__ is {{the ejection of [electrons](electron.md) from a material when [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) strikes it}}.

## observation

A {{[photocell](photocell.md)}} can be used to observe the effect. It consists of {{a [photocathode](photocathode.md), curving around an [anode](anode.md) inside an [evacuated](vacuum.md) glass tube}}. When the photocathode is shone by light, {{emitted electrons escape to the anode}}, {{producing an [electric current](electric%20current.md)}}. The current is called {{photoelectric current, a kind of [photocurrent](photocurrent.md)}}.

If the light frequency is lower than the {{threshold frequency}}, {{no photoemission occurs}}. Otherwise, {{immediate photoemission occurs}}. {{Light [intensity](intensity.md) or duration of exposure}} does not affect photoemission of a single electron. {{Light intensity}} only affects the photoelectric current.

Emitted electrons have {{different}} initial kinetic energies. The maximum kinetic energy of an electron {{increases with light frequency}} given that the threshold frequency is exceeded.

## mechanism

The classical [wave model](electromagnetic%20radiation.md#wave%20model) predicts that when {{continuous radiation passes through an electron}}, {{the electron gains [kinetic energy](kinentic%20energy.md)}}, {{vibrating with increasing amplitude}}. After {{some time}}, when enough energy is accumulated, {{the electron is emitted}}. The energy gain increases when {{light intensity increases}}. However, {{[observations](#observation) disagree}}.

The {{threshold frequency $\nu_o$}} is determined by {{the [work function](work%20function.md) $\Phi$ of the surface of the material}}:
{{$$\begin{aligned}\Phi&=h\nu_o\\\nu_o&=\frac\Phi{h}\end{aligned}$$}}
where {{$h$ is the [Planck constant](Planck%20constant.md)}}.

The {{maximum kinetic energy $K_\mathrm{max}$}} is determined by {{the frequency $f$ of the incoming photon and the work function $\Phi$ of the surface of the material}}:
{{$$K_\mathrm{max}=hf-\Phi=hf-hV_o=h\left(f-V_o\right)$$}}
where {{$h$ is the Planck constant}}.

Given the threshold frequency is reached, increasing intensity only {{increases the number of [photons](photon.md) hitting the surface}}, {{increasing photoemission}}, {{hence photoelectric current}}.
