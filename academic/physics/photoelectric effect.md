# photoelectric effect

The __photoelectric effect__ is {{the ejection of [electrons](electron.md) from a material when [electromagnetic radiation](electromagnetic%20radiation.md) strikes it}}. <!--SR:!2023-01-18,36,270-->

## observation

A {{[photocell](photocell.md)}} can be used to observe the effect. It consists of {{a [photocathode](photocathode.md), curving around an [anode](anode.md) inside an [evacuated](vacuum.md) glass tube}}. When the photocathode is shone by light, {{emitted electrons escape to the anode}}, {{producing an [electric current](electric%20current.md)}}. The current is called {{photoelectric current, a kind of [photocurrent](photocurrent.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-01-18,36,270!2023-02-19,52,250!2023-02-04,36,270!2023-02-16,48,230!2023-01-20,37,270-->

If the light frequency is lower than the {{threshold frequency}}, {{no photoemission occurs}}. Otherwise, {{immediate photoemission occurs}}. {{Light [intensity](intensity.md) or duration of exposure}} does not affect photoemission of a single electron. {{Light intensity}} only affects the photoelectric current. <!--SR:!2023-02-22,66,310!2023-01-22,41,290!2023-02-01,49,290!2023-01-17,35,270!2023-01-13,32,270-->

Emitted electrons have {{different}} initial kinetic energies. The maximum kinetic energy of an electron {{increases with light frequency}} given that the threshold frequency is exceeded. <!--SR:!2023-02-17,62,310!2023-01-11,24,270-->

## mechanism

The classical [wave model](electromagnetic%20radiation.md#wave%20model) predicts that when {{continuous radiation passes through an electron}}, {{the electron gains [kinetic energy](kinentic%20energy.md)}}, {{vibrating with increasing amplitude}}. After {{some time}}, when enough energy is accumulated, {{the electron is emitted}}. The energy gain increases when {{light intensity increases}}. However, {{[observations](#observation) disagree}}. <!--SR:!2023-01-01,23,250!2023-02-07,45,250!2023-01-03,15,290!2023-01-21,38,270!2023-01-21,38,270!2023-01-22,39,270!2023-01-14,32,270-->

The {{threshold frequency $\nu_o$}} is determined by {{the [work function](work%20function.md) $\Phi$ of the surface of the material}}:
{{$$\begin{aligned}\Phi&=\nu_o\\\nu_o&=\frac\Phi{h}\end{aligned}$$}}
where {{$h$ is the [Planck constant](Planck%20constant.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-01-11,27,262!2023-01-24,39,282!2023-01-02,10,270!2023-02-22,63,302-->

The {{maximum kinetic energy $K_\mathrm{max}$}} is determined by {{the frequency $f$ of the incoming photon and the work function $\Phi$ of the surface of the material}}:
{{$$K_\mathrm{max}=hf-\Phi=hf-hV_o=h\left(f-V_o\right)$$}}
where {{$h$ is the Planck constant}}. <!--SR:!2023-02-03,47,301!2023-01-21,35,281!2023-02-12,55,301!2023-03-09,75,321-->

Given the threshold frequency is reached, increasing intensity only {{increases the number of [photons](photon.md) hitting the surface}}, {{increasing photoemission}}, {{hence photoelectric current}}. <!--SR:!2023-01-20,28,222!2023-01-01,13,270!2023-01-05,17,290-->
