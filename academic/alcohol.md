# alcohol

## physical properties

### boiling and melting points

Due to [hydrogen bonding](hydrogen%20bond.md), alcohols have {{higher [boiling points](boiling%20point.md), higher [melting points](melting%20point.md), and higher [solubility](solubility.md) in [water](water.md) than comparable [alkanes](alkane.md)}}.

### density

Most alcohols are less [dense](density.md) {{than [water](water.md). Alcohols with multiple [hydroxyl groups](hydroxyl%20group.md) are more dense than water}}.

### solubility

{{[Methanol](methanol.md), [ethanol](ethanol.md), and [propanol](propanol.md)}} are [miscible](miscibility.md) with water in all proportions, while {{[butanol](butanol.md) is moderately water soluble}}.
