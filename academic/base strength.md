__Base strength__ is {{the tendency of a [base](base.md) to [dissociate](dissociation%20(chemistry).md)}}. Strong bases {{dissociate effectively completely in [solutions](solution%20(chemistry).md)}}. Weak bases {{dissociates partially in solutions}}. <!--SR:!2023-06-04,53,290!2023-06-11,58,310!2023-06-26,70,310-->
