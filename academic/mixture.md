# mixture

A __mixture__ is {{a matter made up of multiple [chemical substances](chemical%20substance.md) which are not chemically bonded}}. It is impure. <!--SR:!2023-04-20,9,230-->

## properties

Compare with [chemical substance ยง properties](chemical%20substance.md#properties).

- composition: {{variable}}
- formation: {{no [chemical reactions](chemical%20reaction.md), no to little energy change ([enthalpy of mixing](enthalpy%20of%20mixing.md))}}
- properties: {{each constituent keep their properties}}
- separation: {{separable by physical and chemical methods}}
- [boiling point](boiling%20point.md) and [melting point](melting%20point.md): {{wide}} <!--SR:!2023-05-24,36,270!2023-05-02,20,250!2023-06-10,53,290!2023-04-22,16,290!2023-06-14,56,310-->

## uniformity

A mixture is {{either _[homogeneous](#homogeneous%20mixture)_ or _[heterogeneous](#heterogeneous%20mixture)_}}. <!--SR:!2023-04-28,11,250-->

### homogeneous mixture

A homogeneous mixture has {{uniformly distributed constituents}}. <!--SR:!2023-05-11,27,270-->
