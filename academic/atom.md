# atom

An __atom__ is {{a [particle](particle.md) consisting of a [nucleus](nucleus.md) of [neutrons](neutron.md) and [protons](proton.md) surrounded by a cloud of [electrons](electron.md)}}. It is a basic particle {{of [chemical elements](chemical%20element.md)}}.

Atoms are extremely small, {{typically 100 [picometers](picometer.md) across}}.

If the number of electrons and protons are equal, the atom is {{electrically neutral}}. Otherwise, the atom is called {{an [ion](ion.md)}}.
