# iron(III) oxide-hydroxide

__Iron(III) oxide-hydroxide__ is {{an [inorganic compound](inorganic%20compound.md) with the [chemical formula](chemical%20formula.md) [Fe](iron.md)[O](oxygen.md)([OH](hydroxide.md))}}. It looks like {{reddish brown [crystals](crystal.md)}}.

It is often seen as {{one of its [hydrates](hydrate.md), FeO(OH)·_n_[H<sub>2</sub>O](water.md)}}. The {{monohydrate FeO(OH)·H<sub>2</sub>O is often called __iron(III) hydroxide__ Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>}}.

## preparation

Treating {{iron(III) [salts](salt%20(chemistry).md) with a [base](base%20(chemistry).md) [precipitates](precipitate.md) out reddish brown iron(III) hydroxide}}:

> treating with [bases](base%20(chemistry).md)
> - {{Fe<sup>3+</sup>(aq) + 3OH<sup>-</sup>(aq) → Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>(s)}}
