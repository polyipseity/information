# fractional distillation

__Fractional distillation__ {{is a form of [distillation](distillation.md) that separates a [mixture](mixture.md) into [fractions](fraction%20(chemistry).md)}}. It {{heats the mixture to a [temperature](temperature.md) at which some fractions [vaporize](vaporize.md)}}. It is used when the components have [boiling points](boiling%20point.md) that {{differ by less than 25 °C (45 °F) under a [pressure](pressure.md) of one [atmosphere](atmosphere%20(unit).md)}}. Otherwise, {{[simple distillation](simple%20distillation.md)}} is used. <!--SR:!2023-04-26,12,250!2023-05-08,15,210!2023-04-29,12,230!2023-07-01,70,310-->
