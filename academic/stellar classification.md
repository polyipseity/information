# stellar classification

In the {{Morganâ€“Keenan (MK) system}}, [stars](star.md) are classified, {{from the hottest to the coldest, _O_, _B_, _A_, _F_, _G_, _K_, and _M_, with each letter subvided by adding a numeric digit with _0_ being the hottest and _9_ being the coolest}}. It has been expanded to include {{other stars and star-like objects that do not fit in the classical system, like class _D_ for [white dwarfs](white%20dwarf.md) and classes _S_ and _C_ for [carbon stars](carbon%20star.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-05-11,2,230!2023-05-12,4,270!2023-05-12,4,270-->
