# ionic bond

__Ionic bonding__ is {{a type of [chemical bonding](chemical%20bond.md) involving the [electrostatic attraction](Coulomb's%20law.md) between oppositely charged [ions](ion.md) or [atoms](atom.md) with greatly differing [electronegativity](electronegativity.md)}}. It is the primary interaction in {{[ionic compounds](ionic%20compound.md)}}. {{A transfer of [electrons](electron.md)}} takes place, which is also known as {{__electrovalence__ in contrast to [covalence](covalent%20bond.md)}}. Atoms that {{gain electrons become [anions](ion.md) while those that lose electrons become [cations](ion.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-04-24,10,210!2023-06-19,60,310!2023-06-20,60,310!2023-06-09,51,290!2023-04-22,16,290-->
