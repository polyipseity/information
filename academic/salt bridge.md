# salt bridge

__Salt bridge__ is {{a device connecting the two [half-cells](half-cell.md) of a [galvanic cell](galvanic%20cell.md)}}. It {{maintains electrical neutrality in the internal circuit}}. It comes in two main types: {{glass tubes and [filter paper](filter%20paper.md), both soaked with a relatively [inert](chemically%20inert.md) [electrolyte](electrolyte.md)}}. <!--SR:!2023-04-23,11,230!2023-05-10,25,270!2023-05-02,19,250-->

The inert electrolyte is usually {{a combination of [potassium](potassium.md) or [ammonium](ammonium.md) [cations](ion.md) and [chloride](chloride.md) or [nitrate](nitrate.md) [anions](ion.md)}}, chosen such that {{it does not react with other chemicals used in the cell}}. <!--SR:!2023-05-17,29,270!2023-04-24,17,290-->
