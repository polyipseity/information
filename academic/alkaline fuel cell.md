# alkaline fuel cell

The __alkaline fuel cell__ (__AFC__) is {{a [fuel cell](fuel%20cell.md) that consumes [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) and pure [oxygen](oxygen.md) to produce [water](water.md), [electricity](electricity.md), and [heat](heat.md)}}. It has an efficiency of {{70%}}.

## chemistry

Energy is produced through {{a [redox reaction](redox%20reaction.md) between [hydrogen](hydrogen.md) and [oxygen](oxygen.md) in hot concentrated [alkaline](alkali.md) [electrolyte](electrolyte.md) such as [potassium hydroxide](potassium%20hydroxide.md) with a temperature in between ambient temperature and 90 °C}}:

> - [anode](anode.md): {{H<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2OH<sup>-</sup>(aq) → 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + 2e<sup>-</sup>}}
> - [cathode](cathode.md): {{O<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + 4e<sup>-</sup> → 4OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)}}
> - overall: {{2H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)}}

Electrodes {{are porous to allow hydrogen, oxygen, and [water](water.md) to flow in and out. They are made of [nickel](nickel.md) or [platinum](platinum.md) to catalyze the redox reaction}}.

Pure oxygen is needed {{to avoid poisoning the fuel cell by converting potassium hydroxide into [potassium carbonate](potassium%20carbonate.md)}}.
