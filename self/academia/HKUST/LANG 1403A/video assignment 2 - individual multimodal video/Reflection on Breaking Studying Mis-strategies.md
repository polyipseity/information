# Reflection on Breaking Studying Mis-strategies

In the video "Breaking Studying Mis-strategies", like the writing assignment before it, I worked on most of the content by myself. Generative AI (gen AI) is used to paraphrase my text in a semi-formal tone. I also tried to use some gen AI in my creative process but failed miserably. Since the last reflection focused heavily on generative AI, this time I will focus more on the creative process rather than generative AI.

I found gen AI lacking when it comes to the creative process. It was rather difficult to express the imagery in my head in words and then had gen AI to generate the desired images. The generated images almost always look off and were not suitable in my video. If you need text in your images, then you should not expect gen AI to do the work for you. The text generated is always a weird blend of characters. They vaguely look like actual characters, but reading it is impossible. And for animated media, currently available gen AI is simply unable to generate them (There are gen AIs online that can do so, but you need to set them up yourself and I am too lazy to do so. :P). So that was how I miserably failed to use gen AI for my creative process. The only use for it in my video is improving my script. To conclude, gen AI is really only good for text, which means scriptwriting. Maybe in the future this will change... and I surely hope so.

The second thing is that I realized the creative process of a video takes a whole lot of time! It requires scriptwriting, finding media or creating them, combining the media into a video, and proofreading. The whole process is interconnected. If you find any mistakes in the process, you might need to go back in the process and fix several things, taking a large amount of time! Not only that, it is challenging to make the visuals you want. The visuals might be extremely easy to make in your head, but not so when you actually try to make it in your computer. For example, the animations in my video require much planning to ensure the key frames are placed at the correct timing. And unfortunately, since I was also suffering from procrastination (very ironic when your video talks about beating procrastination ;P) when making this video, I barely had enough time to finish it. So the biggest challenge is not actually the creative process taking too long but rather time management. \*Sigh\*. Hopefully I can improve on this quickly.

To summarize, current gen AI is only useful for scriptwriting, but hopefully this will change in the future. And since I cannot use gen AI for most of the creative process, the process itself takes very long, especially since I want a high quality video. In the end, the biggest obstacle is time management and no amount of advanced gen AI can improve one's time management. I will and have to work on this myself in the future, so that I can complete any future video assignment comfortably.
