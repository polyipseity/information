# networking practicum reflection

The networking practicum was the first networking event that I had had, so I did not exactly know how the event would pan out. It turned out better than I expected and did not cause a scene. Apart from that, I learned something from the event, so here are the things that I have learned.

First thing is that I have learned that not everything that are needed in the job are taught by the school. Mr. Lau said that the the financial knowledge were trained on the job. It made me realize that learning is only part of success in university. Learning to learn is a skill is skill that is much more valuable than the knowledge that I already have. This is especially important in this ever-changing world, so I will try to train myself in this ability.

Second thing is that learning about new upcoming things from Mr. Liu. He is very enthusiastic about Web3 and talked about it a lot. While learning about extra knowledge is good, more importantly, it made me think how one would succeed in this world. Currently, Web3 is considered illegitimate by most people, especially after recent scandals. But it does not mean it will become big again. If I wait for it to become big before stepping into it, it be probably too late to succeed because the early adopters will already be established, so I need to step into it early, but it runs a risk of failing if Web3 truly fails. Perhaps success is all about risks?

Lastly, Ms. Del Vita talked about her experience in starting a translation company a long time ago. One memorable thing was her mentioning that accessing the Internet was very inconvenient. Compared to now, the difference is insurmountable. This point is not as important as the above points, but it made me think about how rapidly technology will develop in the future. I should get ready for this in my university life.

These are the three big and small things that I have learned in the networking practicum, and I hope to have further opportunities to attend similar events in the future.
