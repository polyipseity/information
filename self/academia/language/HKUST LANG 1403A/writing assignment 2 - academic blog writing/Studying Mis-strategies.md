# Studying Mis-strategies

Are you a student who always studies hard but struggles to get good results? Or a desperate teacher wanting to help students falling behind, but to no avail? Most pupils and instructors believe that hard work correlates with academic performance. While this quantitative perspective is appealing for its simplicity, it overlooks the crucial qualitative aspect of studying. Ignoring the quality of studying leads to a perpetual cycle of students failing to catch up and teachers failing to help them. To break this cycle, both students and teachers need to focus on quality study. One way to learn about quality study skills is by examining the opposite — ineffective study skills. In this blog post, we will discuss poor study strategies and how to improve them.

Reliable evidence suggests that students often adopt passive study strategies, which are generally ineffective. Study strategies are familiar to both students and teachers, but we seldom pay attention to how they work. This leads to adoption of poor study strategies. Thus, it is essential to know what types of study strategies there are and categorize them as effective or not. While many study strategies hae been identified in the literature, two influential studies have significantly different classifications. Miyatsu, Nguyen, and McDaniel (2018) identified five strategies: rereading, highlighting, note-taking, outlining, and flashcards. This study has been shared by many netizens, showing that many agree with the classification. In contrast, Walck-Shannon, Rowell, and Frey (2021) identified twelve strategies. The categories identified by the cross-disciplinary team are more specific, such as "completed old exams" and "reviewed online outside content". This highly-cited study also differs from the former study by classifying the techniques as active, passive, and mixed. The latter study's classification is more useful to us for determining the effectiveness of study strategies, as it concludes that active strategies are more effective than passive ones. The authors also show that pupils spent half of their study time on ineffective passive strategies. This unfortunate state of affairs can explain why some students fail to thrive despite working hard. Students and teachers looking to improve their strategies should consider adopting active strategies. In particular, the three popular strategies note-taking, outlining, and flashcards are active ones.

Although adopting active strategies is a step in the right direction, proper implementation is crucial for optimal results. Even ineffective ones can be improved with better execution. Miyatsu, Nguyen, and McDaniel (2018) discuss effective and ineffective implementations of both active and passive strategies, offering a balanced perspective of study strategies. For instance, they found that recalling information many times and spacing improve flashcards' effectiveness, while self-determined dropping of flashcards is detrimental to learning. In cases where the student struggles to change their ineffective strategies, improving their implementations can help mitigate the shortcoming. Thus, instructors should guide pupils towards effective implementations and away from detrimental practices. It might be easier than changing their study habits outright.

However, it is essential that instructors, like pupils, can have misconceptions on study habits. A study published on the reputable journal _Memory_ found that teachers have only marginally better knowledge of study strategies than students. In particular, they are only slightly more likely to recommend effective habits over ineffective ones when asked to compare two scenarios (Morehead, Rhodes, & DeLozier, 2016). The study's use of prior studies to confirm its results adds to its validity. Furthermore, an article published by the professional organization American Psychological Association (APA) observes that instructors prioritize teaching "study tips" over study skills, resulting in vague or unsupported advice. Thus, the knowledge of teachers fails to transfer to students. The article demonstrates this clearly using common tips like "Get plenty of sleep" and "Listening to Baroque music improves memory" (Chew, 2020). Both sources underscore teachers failing to influence students to adopt better study habits. How could students adopt active study habits if the teachers do not know either? Instructors should consider relearning study strategies from definitive sources in the literature. They should place more emphasis on study strategies in their teaching curriculum. Use authoritative materials like the teaching module linked in the APA article if possible.

In conclusion, both instructors and students often lack sufficient knowledge about effective study strategies. This leads to persistent struggles with academic performance for some students. Hard work cannot completely compensate for ineffective study habits. Despite extensive research into study skills since the last century, the knowledge has yet to permeate the public consciousness fully. In this 21st century world, knowledge is produced faster than ever. Thus, it is important for us to escape the trap of ineffective studying. Both teachers and students should engage with empirical research and actively seek to improve their understanding of effective study techniques.
