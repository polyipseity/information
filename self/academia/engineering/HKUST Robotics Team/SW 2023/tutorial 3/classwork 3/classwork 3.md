Try to control servo motor to turn to -90 degrees-> 0 degrees -> 90 degrees (with a short pause at 0 degrees
Note: for the servo motor we are using, the on-time at -90 degrees should be 0.5ms, and the ontime at 90 degrees should be 2.5ms. Calculate the on-time for 0 degrees on your own.
We are using TIM5 and channel 1
Bonus: control the angle of the motor with a button
