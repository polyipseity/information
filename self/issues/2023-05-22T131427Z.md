# weird artifacts in render by SheepIt Render Farm

## description

Weird artifacts shown below are present in the rendered frames by SheepIt Render Farm but not by my computer, which has an AMD GPU.

Initially, removing hair systems in the Blender file reduces the number of artifacts across the entire render. Then, rendering the frames on a computer with a Nvidia GPU reveals the problem to be caused by pixels with infinite values, which is caused by hairs in the hair systems via unknown mechanism.

See the related [forum post](https://www.sheepit-renderfarm.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2460) (archives: [local](../../archives/sparse/1dd00a095f344a61ab3e8f7713ed88e8eea6648c8379a36ac4e0ebb971fe2f57.md)).

## solution

Replace pixels with infinite luminance before passing the image to the glare node in the compositor.

## conclusion

Much time and points have been wasted on finding out about this because the bug does not appear on AMD GPUs, which I was using, but the render farm only uses Nvidia GPUs.
