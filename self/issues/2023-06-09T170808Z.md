# extremely slow audio mixdown in Blender

## description

Mixing down audio in Blender is extremely slow, taking several hours or even more.

After some extreme frustration and searching, [issue 68946](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/68946) (archives: [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20230610051004/https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/68946)) indirectly gives a clue. After some reading, it can be inferred that Blender renders the audio by going to every frame in your render. The time it takes to go to a frame is the same as the time needed to change a frame in the viewport. That means non-audio objects are also evaluated, which can be very expensive, even though they do not affect the results at all! If it takes a long time to change a frame, then the audio rendering will become extremely lengthly.

## solution

Disable all collections without speakers in the viewport before rendering the audio.

## conclusion

An entire day has been wasted on mixing down audio in Blender.
